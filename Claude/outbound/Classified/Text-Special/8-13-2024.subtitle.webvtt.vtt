do we all that third grade students only have 1 chance to

144
01:12:10.221 --> 01:12:11.817
be a third grade student.

145
01:12:11.817 --> 01:12:14.067
That sentiment holds true for all of our students

146
01:12:14.067 --> 01:12:16.745

157
01:12:54.259 --> 01:12:54.926
school.

158
01:12:54.927 --> 01:12:58.237
I dropped my little kid off at school.

159
01:12:58.237 --> 01:13:01.927
And I saw a whole bunch of happy faces.

160
01:13:01.927 --> 01:13:06.161
On students and parents on the parents side. I'm thinking

161
01:13:06.161 --> 01:13:08.747
they're glad to see them going back to school again.

162
01:13:08.747 --> 01:13:11.677
Or also just a relief.

163
01:13:11.677 --> 01:13:15.517
But it's also a great time to see the teacher smiling and

164
01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:19.687
getting engaged with the students. This is what we do.

165
01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:22.527
Classify has been here all summer long getting the rooms

166
01:13:22.527 --> 01:13:26.357
ready gain the technology ready getting everything ready

167
01:13:26.357 --> 01:13:27.927
for this school year.

168
01:13:27.927 --> 01:13:31.447
I want to knock on wood right now because still early in

169
01:13:31.447 --> 01:13:33.287
the day that

170
01:13:33.287 --> 01:13:36.047
it went without a hitch.

171
01:13:36.047 --> 01:13:41.597
Went great. This is 1 of the best start off that we had. I

172
01:13:41.597 --> 01:13:44.077
want to say right now in technology land.

173
01:13:44.077 --> 01:13:46.227
The phones were quiet.

174
01:13:46.227 --> 01:13:48.087
That's the great thing.

175
01:13:48.087 --> 01:13:50.947
But I imagine what the maintenance was dealing with.

176
01:13:50.947 --> 01:13:54.427
They're probably dealing with quietness too. I hope because

177
01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:57.997
we were working so hard this summer getting the rooms ready

178
01:13:57.997 --> 01:14:00.157
for the students and the teachers.

179
01:14:00.157 --> 01:14:04.227
Seeing our campuses wide open to the public.

180
01:14:04.227 --> 01:14:07.127
having the kids flushing right in

181
01:14:07.227 --> 01:14:10.447
They're happy. These kids were happy.

182
01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:14.337
Some were crying, but most of them were happy.

183
01:14:14.337 --> 01:14:18.459
But 1 thing is it's a great start of the school year, and I

184
01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:21.447
hope we could continue to make it a great 1 for this whole

185
01:14:21.447 --> 01:14:23.127
year. Thank you.

186
01:14:24.577 --> 01:14:27.047
All right. Thank you.

187
01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:32.455

oversight committee. Um

202
01:15:27.157 --> 01:15:31.807
We were a bit behind on the um, initial 20202021 reports due

203
01:15:31.807 --> 01:15:34.792
to committee turnover and um, we are now caught up so we

204
01:15:34.792 --> 01:15:39.247
should be up to date, um going forward. Um, this report is

205
01:15:39.247 --> 01:15:41.767
the culmination of a thorough review process where the

206
01:15:41.767 --> 01:15:44.132
committee meticulously examined and the expenditures

207
01:15:44.133 --> 01:15:46.927
related to the bond measures over the past year. We have

208
01:15:46.927 --> 01:15:50.467
received detailed Financial reports audited statements and

209
01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:53.227
project updates from The District staff these documents

210
01:15:53.227 --> 01:15:55.747
provided us with a calm comprehensive understanding of how

211
01:15:55.747 --> 01:15:59.027
the bond funds were allocated and spent on various projects

212
01:15:59.027 --> 01:16:00.517
at our school district.

213
01:16:00.517 --> 01:16:05.167
Um some key findings from our 20202021 fiscal year include

214
01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:08.227
the the um committee is pleased to report that the

215
01:16:08.227 --> 01:16:11.287
district's Bond expenditures were in full compliance with

216
01:16:11.287 --> 01:16:14.017
legal requirements outlined in the bond measures.

217
01:16:14.017 --> 01:16:18.123
Um significant process has been made on various projects

218
01:16:18.124 --> 01:16:21.037
with several key facilities completed ongoing projects are

219
01:16:21.037 --> 01:16:23.557
on schedule ensuring our students and staff benefit from

220
01:16:23.557 --> 01:16:26.857
these improvements, um, the financial statements and audit

221
01:16:26.857 --> 01:16:29.557
reports were accurate and consistent with the district's

222
01:16:29.557 --> 01:16:32.167
records and indicating prudent management of the bond

223
01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:32.887
funds.

224
01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:38.387
um moving on to the 2022 2023 reports, um similar to the

225
01:16:38.387 --> 01:16:40.593
previous years the committee found that the Dublin Unified

226
01:16:40.594 --> 01:16:42.887
School District remains in compliance with all relevant

227
01:16:42.887 --> 01:16:46.367
legal requirements and bod Provisions the project funded by

228
01:16:46.367 --> 01:16:49.727
a major ceh andj have been managed according to the

229
01:16:49.727 --> 01:16:53.297
approved criteria with no evidence of misallocated funds

230
01:16:53.297 --> 01:16:57.107
the funds, uh from measure ceh andj have

231
01:16:57.107 --> 01:16:59.707
Continue to support critical infrastructure projects, for

232
01:16:59.707 --> 01:17:02.807
example, um, significant advancements have been made to the

233
01:17:02.807 --> 01:17:06.947
Emerald High Phase 1 and 2, um projects under measure H and

234
01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:10.667
J. Um among others the completion of these projects will

235
01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:13.007
provide the state-of-the-art educational facility for our

236
01:17:13.007 --> 01:17:16.367
community, um, in terms of financial, uh stability the

237
01:17:16.367 --> 01:17:18.527
community also reviewed the financials which showed that

238
01:17:18.527 --> 01:17:21.875
the bond funds have been utilized effectively for instance

239
01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:24.707
the beginning balance for measure H was approximately 121

240
01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:27.593
million and after interest in expenditures, the ending

241
01:17:27.594 --> 01:17:31.247
balance is uh, 12.47 million these figures underscore the

242
01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:34.067
responsible allocation of resources towards a completion of

243
01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:37.223
ongoing projects. Um, additionally, I'd like to share that.

244
01:17:37.223 --> 01:17:41.267
Um, um, we are changing a a bit about how we're going to

245
01:17:41.267 --> 01:17:43.847
communicate these annual reports being presented to the

246
01:17:43.847 --> 01:17:47.867
community. Um last year we did a mailer. Um, we found that

247
01:17:47.867 --> 01:17:50.193
to be very costly. So what we're going to do going forward

248
01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:55.808
is um, presenting the um, um, like a QR code and a flyer at

249
01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:57.077
different, um, city like,

250
01:17:57.077 --> 01:17:59.848
City Hall and the Dublin Library and Senior Center places

251
01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:03.479
like that where they'll be visible to the community. Um

252
01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:06.699
We also intend to reach out to local media sources like the

253
01:18:06.699 --> 01:18:10.017
patch and the Independent to help so the word and um, this

254
01:18:10.017 --> 01:18:12.099
strategy will hopefully help um ensure that the community

255
01:18:12.099 --> 01:18:14.553
members especially those without students in the district

256
01:18:14.553 --> 01:18:17.559
remained informed without incurring any um, unnecessary

257
01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:19.629
expenses. Um,

258
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:23.359
that's pretty much what I have any any questions. I'm happy

259
01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:24.049
to answer.

260
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:27.579
Any board members have questions?

261
01:18:27.599 --> 01:18:30.834
All right, so I would on behalf of the board. Um, thank you

262
01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:32.962
for helping with this committee and all of your committee

263
01:18:32.962 --> 01:18:36.218
members. I know it's probably not the most exciting work.

264
01:18:36.219 --> 01:18:39.003
Um, but it's very important and it it's I think it helps,

265
01:18:39.003 --> 01:18:41.469
um build trust with the community that and to have, you

266
01:18:41.469 --> 01:18:45.279
know, a diverse group of parents, um and community members,

267
01:18:45.279 --> 01:18:47.919
um, helping, you know, keep an eye on everything and show

268
01:18:47.919 --> 01:18:49.149
that we're using it and

269
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:51.469
and um, we got to

270
01:18:51.469 --> 01:18:54.009
have students at Emerald today. So it's it makes it even

271
01:18:54.009 --> 01:18:56.749
more exciting to kind of bring it back today. So thank you

272
01:18:56.749 --> 01:19:00.309
for all of your efforts. Um, do we need to approve this or

273
01:19:00.309 --> 01:19:01.839
is this just an information?

274
01:19:01.839 --> 01:19:06.199
Um, I believe it's um just information, okay?

275
01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:08.709
Then I won't even call for a vote. So, but thank you very

276
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:12.009
much and thank you to the rest of your committee. Um

277
01:19:12.009 --> 01:19:14.379
wherever they are tonight appreciate.

278
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:21.869
All righty. Um next we have our public comment period um

279
01:19:21.869 --> 01:19:24.469
If there's anyone do we have any?

280
01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:26.949
We have 2 public comments.

281
01:19:26.949 --> 01:19:31.629
In person or in person? Okay, you may come up. Um, there'll

282
01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:34.809
be a 3 Minute Timer just a reminder. We are not allowed to

283
01:19:34.809 --> 01:19:37.209
engage in a conversation back and forth.

284
01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:40.959
Um during public comment, but we do listen and we will hear

285
01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:43.539
what you have to say and thanks, so.

286
01:19:43.539 --> 01:19:47.141
Go ahead. I believe our first speaker is Christy. Is that

287
01:19:47.141 --> 01:19:49.769
correct? Yes Christy Marlowe.

288
01:19:51.689 --> 01:19:55.809
Uh, good evening, uh wanted to congratulate the whole

289
01:19:55.809 --> 01:19:58.491
District on the opening of Emerald High School. Um, my

290
01:19:58.491 --> 01:20:01.508
family is very excited. It's open. I have a sophomore

291
01:20:01.509 --> 01:20:04.749
there. Um, I also live right across the street at the

292
01:20:04.749 --> 01:20:08.829
corner of Central and Grafton. Um, I was very happy this

293
01:20:08.829 --> 01:20:12.189
morning to see a lot of students walking and biking to

294
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:15.129
school. Um, I'm here to talk a little bit more about how

295
01:20:15.129 --> 01:20:17.589
things could be better for those students, uh that want to

296
01:20:17.589 --> 01:20:19.629
walk and Bike to School. Uh,

297
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:23.339
when the construction fences came down earlier this year

298
01:20:23.339 --> 01:20:25.939
and all the Portables were moved out of the way I was

299
01:20:25.939 --> 01:20:29.629
a little bit disappointed to see um

300
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:31.364
how

301
01:20:31.364 --> 01:20:36.044
few bike racks there were um and also,

302
01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:37.144
uh

303
01:20:37.144 --> 01:20:39.354
The it seemed like there wasn't a lot of thought given to

304
01:20:39.354 --> 01:20:42.274
how a student would access the campus without being dropped

305
01:20:42.274 --> 01:20:44.814
off in a car. Um,

306
01:20:44.814 --> 01:20:46.154
uh

307
01:20:46.154 --> 01:20:49.469
So it would you know, this is supposed to be a neighborhood

308
01:20:49.469 --> 01:20:54.784
School. Uh, it seems like it should be easy to access by

309
01:20:54.784 --> 01:20:58.754
walking or biking. Um, so

310
01:20:58.754 --> 01:21:01.114
this morning, uh

311
01:21:01.114 --> 01:21:04.994
I walked over after the bell rang to the bike racks and

312
01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:08.174
they were completely full. Um, there are fewer bike racks

313
01:21:08.174 --> 01:21:10.934
there than there are at Fallon and if you've ever been to

314
01:21:10.934 --> 01:21:13.584
Fallon, you know, the bike racks fill up every day. Um, and

315
01:21:13.584 --> 01:21:16.154
those bikes are like locked in a cage. So if you don't get

316
01:21:16.154 --> 01:21:19.274
a spot on the rack, at least your bike is locked up and

317
01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:22.394
that's not the case at emeralds. Um,

318
01:21:22.394 --> 01:21:25.594
I assume it's a similar situation at Cottonwood Creek, uh

319
01:21:25.594 --> 01:21:27.754
students want a bike. Um

320
01:21:27.754 --> 01:21:32.169
Uh, but today I Saw 2 students who showed up late be turned

321
01:21:32.169 --> 01:21:34.789
away because there was we got an email the night before

322
01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:38.963
that. No bikes could be locked to a fence or to a poll. So

323
01:21:38.964 --> 01:21:41.424
they were wandering around trying to find a place to put

324
01:21:41.424 --> 01:21:44.784
their bikes and they basically they left they went home.

325
01:21:44.784 --> 01:21:47.004
They had to go back home to drop their bikes back off and

326
01:21:47.004 --> 01:21:49.164
then get to school with some other way. So I'm sure those

327
01:21:49.164 --> 01:21:51.774
kids were probably discouraged from ever trying.

328
01:21:51.774 --> 01:21:54.794
To bike to school again. Um

329
01:21:54.794 --> 01:21:56.704
also the

330
01:21:56.704 --> 01:22:00.274
um crosswalk at Central and Grafton

331
01:22:00.274 --> 01:22:06.374
leads to nothing like it's just there's bushes. Um, I saw

332
01:22:06.524 --> 01:22:10.309
A month or so ago, um, that kind of realized like, oh,

333
01:22:10.309 --> 01:22:13.643
there's no way to get from here to campus. So they hastily

334
01:22:13.644 --> 01:22:18.684
installed a crosswalk through the parking lot. Um, but it's

335
01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:21.044
not obvious that it's there. So students just were walking

336
01:22:21.044 --> 01:22:26.004
in traffic. Um, so that's a little bit concerning. Um, and

337
01:22:26.004 --> 01:22:28.764
we know that you've identified that it's going to be 24

338
01:22:28.764 --> 01:22:31.344
million dollars for parking garage and maybe you don't need

339
01:22:31.344 --> 01:22:34.572
that parking garage. If you could encourage more kids to

340
01:22:34.572 --> 01:22:38.064
walk and Bike to School, um by making it a lot easier and

341
01:22:38.064 --> 01:22:42.786
more, you know walk and bike friendly for them. Um, I would

342
01:22:42.787 --> 01:22:44.784
encourage you to reach out to

343
01:22:44.784 --> 01:22:47.734
almina County safe for us to school for a School site

344
01:22:47.734 --> 01:22:51.214
assessment. They're fantastic resource. I would be happy to

345
01:22:51.214 --> 01:22:53.644
connect you because I've worked with them a lot. So

346
01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:55.984
that's all I got. Thank you.

347
01:22:56.094 --> 01:22:59.614
Our next speaker is Ruth Ryman, or

348
01:22:59.614 --> 01:23:01.031
I think I said that right.

349
01:23:02.531 --> 01:23:07.803
Um, uh, I want to congratulate you for opening Emerald High

350
01:23:07.803 --> 01:23:10.191
School like Christie. I live across the street. I live

351
01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:12.513
about can I have you go close to the mic? So the view there

352
01:23:12.514 --> 01:23:16.371
you go. Okay. I I know I'm I am my voice doesn't carry very

353
01:23:16.371 --> 01:23:19.299
well. Um, I want to congratulate you for opening Emerald

354
01:23:19.299 --> 01:23:22.971
High School. I like Christy live very very close. I live

355
01:23:22.971 --> 01:23:26.991
about a block from Christie, um in the Sarto Community, uh,

356
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.691
which faces the main office of Emerald High School. Um, I

357
01:23:32.691 --> 01:23:35.631
noticed a couple of things and like first of all the school

358
01:23:35.631 --> 01:23:38.031
is beautiful. I did the open house and it's stunning and

359
01:23:38.031 --> 01:23:40.991
I'm so happy and I cannot wait for the theater to open up

360
01:23:40.991 --> 01:23:43.371
and I think there's a lot of kids that are lost without

361
01:23:43.371 --> 01:23:46.611
theater. So I'm I'm looking forward to that time when the

362
01:23:46.611 --> 01:23:50.271
theater can open so I'm happy about that. But um, I was

363
01:23:50.271 --> 01:23:55.062
hoping to ask you to encourage the school to be a good

364
01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:59.411
neighbor. We have um, 3 communities that are very densely

365
01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:03.081
packed. There's the colonies that's just to the West

366
01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:06.361
Uh a set of I don't know the name of the apartments that

367
01:24:06.361 --> 01:24:09.961
are to the to the East and then serrento directly north.

368
01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:15.221
And all of those are dense housing. Um, I live in Stow.

369
01:24:15.221 --> 01:24:20.931
Tonette town houses, and and it is often, uh difficult to

370
01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:24.631
move around like over here at Dublin High School. It's

371
01:24:24.631 --> 01:24:27.511
difficult to move around during open and closing times of

372
01:24:27.511 --> 01:24:32.551
the school today. However, when I was driving it again it

373
01:24:32.551 --> 01:24:35.623
it's not the school. That's the issue. It's the parents. So

374
01:24:35.623 --> 01:24:39.121
I'm hoping maybe you can encourage the parents today.

375
01:24:39.121 --> 01:24:42.061
Right after I drop Christy home.

376
01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:47.106
There is this parent had stopped in the middle of um, I

377
01:24:47.106 --> 01:24:51.501
think it's gleon that runs north south. But whichever the

378
01:24:51.501 --> 01:24:54.441
north south throat is Grafton.

379
01:24:54.441 --> 01:24:58.071
This parent stopped directly in the middle and loaded their

380
01:24:58.071 --> 01:25:01.251
child, but that whole Lane had stopped. I realized because

381
01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:05.631
multiple parents were picking up their children from the

382
01:25:05.631 --> 01:25:10.131
only it is a single Lane Road from the only lane and then

383
01:25:10.131 --> 01:25:14.619
this parent while I was stopped at the roundabout which you

384
01:25:14.619 --> 01:25:18.171
can sort of see that I'm on a corner while I was stopped at

385
01:25:18.171 --> 01:25:19.611
this roundabout.

386
01:25:19.611 --> 01:25:23.865
This person nearly hit me while driving on the roundabout

387
01:25:23.865 --> 01:25:26.781
you can see their tires are literally up on top of the

388
01:25:26.781 --> 01:25:29.541
roundabout. I do have their license plate number.

389
01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:30.791
um

390
01:25:31.987 --> 01:25:36.647
Which I can enter into record. But um, but then the other

391
01:25:36.647 --> 01:25:40.607
thing is there are parents who are picking up their

392
01:25:40.607 --> 01:25:43.487
children directly in the bike Lanes. So Christie had all

393
01:25:43.487 --> 01:25:45.497
the comments about the bike lane.

394
01:25:45.497 --> 01:25:49.147
And yet you have parents parking in the bike lane where

395
01:25:49.147 --> 01:25:52.563
kids should feel safe to bike to and from school. And then

396
01:25:52.563 --> 01:25:57.327
the last thing is, um, if we could please uh, turn down the

397
01:25:57.327 --> 01:26:00.747
lighting around the school to you know, obviously you want

398
01:26:00.747 --> 01:26:03.567
to make sure that it's visible to the whether or not

399
01:26:03.567 --> 01:26:07.527
there's a trespassers but some of us live there and it is

400
01:26:07.527 --> 01:26:11.217
so bright at night now, please wrap up. All right.

401
01:26:11.217 --> 01:26:12.767
Thank you. Thanks.

402
01:26:15.857 --> 01:26:19.257
Do we have any others and there's no 1 online? All right.

403
01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:20.247
Thank you.

404
01:26:21.847 --> 01:26:24.227
Appreciate the feedback.

405
01:26:24.227 --> 01:26:27.597
Um next we have um

406
01:26:27.597 --> 01:26:31.917
a lot of board policies to discuss tonight and I think we

407
01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:36.057
are starting with um superintendent on a some

408
01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:42.597
Right. Yes i1. Uh, this is a revision to board policy 9220.

409
01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:46.497
There are 2 components 1 just some csba language updates,

410
01:26:46.497 --> 01:26:51.453
but also, uh back in uh, July the board also approved

411
01:26:51.453 --> 01:26:55.437
increasing, uh, the contribution that the district makes to

412
01:26:55.437 --> 01:27:00.777
candidates running for trustee, uh, uh seats, uh to um,

413
01:27:01.377 --> 01:27:03.427
Is it 800?

414
01:27:03.947 --> 01:27:08.092
$800 can let me open that 1 just to confirm I believe it

415
01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:09.416
was $800.

416
01:27:11.357 --> 01:27:15.810
Yeah, $800. Uh, so other otherwise all the other language

417
01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:19.766
is straight. Um csba updated language.

418
01:27:21.257 --> 01:27:23.577
any questions for this 1

419
01:27:23.577 --> 01:27:25.217
trustee Blackman

420
01:27:26.157 --> 01:27:29.065
Thank you for bringing this forward. So I I had a couple

421
01:27:29.065 --> 01:27:32.521
questions. I understand csba update this. Somebody says Eid

422
01:27:32.521 --> 01:27:36.007
code. Um, I was curious. Um

423
01:27:36.007 --> 01:27:38.947
Maybe it's just an echo issue but Echo declares as a

424
01:27:38.947 --> 01:27:42.007
citizens of California. I understand we're residents of

425
01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.987
California, but we're I thought we were citizens of the

426
01:27:43.987 --> 01:27:45.637
United States. I don't know that we ever.

427
01:27:45.637 --> 01:27:48.957
Again going to the driver's license associate with the

428
01:27:48.957 --> 01:27:50.611
state of California. Is there anything legally that states

429
01:27:50.611 --> 01:27:53.336
that we're citizens of California anywhere in any document?

430
01:27:53.337 --> 01:27:55.797
It just seems like really strange wording. And I know it's

431
01:27:55.797 --> 01:27:59.527
a code, but I think that if you go to the registers office,

432
01:27:59.527 --> 01:28:01.677
it's they have to be assisted in the United States and a

433
01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:02.907
resident of California.

434
01:28:02.907 --> 01:28:06.150
Um, I was certainly looked at that. Thank you, but it is an

435
01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:09.198
EDC code. It's just very weird, um in the first paragraph.

436
01:28:09.198 --> 01:28:12.510
Um, so a couple things I noticed in terms of some of the

437
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:15.263
minor edits the Almeida County Office of registers actually

438
01:28:15.264 --> 01:28:17.850
has a really good website with information on it and

439
01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:19.727
they're pretty detailed. It must be is behind the scenes

440
01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:22.470
where you receive documents and information 1 of the

441
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:24.150
components that talked about when you discussed the

442
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:27.570
statement piece is that um, they give you these options to

443
01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:30.186
actually write a statement you can actually submit it

444
01:28:30.186 --> 01:28:32.550
electronically and I noticed in our documents, we actually

445
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:35.370
state that you could actually pay for a statement or you

446
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:38.070
could have the ability to post an electronic statement, but

447
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:40.662
I don't think that's actually what the county does they ask

448
01:28:40.662 --> 01:28:43.590
you to submit a statement electronically so that that's how

449
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:47.070
they receive it into the record for them to print the

450
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:50.670
statements for the election. I don't believe they post the

451
01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:53.115
statements electronically, so it'd be helpful to update

452
01:28:53.115 --> 01:28:56.490
that information. Um, there are a couple of minor comments

453
01:28:56.490 --> 01:29:00.960
that I had that I thought would help you update. But um,

454
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.440
otherwise, there's um

455
01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.980
There's some pieces in here that I would just ask that we

456
01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:10.568
verify with the county because they have very specific

457
01:29:10.568 --> 01:29:13.490
procedural pieces and information they provide candidates

458
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:16.100
and we might not want to repeat it here, but rather just

459
01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.900
reference what they have.

460
01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:21.110
Thank you. Thank you.

461
01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.520
other comments

462
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:25.150
trustee Co

463
01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:29.390
yes, I was reading this and

464
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:32.782
the section under election process and procedures second

465
01:29:32.783 --> 01:29:35.880
paragraph. It's something that's added because is new. It's

466
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.115
in green text. Um just clarification on that. It sounds

467
01:29:40.115 --> 01:29:40.890
like

468
01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:46.072
if there's no board member there was elected for that term

469
01:29:46.072 --> 01:29:50.260
that coming term the the existing 1 to the 1 with the

470
01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:54.055
expired terms such as myself if no 1 comes forward for

471
01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.000
every 3.

472
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.850
Oom sha continue to discharge a duties is that

473
01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:00.700
um

474
01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.150
What does that mean? That means that?

475
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:04.780
I'm on the

476
01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.970
yeah, can you can you point to 1 more time for me? Yeah

477
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:11.810
collection process and procedures. It's on page 2. Oh,

478
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:15.452
thank you and then second paragraph of that a board member

479
01:30:15.453 --> 01:30:17.954
whose term has expired shall continue to discharge the

480
01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:20.150
duties until a successor is found.

481
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:22.760
And that's from that code.

482
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.380
Say it again. I'm sorry. It says.

483
01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:32.580
The successor has qualified by taking the oath of office.

484
01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:37.790
So it doesn't mean until it's filled with particularly on

485
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:38.890
the election case.

486
01:30:40.122 --> 01:30:44.032
so my question would be um

487
01:30:44.202 --> 01:30:47.792
Hypothetically No 1 comes forward for Area 3. I will

488
01:30:47.792 --> 01:30:52.402
continue to serve with that Shaw you would continue to

489
01:30:52.402 --> 01:30:57.836
serve up until um the end of your term the next uh policy

490
01:30:57.836 --> 01:31:01.821
is very specific. It's an update so that if no, 1 applied,

491
01:31:01.822 --> 01:31:06.232
uh, the board, uh, which the deadline is tomorrow, uh, 5:00

492
01:31:06.232 --> 01:31:10.090
pm then from that time to the time of the election the day

493
01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:12.892
before the election the board will then appoint a person

494
01:31:12.892 --> 01:31:15.562
who will then officially start in December?

495
01:31:15.562 --> 01:31:17.742
I see. Okay, so just

496
01:31:18.302 --> 01:31:21.042
oh, all right. I just misread that because I wasn't sure

497
01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.375
exactly what that meant. We're not going to keep although

498
01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:25.091
we would love to keep you. We're not going to keep you

499
01:31:25.092 --> 01:31:26.352
beyond your term.

500
01:31:26.352 --> 01:31:27.442
Thank you.

501
01:31:27.532 --> 01:31:29.282
trustee Blackman

502
01:31:29.282 --> 01:31:31.702
I'm glad that William brought that up because I was going

503
01:31:31.702 --> 01:31:34.406
to ask about that piece when we get to the next item

504
01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:37.442
reflecting back on this 1 it would help if there was a

505
01:31:37.442 --> 01:31:40.982
little bit more clarity between the 2 policies because of

506
01:31:40.982 --> 01:31:44.342
the fact that 1 sort of States something that seems to be

507
01:31:44.342 --> 01:31:47.642
in somewhat obscurity or conflict with what stated here and

508
01:31:47.642 --> 01:31:50.072
it is confusing when you do read it.

509
01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:52.752
We'll take a look and see if we can make it clear. Just

510
01:31:52.752 --> 01:31:54.722
something that would be really great. Thank you.

511
01:31:55.962 --> 01:31:59.002
Okay, so that's the first read and we'll bring that back to

512
01:31:59.002 --> 01:32:04.187
the next board meeting in August. Uh, and then I too uh,

513
01:32:04.188 --> 01:32:08.302
again this 1 is specifically, uh time wise is a perfect

514
01:32:08.302 --> 01:32:13.162
timing and it is csba language, uh and updates and so the

515
01:32:13.162 --> 01:32:18.882
key right now is that um, the deadline is, you know was

516
01:32:18.882 --> 01:32:24.382
last Friday, um and to uh, trustee quo, um has announced

517
01:32:24.382 --> 01:32:29.302
that he is not running. So therefore when uh, uh incumbent

518
01:32:29.302 --> 01:32:33.274
candidate does not run, uh, then there's an extension, uh

519
01:32:33.274 --> 01:32:35.902
to the deadline for applications and that's a 5-day

520
01:32:35.902 --> 01:32:39.682
extension. Uh, and that is until uh, the 14th at 5:00 pm,

521
01:32:39.682 --> 01:32:44.722
which is tomorrow. Um, if no 1 app at that point in time,

522
01:32:44.722 --> 01:32:50.062
um, then the board has from that next date, which is the

523
01:32:50.062 --> 01:32:55.102
15th and before the November election, uh to appoint. Uh,

524
01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:56.662
Mr. Crow's successor, uh,

525
01:32:56.662 --> 01:33:01.610
And that person would then start uh in uh, December with

526
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:06.441
everyone else, um, the board would uh under the direction

527
01:33:06.441 --> 01:33:11.311
of the president determine, uh, you know between the next 8

528
01:33:11.312 --> 01:33:16.000
weeks when uh to hold, um, the application process what the

529
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:19.427
application process will be and what have you so uh, that

530
01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.042
is really the

531
01:33:20.042 --> 01:33:23.298
Updated timing. Now. If only 1 person uh pulls paper

532
01:33:23.299 --> 01:33:27.059
officially by tomorrow, then that person will run unopposed

533
01:33:27.059 --> 01:33:32.549
uh similar to area 4, uh with Miss, uh, Blackman. So, um

534
01:33:32.549 --> 01:33:35.479
tomorrow is a key deadline, uh for Area 3.

535
01:33:36.219 --> 01:33:39.439
Any questions on this particular topic trustee spec and

536
01:33:39.439 --> 01:33:40.069
then I have a question.

537
01:33:40.069 --> 01:33:43.909
Yeah, I have some questions. Um on number 6.

538
01:33:43.909 --> 01:33:45.929
on the first page

539
01:33:45.929 --> 01:33:51.009
Um, it says a board member, um, so it's talking about um

540
01:33:51.009 --> 01:33:54.909
reasons a vacancy that you'd have a vacancy. Uh, and this

541
01:33:54.909 --> 01:33:58.329
is a board member ceases to enhance inhabit the trustee

542
01:33:58.329 --> 01:34:01.329
area represented by the board member. Um, and I feel like

543
01:34:01.329 --> 01:34:05.589
we might need to clarify this statement because that is

544
01:34:05.589 --> 01:34:08.079
actually happened over the last 2 years, but that was okay

545
01:34:08.079 --> 01:34:12.489
and legal, um where we had a board member who was elected

546
01:34:12.489 --> 01:34:15.549
to a certain area and then the maps changed as they um can

547
01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:18.969
do every 10 years and then that board member did not

548
01:34:18.969 --> 01:34:22.269
inhabit the trustee area but was able to be to represent

549
01:34:22.269 --> 01:34:24.909
that are area. So I feel like some more language needs to

550
01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:26.319
get in here because

551
01:34:26.319 --> 01:34:29.999
just the way it's stated is not actually accurate for how

552
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.789
we've operated for the last 2 years. Gotcha.

553
01:34:33.039 --> 01:34:37.189
Um, so that's 1 Point. Um,

554
01:34:41.559 --> 01:34:44.959
and then I guess I would so that was a very specific

555
01:34:44.959 --> 01:34:50.779
example. Um, but I guess I do want clarification if you are

556
01:34:50.779 --> 01:34:53.809
elected to an area and you move.

557
01:34:53.809 --> 01:34:55.789
But you're still in Dublin.

558
01:34:55.789 --> 01:34:58.529
But you're not in the area. Does that mean you have to give

559
01:34:58.529 --> 01:34:59.699
up your seat?

560
01:35:00.809 --> 01:35:04.089
So I'm seeing a shaking head. Yes. That's correct. Okay, so

561
01:35:04.089 --> 01:35:06.519
there's just 1 way that you can

562
01:35:06.549 --> 01:35:09.229
um keep your seat.

563
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:12.449
And that is if you were essentially the map changes and

564
01:35:12.449 --> 01:35:14.814
you're no longer in it, correct that you still have time in

565
01:35:14.814 --> 01:35:17.188
your term. Oh, you still have time in your term? Okay.

566
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:18.889
um

567
01:35:18.889 --> 01:35:21.079
the um

568
01:35:21.079 --> 01:35:23.679
the last sentence

569
01:35:28.379 --> 01:35:31.839
uh, the very last sentence when is authorized by law the

570
01:35:31.839 --> 01:35:34.479
board seeks to make an appointment because of a failure to

571
01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:37.239
elect the board by resolution May approve any additional

572
01:35:37.239 --> 01:35:40.419
procedures for selecting the person to be appointed to fill

573
01:35:40.419 --> 01:35:41.769
the vacancy.

574
01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:44.814
Can you give me an example like what what are we talking

575
01:35:44.814 --> 01:35:48.069
about here? It's just very Broad and I'm not really and I

576
01:35:48.069 --> 01:35:51.969
don't understand what is referencing. So so basically the

577
01:35:51.969 --> 01:35:55.389
board will pass a resolution that has the criteria for

578
01:35:55.389 --> 01:35:59.469
people to apply and the process that the board will follow

579
01:35:59.469 --> 01:36:02.739
to um, choose that pairs that that can

580
01:36:02.739 --> 01:36:06.541
It and so it will be published so that everyone knows during

581
01:36:06.541 --> 01:36:10.981
that timeline. What is the criteria when the um

582
01:36:10.981 --> 01:36:14.271
When the actual interviews will take place and and the

583
01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:16.731
selection process. Okay. So the procedure is really more of

584
01:36:16.731 --> 01:36:20.971
a kind of logistical thing of correct. Yes. Okay. Okay, and

585
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.771
then um, my my last question which I didn't see in here is

586
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:27.411
what if no 1 comes forward.

587
01:36:27.411 --> 01:36:31.491
So we'll continue the example. You have Area 3 if no 1

588
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:34.971
posts tomorrow and then we we say, okay, we're you know, we

589
01:36:34.971 --> 01:36:39.261
we we put our procedures out and no 1 comes forward.

590
01:36:40.491 --> 01:36:44.191
I don't have an answer for that question. I will find it,

591
01:36:44.191 --> 01:36:47.491
uh get it by legal before uh the next time and if we need

592
01:36:47.491 --> 01:36:51.504
to add language that helps that answer that um specific

593
01:36:51.504 --> 01:36:55.050
example, we'll add that language. Okay? Yeah. I mean it

594
01:36:55.051 --> 01:36:58.471
hasn't happened obvious. I mean every time in the, you know

595
01:36:58.471 --> 01:37:01.411
future that I or the past I you know recalled where we've

596
01:37:01.411 --> 01:37:04.231
had we've always had several actually, but

597
01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:07.486
I there's always a first for everything. So I think we

598
01:37:07.486 --> 01:37:10.011
should just maybe be prepared if if no 1 actually came

599
01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:10.891
forward.

600
01:37:11.211 --> 01:37:12.961
That was all I have.

601
01:37:13.621 --> 01:37:16.001
trustee quo and then trustee Blackman

602
01:37:16.991 --> 01:37:22.521
I distribute a coupon so is a term prior to the day fix for

603
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:26.751
the election. That's what you mean by tomorrow. I mean on

604
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:27.801
page 3

605
01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:30.021
because I'm trying to read up because when I read through

606
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:33.021
this I didn't get the idea that the appointment would

607
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:33.771
occur.

608
01:37:33.771 --> 01:37:37.031
Like in the next couple weeks because it sounds like if no

609
01:37:37.031 --> 01:37:40.151
1 steps forward. If no 1 steps forward tomorrow at 5:00 pm

610
01:37:40.151 --> 01:37:44.531
the board must uh appoint someone prior to the election

611
01:37:44.531 --> 01:37:46.421
date and

612
01:37:46.421 --> 01:37:49.501
So is that what the term being here a meeting prior to the

613
01:37:49.501 --> 01:37:53.791
day fixed 4 Day election, and I just trying to find.

614
01:37:53.791 --> 01:37:57.571
Fix for can we clarify that or just make it understandable

615
01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:59.581
because I didn't catch that.

616
01:37:59.581 --> 01:38:03.461
That term fixed we'll review it and see if we can make it

617
01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:06.131
clear. Yeah, right picture. Yeah, because I'm not sure what

618
01:38:06.131 --> 01:38:07.331
fixer election meant so

619
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:09.431
trusty Blackman

620
01:38:09.431 --> 01:38:12.821
I actually agree with some of the comments that um trustee

621
01:38:12.821 --> 01:38:15.581
Speck and trustee Co made those were all serious. I thought

622
01:38:15.581 --> 01:38:18.341
were confusing to follow up which what trustee Co had

623
01:38:18.341 --> 01:38:20.661
stated that maybe a sub paragraph that were actually on

624
01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:23.921
word salad the description that makes it so confusing to

625
01:38:23.921 --> 01:38:26.771
understand about what exactly the next steps are. If in

626
01:38:26.771 --> 01:38:29.616
fact nobody steps forward to qualify for a neck protection

627
01:38:29.616 --> 01:38:32.560
in the seat. That would be helpful. Um, I do agree that the

628
01:38:32.561 --> 01:38:36.701
last paragraph, um, when authorized by law and I understand

629
01:38:36.701 --> 01:38:39.461
your your description of the resolution, but I actually

630
01:38:39.461 --> 01:38:41.466
think that there should be if we're talking about board

631
01:38:41.467 --> 01:38:42.911
policy there should perhaps be more

632
01:38:42.911 --> 01:38:47.369
Specifics about what the resolution is designed to do to in

633
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:51.742
fact sculpt out the process the schedule may be the our

634
01:38:51.742 --> 01:38:53.602
qualifications. We do know some of those are from the

635
01:38:53.602 --> 01:38:56.398
county about as you mentioned before being a resident

636
01:38:56.398 --> 01:38:59.002
living in the area of the things like that. I think that

637
01:38:59.002 --> 01:39:01.822
would really help us understand because when I I looked at

638
01:39:01.822 --> 01:39:04.022
this I thought this leaves it really wide open and it could

639
01:39:04.022 --> 01:39:08.362
change from a board now to a board in 10 years could have

640
01:39:08.362 --> 01:39:11.342
very different ideas about how to do this and there should

641
01:39:11.342 --> 01:39:14.107
be some level of thoroughness and consistency. I think so

642
01:39:14.107 --> 01:39:17.902
maybe some structure to it would help. Um, just to give an

643
01:39:17.902 --> 01:39:19.882
idea about the things that we would need to consider in a

644
01:39:19.882 --> 01:39:21.922
resolution. I think it'd be great, but I don't want to go

645
01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:23.002
back. Um,

646
01:39:23.002 --> 01:39:27.265
Because I found this section, um under item number 3. I

647
01:39:27.265 --> 01:39:30.175
actually found that we crossed off and maybe it's somewhere

648
01:39:30.176 --> 01:39:32.258
else in the code because a lot of this has been moved

649
01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:35.832
around but I actually found that the paragraph under 3 that

650
01:39:35.832 --> 01:39:38.809
describes. I know this is Ed code and it's been Rewritten

651
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:41.667
but it actually does a pretty good job of describing 1 of

652
01:39:41.667 --> 01:39:44.772
what a vacancy is when it happens how it happens and why we

653
01:39:44.772 --> 01:39:46.889
have to do these things and I think that's a good

654
01:39:46.889 --> 01:39:48.923
introduction to understanding why we actually have to have

655
01:39:48.924 --> 01:39:51.252
this board resolution. Not that we anticipate we'll have a

656
01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:53.632
vacancy but these are circumstances that occur and this is

657
01:39:53.632 --> 01:39:56.307
why we do these, you know, 3 or 4 different situations that

658
01:39:56.307 --> 01:39:58.822
we have to address. So I appreciate it being there, but I

659
01:39:58.822 --> 01:40:00.420
know it got crossed off because it's probably been updated

660
01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:02.892
but I really liked where it was at the beginning. Um,

661
01:40:02.892 --> 01:40:09.052
So when we are describing a a board member who moves which

662
01:40:09.052 --> 01:40:10.402
I think was an important.

663
01:40:10.402 --> 01:40:13.384
I'm sorry to interrupt you. But what 3 are you referring

664
01:40:13.384 --> 01:40:17.070
to? Are you the last comment on page 1 on page 1 yes, it

665
01:40:17.071 --> 01:40:19.162
says events causing a vacancy and there's this whole

666
01:40:19.162 --> 01:40:21.562
section number 3 that actually does a really good job. I

667
01:40:21.562 --> 01:40:24.052
know it may be old egg coat but it does a nice job of

668
01:40:24.052 --> 01:40:26.982
actually explaining the is behind a vacancy and I think if

669
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.482
you're anybody coming to the board looking at what the

670
01:40:29.482 --> 01:40:31.932
policy is all about that does a really nice job explaining

671
01:40:31.932 --> 01:40:34.342
what we're thinking with the issue is why it occurs and

672
01:40:34.342 --> 01:40:37.042
what we're supposed to do. Um, it maybe doesn't need the

673
01:40:37.042 --> 01:40:39.262
details about the dates and the days but I actually thought

674
01:40:39.262 --> 01:40:41.202
there was some thing about it. That was nice having it up

675
01:40:41.202 --> 01:40:42.172
in that section.

676
01:40:42.172 --> 01:40:45.282
um, maybe you don't have to include that it was old Ed

677
01:40:45.282 --> 01:40:47.242
cope, but maybe just something that kind of summarized that

678
01:40:47.242 --> 01:40:47.902
um,

679
01:40:48.672 --> 01:40:50.722
there the um

680
01:40:50.722 --> 01:40:53.532
question I had about there's a lot of things about days and

681
01:40:53.532 --> 01:40:57.552
dates 60 days versus 90 days. Um versus 6 months. It'd be

682
01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:01.032
nice if there is consistency and is it really days or is it

683
01:41:01.032 --> 01:41:04.332
months? Um, that was 1 of the comments I made um and item

684
01:41:04.332 --> 01:41:06.612
number 10 on the second page. There's something I don't

685
01:41:06.612 --> 01:41:10.212
know what it is. It says that um the board members refusal

686
01:41:10.212 --> 01:41:14.112
or neglect to file the required oath or Bond within the

687
01:41:14.112 --> 01:41:15.402
time prescribed.

688
01:41:15.438 --> 01:41:19.558
What do you mean by bond? Is this for like a different kind

689
01:41:19.558 --> 01:41:22.258
of election where people have to put forward?

690
01:41:22.258 --> 01:41:23.858
some type of

691
01:41:24.538 --> 01:41:28.328
bond fund to secure being on the ballot. I didn't

692
01:41:28.328 --> 01:41:31.934
understand what Bond was in that statement. Yeah. I'm not

693
01:41:31.934 --> 01:41:34.898
the bond is replacing the oath, but I'm not sure what the

694
01:41:34.898 --> 01:41:39.088
bond how much it is or what it means so I I can find that

695
01:41:39.088 --> 01:41:41.668
out. Okay. Thank you because I I would be more confused

696
01:41:41.668 --> 01:41:42.428
ring this.

697
01:41:42.428 --> 01:41:46.248
And it would be helpful to know what that is. Um also in

698
01:41:46.418 --> 01:41:53.688
the item number 11, if there be some explanation about what

699
01:41:53.688 --> 01:41:56.948
exactly um transpires how that's created or anything about

700
01:41:56.948 --> 01:42:00.634
that what triggers it? For example, I think that would be

701
01:42:00.634 --> 01:42:03.307
helpful. Not that we would do that, but I just find it. I

702
01:42:03.308 --> 01:42:05.264
don't know maybe something happened years ago and this made

703
01:42:05.264 --> 01:42:06.578
sense, but I don't know what it is.

704
01:42:06.578 --> 01:42:11.454
Item 12 is crossed off and then item 13. So we just leaving

705
01:42:11.454 --> 01:42:13.967
item 12 empty. Are we going to Wren numerate the items on

706
01:42:13.968 --> 01:42:15.208
that page?

707
01:42:15.918 --> 01:42:17.428
Um

708
01:42:17.638 --> 01:42:22.010
Correct. Do you love 12 13 will become 12 and 14 will

709
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:23.888
become 13. Um.

710
01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:32.108
I had I had actually got a couple of

711
01:42:33.918 --> 01:42:38.494
can you explain um, we've had some instances where we've

712
01:42:38.494 --> 01:42:40.828
had elections between

713
01:42:41.238 --> 01:42:45.118
regularly scheduled State elections and I believe there's

714
01:42:45.118 --> 01:42:48.838
been a change to some of that information in terms of when

715
01:42:48.838 --> 01:42:51.871
we are required to if we have to have a special election

716
01:42:51.871 --> 01:42:56.622
because of some of the dates required by Ed code when in

717
01:42:56.623 --> 01:43:00.118
fact that election is required to be combined with a

718
01:43:00.118 --> 01:43:03.178
regularly scheduled election, we've had instances where

719
01:43:03.178 --> 01:43:05.210
things like that occur in the aligned with the spring

720
01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:08.757
election, that could be normally scheduled by the county.

721
01:43:08.758 --> 01:43:12.058
But when it occurs in 1 of these very strange places where

722
01:43:12.058 --> 01:43:15.718
it's after like November not close this spring.

723
01:43:15.718 --> 01:43:19.988
I find it very confusing to read all of these if when but

724
01:43:19.988 --> 01:43:22.718
type of paragraphs, maybe it's just like a chart.

725
01:43:22.918 --> 01:43:28.605
And then lastly, well, I I I think really what would happen

726
01:43:28.605 --> 01:43:32.117
is we were confirmed with the county and legal council on

727
01:43:32.118 --> 01:43:35.594
the timing and what that cost would be and whether we can

728
01:43:35.594 --> 01:43:39.998
join an existing or upcoming election or we would have to

729
01:43:39.998 --> 01:43:43.915
hold 1 just simply ourselves. So I don't think as your

730
01:43:43.915 --> 01:43:46.152
superintendent. I wouldn't make that recommendation to the

731
01:43:46.152 --> 01:43:48.997
board to make that call without us confirming with the

732
01:43:48.998 --> 01:43:52.646
County Register of Voters and our legal counsel. So Under

733
01:43:52.646 --> 01:43:53.018
The Heading of

734
01:43:53.018 --> 01:43:55.615
Timelines for family and vacancy could be add something to

735
01:43:55.615 --> 01:43:57.877
that first sentence that just declares that we would

736
01:43:57.877 --> 01:43:59.784
coordinate that with the county.

737
01:44:01.065 --> 01:44:03.736
Because otherwise, I have no problem with the lower

738
01:44:03.736 --> 01:44:05.822
paragraphs because I don't have to worry about the county

739
01:44:05.822 --> 01:44:06.954
is going to kind of tell us.

740
01:44:06.955 --> 01:44:10.375
Sure, that makes sense. Um

741
01:44:16.155 --> 01:44:21.135
So the eligibility requirements for appointment, um is also

742
01:44:21.135 --> 01:44:24.571
at the county level. So is there are we restating that

743
01:44:24.571 --> 01:44:28.127
information in the next item below number 3 there on that

744
01:44:28.127 --> 01:44:29.034
page?

745
01:44:29.035 --> 01:44:30.135
Are we?

746
01:44:30.135 --> 01:44:33.145
Are we basically copying what the county has on its

747
01:44:33.145 --> 01:44:35.995
documents? Are we creating our own set? And the that's why

748
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.345
I brought the other point of.

749
01:44:37.385 --> 01:44:40.025
Is it possible that we could coordinate with the county or

750
01:44:40.025 --> 01:44:42.495
just reference their site?

751
01:44:42.495 --> 01:44:45.095
So that we're not duplicating any information especially if

752
01:44:45.095 --> 01:44:47.705
they for whatever reason updated. I don't know why.

753
01:44:47.705 --> 01:44:51.645
Are you talking about if the for the resolution for the

754
01:44:51.645 --> 01:44:57.045
board to um choose a candidate know I'm looking at the

755
01:44:57.045 --> 01:45:00.105
eligibility for appointment. Um, I guess

756
01:45:00.105 --> 01:45:03.175
okay, maybe I'm confused when we qualify someone the very

757
01:45:03.175 --> 01:45:05.965
last line sentence that we were talking about earlier kind

758
01:45:05.965 --> 01:45:09.115
of curtails into under the words eligibility for

759
01:45:09.115 --> 01:45:12.595
appointment it the county actually States the parameters by

760
01:45:12.595 --> 01:45:15.646
which anyone can run for various offices whether it's state

761
01:45:15.646 --> 01:45:20.082
or local and so it would be either helpful if we reference

762
01:45:20.083 --> 01:45:22.575
their information or if we just restate what they put on

763
01:45:22.575 --> 01:45:23.005
their site.

764
01:45:23.305 --> 01:45:25.947
Then we wouldn't have to include it in the last sentence. I

765
01:45:25.947 --> 01:45:26.524
think.

766
01:45:29.435 --> 01:45:32.955
Again, isn't that what you asked me to look into for the

767
01:45:32.955 --> 01:45:34.785
resolution to be more specific?

768
01:45:34.935 --> 01:45:37.825
Of the yes, okay.

769
01:45:38.575 --> 01:45:41.627
But you could do it up here instead of in that section down

770
01:45:41.627 --> 01:45:43.415
there if you want to that's all.

771
01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:47.005
Um, I think that's all the

772
01:45:47.005 --> 01:45:50.659
comments I have from this sheet if I have any other ones

773
01:45:50.659 --> 01:45:53.149
all 4 of them to you. Thank you. All right. Thank you. I'll

774
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:55.170
bring it back, uh at the next board meeting for a second

775
01:45:55.171 --> 01:45:59.965
read. I have 1 clear question. Just checking. Um, it's says

776
01:46:00.615 --> 01:46:04.135
for the appointment it would be until the next election. So

777
01:46:04.135 --> 01:46:07.903
if we appointed someone for Area 3, would that be a 2-year

778
01:46:07.903 --> 01:46:08.815
term then it'd be a

779
01:46:10.205 --> 01:46:13.965
I'm sorry. My mic wasn't on it would be a 2 year term.

780
01:46:13.965 --> 01:46:16.185
Okay, good. Thank you. I didn't realize that. So that's

781
01:46:16.185 --> 01:46:18.765
important clarification clarification because I know when

782
01:46:18.765 --> 01:46:21.645
you were appointed it was until the next election which was

783
01:46:21.645 --> 01:46:25.665
off cycle of when and then you ran at that election. So it

784
01:46:25.665 --> 01:46:28.275
would technically be a 2-year term until the next.

785
01:46:28.593 --> 01:46:30.853
election cycle

786
01:46:30.853 --> 01:46:34.643
that is how I read filling a vacancy.

787
01:46:34.643 --> 01:46:37.733
Right, and that's why all that would be in the resolution.

788
01:46:37.733 --> 01:46:42.353
So everyone is clear on, um, the criteria for running and

789
01:46:42.353 --> 01:46:44.543
the length of the term of that appointment.

790
01:46:44.783 --> 01:46:47.733
Can I ask the question though?

791
01:46:48.403 --> 01:46:52.583
If the county were to run 1 of their elections in the

792
01:46:52.583 --> 01:46:53.213
spring.

793
01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:58.525
Would that require us to move that election to the spring

794
01:46:58.526 --> 01:47:01.593
or we actually really do carry the full 2 terms because the

795
01:47:01.593 --> 01:47:03.993
appointments for 2 terms. So the appointment dictates it

796
01:47:03.993 --> 01:47:07.507
for 2 terms. Where is it? Just until the next I mean, sorry

797
01:47:07.507 --> 01:47:10.926
2 years or is it literally until the next election whenever

798
01:47:10.927 --> 01:47:13.719
that occurs it says to the next regularly scheduled

799
01:47:13.719 --> 01:47:15.513
election for that office.

800
01:47:15.513 --> 01:47:19.443
So that office so that would be when?

801
01:47:19.693 --> 01:47:22.043
2 and 5 are up.

802
01:47:22.043 --> 01:47:25.108
But that could be 4 years if it's the regularly scheduled

803
01:47:25.108 --> 01:47:29.013
election for that office. I would consider all of these

804
01:47:29.013 --> 01:47:30.533
that office.

805
01:47:30.533 --> 01:47:33.893
I think that's what we did. Correct and it's every 2 years

806
01:47:33.893 --> 01:47:37.433
every 2 years. We we elect we're on the regular cycle.

807
01:47:42.773 --> 01:47:44.553
very good

808
01:47:44.743 --> 01:47:48.143
doesn't need clarification that the appointment if it were

809
01:47:48.143 --> 01:47:49.283
to occur is

810
01:47:50.533 --> 01:47:53.273
2 years, I mean not to

811
01:47:53.273 --> 01:47:56.113
the well, okay. No, never mind. I was thinking do we need

812
01:47:56.113 --> 01:47:59.243
to put verbage in there? So folks are not confused at all.

813
01:47:59.243 --> 01:48:03.155
Like hey, if I'm appointed I can step down in November of

814
01:48:03.155 --> 01:48:05.803
the same year. Well, we'll put that we would put that in

815
01:48:05.803 --> 01:48:10.235
the resolution prior to the application window. So everyone

816
01:48:10.235 --> 01:48:13.543
will know what the criteria is to apply right what the

817
01:48:13.543 --> 01:48:16.663
process is to be appointed and what the length of the term

818
01:48:16.663 --> 01:48:18.743
will be. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

819
01:48:20.893 --> 01:48:25.043
Okay, so those will both come back for second readings.

820
01:48:25.043 --> 01:48:27.553
Next meeting, correct?

821
01:48:27.553 --> 01:48:29.623
That is correct. Okay.

822
01:48:29.623 --> 01:48:32.263
Um next we have another.

823
01:48:32.263 --> 01:48:33.753
first reading

824
01:48:33.753 --> 01:48:37.823
um board policy on AI

825
01:48:39.433 --> 01:48:43.517
Yeah, this is exciting. Um, I want to introduce. Well,

826
01:48:43.517 --> 01:48:45.893
first of all, thank you president Palm superintendent Funk

827
01:48:45.893 --> 01:48:48.533
and Board of Trustees and members of the community. I

828
01:48:48.533 --> 01:48:51.029
wanted to interview Steve while they are chief technology

829
01:48:51.029 --> 01:48:53.573
officer as he's approaching. I just want to say some nice

830
01:48:53.573 --> 01:48:56.518
things about him and his leadership on on this particular

831
01:48:56.519 --> 01:48:57.983
board policy.

832
01:48:57.983 --> 01:49:02.079
Uh typically as you heard, uh, Mr. Funk earlier today is

833
01:49:02.079 --> 01:49:05.583
that we get our recommendations from csba.

834
01:49:05.583 --> 01:49:10.538
well, um, we are ahead of csba and most districts and so we

835
01:49:10.538 --> 01:49:14.198
are on The Cutting Edge Dublin is on The Cutting Edge of of

836
01:49:14.198 --> 01:49:17.558
this policy and it's largely as a result of um,

837
01:49:17.558 --> 01:49:20.378
superintendent funks leadership and and Dave's and so just

838
01:49:20.378 --> 01:49:22.588
want to uh, say a nice things about Dave. He's done a nice

839
01:49:22.588 --> 01:49:24.998
job of leading his group to Dave valdi.

840
01:49:27.858 --> 01:49:30.808
I better go well s***.

841
01:49:31.048 --> 01:49:35.388
Good evening, uh president felm superintendent Funk Board

842
01:49:35.388 --> 01:49:38.648
of Trustees and executive cabinet. Um,

843
01:49:38.648 --> 01:49:41.648
Like Matt said tonight, I bring uh the first reading of a

844
01:49:41.648 --> 01:49:46.268
board Pol of board policy and administrative regulation

845
01:49:46.268 --> 01:49:49.298
0444 0.1 artificial intelligence.

846
01:49:49.348 --> 01:49:53.498
What you see here, uh before you as a culmination of work

847
01:49:53.498 --> 01:49:57.698
by the technology advisory committee's AI sub uh committee.

848
01:49:57.698 --> 01:50:00.938
Uh with the assistance of in code Justice, which is led by

849
01:50:00.938 --> 01:50:03.248
our own, uh diksha.

850
01:50:03.248 --> 01:50:05.438
gladon, and I

851
01:50:05.438 --> 01:50:08.918
and I'm very excited about this policy and are not because

852
01:50:08.918 --> 01:50:13.088
it's Earth shattering, but it goes beyond the

853
01:50:13.088 --> 01:50:18.228
typical resolution or exhibit and really sets down just a

854
01:50:18.228 --> 01:50:20.808
quite policy, uh that we can follow.

855
01:50:20.808 --> 01:50:24.778
And with all dis, uh Technology based policies. We know

856
01:50:24.778 --> 01:50:26.978
that this 1 will be under regular review.

857
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.338
Uh to capture changes in artificial intelligence and how it

858
01:50:32.338 --> 01:50:35.158
is used within education and the work environment and how

859
01:50:35.158 --> 01:50:36.958
it affects learning outcomes.

860
01:50:36.958 --> 01:50:40.232
So this is the first reading of a long line of first

861
01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:43.056
readings tonight, and I'm here to take comments and answer

862
01:50:43.056 --> 01:50:45.448
questions as we move forward towards the second reading.

863
01:50:48.818 --> 01:50:50.568
trustee blacken

864
01:50:50.568 --> 01:50:53.318
Thank you so much for bringing this forward and for the

865
01:50:53.318 --> 01:50:55.858
amount of work. It takes to develop something from scratch.

866
01:50:55.858 --> 01:50:59.978
I know it's challenging and definitely appreciate it. Um

867
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.574
A couple things. I I understand that we're trying to um, at

868
01:51:04.574 --> 01:51:08.078
least hammer out something that is both Broad and flexible.

869
01:51:08.078 --> 01:51:12.638
But also well defined the 1 thing I will point out is like

870
01:51:12.638 --> 01:51:17.498
in the are. Um, I was reading in some cases we talked about

871
01:51:17.498 --> 01:51:20.618
what students can can't do should shouldn't do but 1 of the

872
01:51:20.618 --> 01:51:22.418
things we didn't talk about something we worked really hard

873
01:51:22.418 --> 01:51:24.578
with our grading policy is trying to create a level of

874
01:51:24.578 --> 01:51:28.298
uniformity between teachers working in the same subject

875
01:51:28.298 --> 01:51:32.318
areas. So if you're teaching let's say history and it's all

876
01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:35.018
all these student classes and all these teachers that the

877
01:51:35.018 --> 01:51:38.618
level and ability for students from the same course with

878
01:51:38.618 --> 01:51:42.773
different teachers to use access those tools should be

879
01:51:42.773 --> 01:51:45.796
uniform in some way. So that 1 student group doesn't have

880
01:51:45.797 --> 01:51:49.043
the same project and somebody gets to use AI for half of it

881
01:51:49.043 --> 01:51:50.768
and somebody gets to use AI for none of it.

882
01:51:50.768 --> 01:51:54.234
Again, these help students in some ways, but we need to make

883
01:51:54.235 --> 01:51:59.575
it somewhat fair and reasonable across um these groups.

884
01:51:59.575 --> 01:52:01.982
So I I hope that's clear enough and I didn't necessarily

885
01:52:01.983 --> 01:52:05.245
see that in here. Um, no, we could tie that in with the

886
01:52:05.245 --> 01:52:07.105
wording that we've used with the grading policy for

887
01:52:07.105 --> 01:52:09.805
collaboration. That would be great in certain subjects.

888
01:52:09.805 --> 01:52:12.105
Yeah, and in some ways that maybe this is part of that

889
01:52:12.105 --> 01:52:15.025
discussion since it does inform the ability for students to

890
01:52:15.025 --> 01:52:18.625
represent their ideas and to be graded for them. But um not

891
01:52:18.625 --> 01:52:21.655
touching on that point. But um, I was curious about how do

892
01:52:21.655 --> 01:52:24.145
we really know? How do we really test? How do we really

893
01:52:24.145 --> 01:52:29.865
define whether or not a student has used AI to as you noted

894
01:52:29.865 --> 01:52:34.405
in the are rephrase rewrite more than 50% 15% of their

895
01:52:34.405 --> 01:52:37.315
writing because it is possible for students to use an AI

896
01:52:37.315 --> 01:52:40.600
platform. And then to retype the entirety of it into

897
01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:44.085
another document without you or anyone else being able to

898
01:52:44.085 --> 01:52:46.975
trace that. In fact that was generated from AI. So how are

899
01:52:46.975 --> 01:52:49.825
we actually tracking the some of the parameters we've set

900
01:52:49.825 --> 01:52:53.305
for students to be able to limit their rely Reliance on it.

901
01:52:53.305 --> 01:52:55.705
Well, and that is the difficult part of AI and I think

902
01:52:55.705 --> 01:52:58.816
that's what frustrates teachers the most is how do I catch

903
01:52:58.817 --> 01:52:59.605
it? And

904
01:52:59.605 --> 01:53:02.045
Some ways like we know certain students are using it. How

905
01:53:02.045 --> 01:53:05.915
do I catch it? And a lot of the time it is that very how do

906
01:53:05.915 --> 01:53:10.187
you say robotics style of writing and also where words that

907
01:53:10.187 --> 01:53:14.685
AI uses don't really fit into in the context. They seem

908
01:53:14.685 --> 01:53:16.403
like the right word, but they're not contextually the right

909
01:53:16.403 --> 01:53:20.735
word for a student who's trying to write eloquently. Um,

910
01:53:20.735 --> 01:53:24.912
And uh, so yes, there are ways if I was to take something

911
01:53:24.912 --> 01:53:28.844
from chat GPT, and I was to put it into Coral Bots and then

912
01:53:28.845 --> 01:53:31.125
I was to put it through grammarly. I might come out with

913
01:53:31.158 --> 01:53:34.285
something entirely different or if I was to rewrite the

914
01:53:34.285 --> 01:53:37.845
idea. Yes, but I think it's for the teacher who is

915
01:53:37.845 --> 01:53:39.525
reviewing. Um,

916
01:53:39.525 --> 01:53:41.815
the the finished work

917
01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:45.005
to see that it is it is.

918
01:53:45.005 --> 01:53:48.515
Is this within the students? Um

919
01:53:48.515 --> 01:53:51.575
this is in the students like

920
01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:54.755
educational level wording level. Is it something that they

921
01:53:54.755 --> 01:53:57.895
would turn in and that's it's really when we look at

922
01:53:57.895 --> 01:53:59.705
teaching.

923
01:53:59.705 --> 01:54:04.365
uh and like signing works like taking profound ideas or

924
01:54:04.365 --> 01:54:08.933
quoting or things like that as a teacher teachers can see.

925
01:54:08.934 --> 01:54:11.205
Okay. This is not your work. This is obviously not your

926
01:54:11.205 --> 01:54:13.665
thought or I've heard this thought somewhere else and it

927
01:54:13.665 --> 01:54:17.625
needs to be quoted. We need to add AI into that that that

928
01:54:17.625 --> 01:54:22.965
talk of of when we're quoting books and periodicals and

929
01:54:22.965 --> 01:54:25.665
magazines and speeches and things like that AI needs to be

930
01:54:25.665 --> 01:54:28.665
part of that because that's the same kind of style of

931
01:54:28.665 --> 01:54:30.621
teacher when they're grading. They're going to see that

932
01:54:30.621 --> 01:54:34.185
this is not the student's profound work with a 15% It's

933
01:54:34.185 --> 01:54:36.165
something we went back and forth on a little bit with our

934
01:54:36.165 --> 01:54:39.705
committee in terms of like how do you really judge 15% and

935
01:54:39.705 --> 01:54:42.885
we went with well a number of words things like that. We we

936
01:54:42.885 --> 01:54:45.485
stayed with 15% but that's something we're flexible with in

937
01:54:45.485 --> 01:54:46.725
terms of rewarding.

938
01:54:46.736 --> 01:54:49.236
So I appreciate that because I think that's going to be the

939
01:54:49.236 --> 01:54:50.966
biggest challenge here. But 1 Thing also would be to look

940
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.567
at I know in some cases you can look at the speed at which

941
01:54:54.567 --> 01:54:57.733
a student inputs information how fast they write and create

942
01:54:57.733 --> 01:55:01.895
is an indication of it not being generated in Earnest. Um,

943
01:55:01.896 --> 01:55:04.176
so anyways, I know you'll be struggling with that and I

944
01:55:04.176 --> 01:55:07.296
just was curious about it. Um, I understand that we already

945
01:55:07.296 --> 01:55:10.536
use some of these you included, uh, grammar punctuation. So

946
01:55:10.536 --> 01:55:13.056
are we now putting the things that we use in like word and

947
01:55:13.056 --> 01:55:16.236
other platforms that just do grammar checks as being in AI

948
01:55:16.236 --> 01:55:18.156
even though we've all been essentially I assume everybody's

949
01:55:18.156 --> 01:55:21.696
been using that those for a long time. We're checks in the

950
01:55:21.696 --> 01:55:23.406
systems like that is is

951
01:55:23.406 --> 01:55:26.836
typical use it it is kind of what we would call walled AI

952
01:55:26.836 --> 01:55:29.930
which it's it's it's um artificial intelligence that's

953
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:32.415
generated before in a specific use and Rule with

954
01:55:32.416 --> 01:55:35.356
punctuation being that way. Um,

955
01:55:35.776 --> 01:55:40.076
uh, is that part of the 15% The only reason why I ask is

956
01:55:40.076 --> 01:55:42.556
we're all guilty of the of using that so that would wipe

957
01:55:42.556 --> 01:55:45.656
out almost anything anybody uses to try and check spelling.

958
01:55:45.736 --> 01:55:49.772
They may write out this entire thing after we know uh, I

959
01:55:49.772 --> 01:55:51.806
didn't do that but I just was like thinking like we all use

960
01:55:51.806 --> 01:55:55.856
it. So, where's the what's in the 15% what when you I guess

961
01:55:55.856 --> 01:55:58.136
I would like a little bit more information on the 15% so

962
01:55:58.136 --> 01:56:01.136
well and I think what we're looking at 15% is is the the

963
01:56:01.136 --> 01:56:05.276
actual writing and ideas that go into um the work not

964
01:56:05.276 --> 01:56:07.724
necessarily the grammar but that is important when we talk

965
01:56:07.724 --> 01:56:10.482
about eloquent writing when we talk about uh in English

966
01:56:10.483 --> 01:56:14.216
that students use proper grammar and punctuation. But um, I

967
01:56:14.216 --> 01:56:16.706
think it's more towards the actual thought.

968
01:56:16.706 --> 01:56:19.166
and actual ideal

969
01:56:19.166 --> 01:56:21.456
process that goes into writing

970
01:56:21.456 --> 01:56:25.106
so when we look at the policy itself, and I appreciate the

971
01:56:25.106 --> 01:56:27.026
amount of work that went into it. I will share 1 thing. I

972
01:56:27.026 --> 01:56:30.026
would love it if we could actually write a paragraph for a

973
01:56:30.026 --> 01:56:31.988
piece that talks about and I sort of wrote my own little

974
01:56:31.989 --> 01:56:35.546
thing that says how families are essentially a component of

975
01:56:35.546 --> 01:56:38.786
the support structure that helps students. They work with

976
01:56:38.786 --> 01:56:41.266
us. They're part of that group that basically supports as

977
01:56:41.266 --> 01:56:43.268
soon as they're learning along the way not in the

978
01:56:43.269 --> 01:56:46.466
classroom, but some way that actually Embraces the fact

979
01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:48.866
that they're Partners in overseeing their students use of

980
01:56:48.866 --> 01:56:52.986
AI at home and to that extent we would need to educate them

981
01:56:52.986 --> 01:56:55.886
a little bit about what platforms what AI tools and other

982
01:56:55.886 --> 01:56:59.426
things we actually would request they kind of check in and

983
01:56:59.426 --> 01:57:01.601
ensure that their student isn't taking full advantage of it

984
01:57:01.601 --> 01:57:03.926
because I think if you leave a child onto their own without

985
01:57:03.926 --> 01:57:06.878
any oversight at home, how are you ever going to know that

986
01:57:06.878 --> 01:57:09.986
makes your job harder, but if you could add a piece that at

987
01:57:09.986 --> 01:57:14.306
least tries to broaden who this is addressing to bring the

988
01:57:14.306 --> 01:57:18.446
parents in as partners with us and ensuring that I AI is an

989
01:57:18.446 --> 01:57:21.386
abused when the students are working at home on projects

990
01:57:21.386 --> 01:57:21.476
and

991
01:57:21.476 --> 01:57:25.113
Things I think that would be nice trusty Blackman. Are you

992
01:57:25.114 --> 01:57:28.084
suggesting that in the policy or the are that's I would

993
01:57:28.084 --> 01:57:31.024
like I would like that in the policy because then it sets

994
01:57:31.024 --> 01:57:34.540
that it's a board in a bigger picture that we acknowledge

995
01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:38.254
that parents are a partner with us in this issue. If you

996
01:57:38.254 --> 01:57:40.744
want to put the specifics of it in the are that's fine, but

997
01:57:40.744 --> 01:57:43.144
I think it'd be nice to have it in the board policy.

998
01:57:43.144 --> 01:57:46.554
And um, maybe some parameters about it. Um,

999
01:57:46.554 --> 01:57:49.276
1 of the things that I'm finding that we need a lot more

1000
01:57:49.276 --> 01:57:52.384
work on is we have a lot of tools they're rolling out and

1001
01:57:52.384 --> 01:57:54.664
for students whose maybe parents and others.

1002
01:57:54.664 --> 01:57:59.094
Have a bit more Tech background. They might be more fossil

1003
01:57:59.094 --> 01:58:03.429
and I was wondering with inviting showing demonstrating

1004
01:58:03.429 --> 01:58:06.744
their children to these platforms and tools rather soon as

1005
01:58:06.744 --> 01:58:09.364
they don't so is there going to be some sort of training or

1006
01:58:09.364 --> 01:58:12.844
some sort of like we're going to introduce you to these

1007
01:58:12.844 --> 01:58:15.864
tools. They're for you can manage it. Is there something

1008
01:58:15.864 --> 01:58:18.804
that's going to be included where we take more control over

1009
01:58:18.804 --> 01:58:20.694
what tools we will

1010
01:58:20.694 --> 01:58:23.974
show you how to properly use or we just assuming we're

1011
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.474
going to police students with whatever tool they come up

1012
01:58:26.474 --> 01:58:30.716
with. Well, I think to first start in terms of the family

1013
01:58:30.716 --> 01:58:33.142
and terms of the r would think we would look at something

1014
01:58:33.143 --> 01:58:36.033
in the training and professional development area and being

1015
01:58:36.034 --> 01:58:39.414
hosting family information. Is that might provide that area

1016
01:58:39.414 --> 01:58:42.814
in the are to cover also the for policy change, but I think

1017
01:58:42.814 --> 01:58:46.204
what we would be doing and it is in the um,

1018
01:58:46.494 --> 01:58:50.944
the IT department and also in um

1019
01:58:50.944 --> 01:58:54.624
is that we would be um

1020
01:58:55.304 --> 01:58:58.524
And I think it's also in the professional development that

1021
01:58:58.524 --> 01:59:01.674
we would be um coming up with.

1022
01:59:01.674 --> 01:59:06.864
Training for certain AI usages within the classroom. So we

1023
01:59:06.864 --> 01:59:10.152
look at something like magic bus, which is a fantastic

1024
01:59:10.152 --> 01:59:12.984
website. It's all AI driven for teachers to build rubrics

1025
01:59:12.984 --> 01:59:15.794
and things like that. So we've already started and done

1026
01:59:15.794 --> 01:59:18.024
some training with that kind of with those kinds of

1027
01:59:18.024 --> 01:59:22.704
products to assist teachers, but this would also be um,

1028
01:59:22.704 --> 01:59:25.982
looking at different kinds of platforms that are out there

1029
01:59:25.982 --> 01:59:29.163
that students would be using and training students and also

1030
01:59:29.164 --> 01:59:32.104
we could be offering a a family night or something where we

1031
01:59:32.104 --> 01:59:36.324
could provide that to families as well about how they're

1032
01:59:36.324 --> 01:59:39.186
used what they can use because 1 of these things is 1 of

1033
01:59:39.187 --> 01:59:43.284
our in our R is ALS making sure that the teacher

1034
01:59:43.284 --> 01:59:46.918
Uh differentiates what AI tools they're allowed to use

1035
01:59:46.918 --> 01:59:49.816
within their assignments. And so for them to have a good

1036
01:59:49.817 --> 01:59:51.874
broad range and training on each of them that's going to be

1037
01:59:51.874 --> 01:59:55.294
very important and that's something that it and c and I

1038
01:59:55.294 --> 01:59:57.724
will be working together with to provide.

1039
01:59:59.461 --> 02:00:02.081
Thank you for clarifying that really helps because I was

1040
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:05.981
just curious like where the road starts and ends on this.

1041
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.761
Um, I don't really know if a lot of the companies are

1042
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:13.481
developing AI have ever considered doing a roll out just

1043
02:00:13.481 --> 02:00:16.781
for schools that would provide a platform that you could

1044
02:00:16.781 --> 02:00:18.401
actually manage.

1045
02:00:18.401 --> 02:00:20.971
Through the platform both the students access you could

1046
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.211
look at whether it's 15% but also to put some parameters on

1047
02:00:24.211 --> 02:00:27.651
timeliness and use right now. It's a free-for-all but it's

1048
02:00:27.651 --> 02:00:30.771
possible that they might be interested in something that

1049
02:00:30.771 --> 02:00:33.756
would give them a better Avenue working with younger

1050
02:00:33.756 --> 02:00:37.911
people. Um 1 of the questions. I also had was there was a

1051
02:00:37.911 --> 02:00:40.011
series of statements in here, and I know that this is

1052
02:00:40.011 --> 02:00:43.356
really hard to for some people but AI has been criticized

1053
02:00:43.356 --> 02:00:46.971
for a while with how you know, garbage and garbage out.

1054
02:00:46.971 --> 02:00:48.831
Sometimes the information comes in. It's just using the

1055
02:00:48.831 --> 02:00:51.486
data that's out there and and we all know when we see it

1056
02:00:51.486 --> 02:00:54.771
sort of thing, but when we use terms in the documents that

1057
02:00:54.771 --> 02:00:57.831
we talk about bias, I think a lot of times the

1058
02:00:57.831 --> 02:01:01.431
The automatic go to is maybe something other than what the

1059
02:01:01.431 --> 02:01:05.151
intent is and so finding a word that talks about the

1060
02:01:05.151 --> 02:01:10.391
inaccuracy of the output of the AI to describe how data

1061
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:14.151
sometimes doesn't result in most accurate output might be a

1062
02:01:14.151 --> 02:01:17.091
better way of disseminating the fact that there's a lot of

1063
02:01:17.091 --> 02:01:20.871
false information and the limitations of the AI model. Um,

1064
02:01:20.871 --> 02:01:23.031
I just don't want to get mixed up with some of the other

1065
02:01:23.031 --> 02:01:25.251
comments that have occurred with the problems with the

1066
02:01:25.251 --> 02:01:27.681
recent and we've all seen it online with

1067
02:01:27.681 --> 02:01:29.738
AI but thank you very much for bringing this forward. I

1068
02:01:29.738 --> 02:01:31.490
think it's a great start and I

1069
02:01:31.491 --> 02:01:34.501
I hope it works so, too. Thank you.

1070
02:01:36.271 --> 02:01:40.451
I just had 1 thing and it's uh, it's up on the screen. It's

1071
02:01:40.451 --> 02:01:44.861
the third paragraph and it's just the policy. Yes. Um, it's

1072
02:01:44.861 --> 02:01:47.351
just a terminology you're talking about how students and

1073
02:01:47.351 --> 02:01:50.411
Educators must remain the center of Education. Um, and this

1074
02:01:50.411 --> 02:01:52.871
is an evidence-based AI technology must enhance the

1075
02:01:52.871 --> 02:01:55.271
educational experience and I there's something about the

1076
02:01:55.271 --> 02:01:57.851
word must to me because there's times when it doesn't so I

1077
02:01:57.851 --> 02:02:01.391
just think the word may is is just the way it reads is like

1078
02:02:01.391 --> 02:02:03.611
it must be a part of everything and it's going to enhance

1079
02:02:03.611 --> 02:02:07.301
it versus just it may enhance it when appropriate. Okay?

1080
02:02:07.301 --> 02:02:08.651
Yeah, absolutely.

1081
02:02:11.811 --> 02:02:15.528
Well, and that is the idea of shallow shallow, you know

1082
02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:18.300
will you know, we're definitely not forcing.

1083
02:02:18.301 --> 02:02:21.951
Teachers to use AI if they you know, they don't feel it's

1084
02:02:21.951 --> 02:02:23.631
necessary or when there's classrooms there. It doesn't make

1085
02:02:23.631 --> 02:02:27.411
sense. So we can't say yeah, you have to have a Impe I mean

1086
02:02:27.411 --> 02:02:29.871
because it's in every class. But yes if they want to

1087
02:02:29.871 --> 02:02:30.501
definitely

1088
02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:35.098
um Tracy vishwani, that's 20

1089
02:02:35.148 --> 02:02:38.174
I just wanted to say I'm really glad this is being brought

1090
02:02:38.175 --> 02:02:40.528
forward because being a high school student, of course,

1091
02:02:40.528 --> 02:02:44.068
I've seen with other students how and with teachers and

1092
02:02:44.068 --> 02:02:47.448
parents. Actually there can be like a there's a signal on

1093
02:02:47.448 --> 02:02:49.888
AI that it's like either something really bad for students

1094
02:02:49.888 --> 02:02:53.668
to use and what this policy it kind of makes it that they

1095
02:02:53.668 --> 02:02:56.248
can learn how to use it. Right and it's just I just want to

1096
02:02:56.248 --> 02:02:58.168
say thank you for bringing this forward because it will

1097
02:02:58.168 --> 02:03:01.198
help like the educational system a lot. Thank you.

1098
02:03:02.648 --> 02:03:06.678
All right. Thank you. I think I have a few things and then

1099
02:03:06.678 --> 02:03:09.160
this will come back next meeting as well. Yes next week.

1100
02:03:09.161 --> 02:03:12.198
All righty. Thank you. Thank you to your committee and our

1101
02:03:12.198 --> 02:03:14.758
great students who have been a big part of this and helping

1102
02:03:14.758 --> 02:03:18.168
move us move us forward. Absolutely. Thank you.

1103
02:03:21.018 --> 02:03:24.208
Alrighty, next up we have.

1104
02:03:24.208 --> 02:03:26.128
a lot of HR

1105
02:03:36.818 --> 02:03:39.318
Yes, we do.

1106
02:03:39.318 --> 02:03:40.398
um

1107
02:03:41.058 --> 02:03:44.518
All of the items that were bringing forward tonight for our

1108
02:03:44.518 --> 02:03:48.766
first reading, um, many of them relate to generalities

1109
02:03:48.766 --> 02:03:52.138
around safety and notifying employees of policies that

1110
02:03:52.138 --> 02:03:57.418
relate to that. Um, so the first 1 that we have is k1 and

1111
02:03:57.418 --> 02:04:00.478
the policy is related to employee notifications.

1112
02:04:00.478 --> 02:04:04.278
And you'll see that we're bringing forward an update.

1113
02:04:04.278 --> 02:04:09.548
and also 2 aars that are being recommended um to resend

1114
02:04:09.768 --> 02:04:13.972
can I answer any questions about this first reading on this

1115
02:04:13.972 --> 02:04:15.208
policy?

1116
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.968
um any questions, I mean

1117
02:04:30.968 --> 02:04:33.748
I feel like I've read a lot of these on the other side as

1118
02:04:33.748 --> 02:04:34.948
well. So

1119
02:04:38.248 --> 02:04:41.588
Okay.

1120
02:04:41.588 --> 02:04:44.268
And I think all right is everything tonight. First reading

1121
02:04:44.268 --> 02:04:46.945
is on all these? Yes. Okay. Yes it is so we can just kind

1122
02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:49.593
of go through and talk. Yes people have questions related

1123
02:04:49.593 --> 02:04:51.228
to specific ones.

1124
02:04:51.508 --> 02:04:53.078
mostly

1125
02:04:53.078 --> 02:04:56.745
item K2 is also a first reading of board policies related

1126
02:04:56.746 --> 02:05:01.508
to employee safety. Um, the BPS are updated and then new

1127
02:05:01.508 --> 02:05:04.358
administrative regulations a company them.

1128
02:05:04.358 --> 02:05:09.363
And um again, I I can answer any questions that you have

1129
02:05:09.364 --> 02:05:14.424
essentially, um this policy update relates to as I've

1130
02:05:14.424 --> 02:05:17.124
indicated in the background a recent Senate bill that was

1131
02:05:17.124 --> 02:05:21.120
passed. Um that supports an implementation of a workplace

1132
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:24.984
violence prevention plan, which we have completed and is up

1133
02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:28.095
on the website and the requirements related to that policy

1134
02:05:28.095 --> 02:05:29.993
are currently in motion.

1135
02:05:30.594 --> 02:05:33.844
We're very happy about that. It was a large project.

1136
02:05:34.154 --> 02:05:36.174
trustee backman

1137
02:05:36.174 --> 02:05:39.668
I thank you for bringing this forward. I just had a couple

1138
02:05:39.668 --> 02:05:42.974
comments and I'll just use the first 1.

1139
02:05:42.974 --> 02:05:47.334
I think it's 4157. It's through all kind of similar. Um

1140
02:05:47.334 --> 02:05:50.244
when we talk about the first paragraph. Um,

1141
02:05:50.244 --> 02:05:53.914
In terms of the second sentence working conditions and

1142
02:05:53.914 --> 02:05:57.854
Equipment shall be shall comply with standards prescribed

1143
02:05:57.854 --> 02:06:00.094
by federal state local laws and regulations. I don't

1144
02:06:00.094 --> 02:06:03.466
actually think that equipment I don't think it sounds

1145
02:06:03.466 --> 02:06:05.974
strange to say equipment but perhaps it's the use or

1146
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.234
maintenance of equipment.

1147
02:06:07.234 --> 02:06:11.029
That we're talking about. Um as opposed to the equip. I

1148
02:06:11.029 --> 02:06:13.087
don't think we would buy equipment that didn't meet Federal

1149
02:06:13.087 --> 02:06:15.603
standards, but it might be the how we're

1150
02:06:15.604 --> 02:06:19.556
Maintaining it. Um, sure. Yeah, I can take a look at the

1151
02:06:19.556 --> 02:06:20.564
way that that

1152
02:06:20.564 --> 02:06:24.094
Sounds when when it's um phrased that way, thank you.

1153
02:06:24.094 --> 02:06:25.924
Thanks and then um

1154
02:06:26.524 --> 02:06:29.804
the I think it's the

1155
02:06:31.544 --> 02:06:34.434
all employees. There's a paragraph couple further down all

1156
02:06:34.434 --> 02:06:38.244
employees are expected to Safe work practices. Um,

1157
02:06:38.254 --> 02:06:41.834
we took out the in the sentence in the paragraph like 2

1158
02:06:41.834 --> 02:06:44.984
paragraphs before the board. It says the board expects.

1159
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.679
We remove the board expect. Um, so I was just curious why

1160
02:06:48.679 --> 02:06:51.904
if this is word policy.

1161
02:06:52.274 --> 02:06:56.004
or we removing the board expects just because

1162
02:06:56.234 --> 02:06:59.314
I don't know what I was just curious. It seems like the

1163
02:06:59.314 --> 02:07:01.944
only change is really something really to that statement.

1164
02:07:01.944 --> 02:07:06.034
Um, and then I went down to

1165
02:07:06.034 --> 02:07:08.854
um, there's a paragraph the superintendent or designee

1166
02:07:08.854 --> 02:07:11.974
shall make first aid materials readily available and I

1167
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.034
thought about this paragraph and some of the the paragraph

1168
02:07:15.034 --> 02:07:17.614
that was crossed off before talking about I protected

1169
02:07:17.614 --> 02:07:20.794
devices. So when we talk about first aid materials a lot of

1170
02:07:20.794 --> 02:07:23.344
times that's like eyewash stations Band-Aids other things

1171
02:07:23.344 --> 02:07:26.794
that deal with as an after effect, but I thought some of

1172
02:07:26.794 --> 02:07:30.574
what was in the paragraph before was really protective and

1173
02:07:30.574 --> 02:07:34.294
safety devices and AIDS, but when we cross off the

1174
02:07:34.294 --> 02:07:36.874
paragraph in pink before we don't really have anything that

1175
02:07:36.874 --> 02:07:38.464
talks about the fact that we have

1176
02:07:38.464 --> 02:07:43.564
Provided these truly like protection safety devices and AIDS

1177
02:07:43.564 --> 02:07:45.868
throughout our facilities like in case there's an incident

1178
02:07:45.868 --> 02:07:48.724
and I thought we need to include that somewhere in here. I

1179
02:07:48.724 --> 02:07:50.704
know it's maybe not part of

1180
02:07:50.704 --> 02:07:53.304
some code piece, but I thought we should probably at least

1181
02:07:53.304 --> 02:07:56.064
make that statement that we would make those.

1182
02:07:56.184 --> 02:07:59.224
Safety elements available then. It's great that we have the

1183
02:07:59.224 --> 02:08:01.324
afterthought the first aid pieces there in case something

1184
02:08:01.324 --> 02:08:02.464
goes wrong, but

1185
02:08:02.464 --> 02:08:06.104
Um, okay. I think the goggles especially but anyways, those

1186
02:08:06.104 --> 02:08:07.964
are my own my only comments. Thank you.

1187
02:08:08.174 --> 02:08:11.334
Thank you. Yeah, I'll take a look at the way that's worded

1188
02:08:11.334 --> 02:08:13.494
so that it's um more clear.

1189
02:08:13.494 --> 02:08:15.934
I I understand what you're saying.

1190
02:08:20.244 --> 02:08:25.264
Any other questions on this 1 and these are like the the 3

1191
02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:30.814
like it's for correct certificated and and Leadership. Yes.

1192
02:08:30.814 --> 02:08:32.584
figuring out those patterns

1193
02:08:32.944 --> 02:08:39.029
All righty, and the next 1 is yeah K3. Um, thank you. So

1194
02:08:39.029 --> 02:08:43.324
this is again a first reading and relates to updated board

1195
02:08:43.324 --> 02:08:46.364
board policies for policies. We always have already have an

1196
02:08:46.364 --> 02:08:49.904
effect for employees with infectious disease and in the

1197
02:08:49.904 --> 02:08:54.710
background, I've given um some explanation primarily. This

1198
02:08:54.711 --> 02:08:56.900
is just to make sure that we're updated with language

1199
02:08:56.900 --> 02:09:02.684
around ADI Ada and fiha and 504 language. Um, and it adds

1200
02:09:02.684 --> 02:09:05.864
additional language included with those that might be

1201
02:09:05.864 --> 02:09:08.444
infected with diseases such as HIV.

1202
02:09:08.444 --> 02:09:10.244
AIDS and hepatitis

1203
02:09:12.684 --> 02:09:16.792
C Blackman, thank you for presenting this I just a couple

1204
02:09:16.792 --> 02:09:19.494
quick questions. So on the paragraph where we talk about

1205
02:09:19.494 --> 02:09:22.324
that the super it's at the bottom pretty much but um of the

1206
02:09:22.324 --> 02:09:24.664
first page the superintendent of design shall immediately

1207
02:09:24.664 --> 02:09:27.514
report to local Health officer the presence or suspected

1208
02:09:27.514 --> 02:09:31.864
presence of a etc. It's a disease. I I often looked at some

1209
02:09:31.864 --> 02:09:33.844
of this information thought well, how do you know because

1210
02:09:33.844 --> 02:09:36.574
we have individual HEPA protections where unless that

1211
02:09:36.574 --> 02:09:40.384
individual disclose is something how would we ever know to

1212
02:09:40.384 --> 02:09:43.429
be able to provide that information to a county or local

1213
02:09:43.429 --> 02:09:44.794
Health officer?

1214
02:09:45.174 --> 02:09:49.474
Without the employer individual on site disclosing it and

1215
02:09:49.474 --> 02:09:51.934
then they would have to do they disclose it to us or I

1216
02:09:51.934 --> 02:09:53.662
don't understand the process where we've ever come into

1217
02:09:53.662 --> 02:09:54.754
that information.

1218
02:09:55.194 --> 02:09:59.356
Are you referring to the red line the language that struck

1219
02:09:59.357 --> 02:10:02.470
out know the language that's in there's a paragraph that

1220
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:05.174
just talks how the superintendent didn't show immediately

1221
02:10:05.174 --> 02:10:07.894
report. Yeah to the local Health officer the presence of or

1222
02:10:07.894 --> 02:10:11.194
suspected presence of this, but I'm not really clear on.

1223
02:10:11.194 --> 02:10:14.194
How do we come about that information throughout some of

1224
02:10:14.194 --> 02:10:18.322
this I actually was looking for things like where are our

1225
02:10:18.322 --> 02:10:20.224
where individuals um

1226
02:10:20.224 --> 02:10:24.070
Health um proxies where where is their health protected here

1227
02:10:24.071 --> 02:10:27.035
where how do we acquire that information without violating

1228
02:10:27.035 --> 02:10:28.475
their privacy?

1229
02:10:29.935 --> 02:10:34.247
Well, I think that the language while it may not seem

1230
02:10:34.247 --> 02:10:37.795
clear. I believe it it is clear that the superintendent

1231
02:10:37.795 --> 02:10:40.145
shall report it when and if they know.

1232
02:10:40.145 --> 02:10:43.325
So they may not know that someone has a communicable

1233
02:10:43.325 --> 02:10:47.435
disease. However, if we become aware or if a school nurse

1234
02:10:47.435 --> 02:10:49.817
or any other health, um Health official in the district

1235
02:10:49.817 --> 02:10:53.535
becomes aware of or we know about it. Then the obligation

1236
02:10:53.535 --> 02:10:58.475
to report is in play So you you're correct that um, for

1237
02:10:58.475 --> 02:11:01.370
example, when we're processing a leave request or a request

1238
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:04.535
for accommodation, we may know that the employee has a

1239
02:11:04.535 --> 02:11:07.025
medical condition, but we can't require that. They tell us

1240
02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:11.495
what the condition is. Um, but I would add to that that

1241
02:11:11.495 --> 02:11:14.925
within our rights we are able to ask for more information

1242
02:11:14.925 --> 02:11:18.515
from a physician as long as we're not asking them to

1243
02:11:18.515 --> 02:11:21.515
disclose confidential information and occasionally through

1244
02:11:21.515 --> 02:11:23.855
the questionnaires that we're allowed to give to

1245
02:11:23.855 --> 02:11:27.095
Physicians. They provide us with additional detail that

1246
02:11:27.095 --> 02:11:30.035
that's more over important around deciding whether or not

1247
02:11:30.035 --> 02:11:33.335
we can reasonably accommodate not because we're looking to

1248
02:11:33.335 --> 02:11:36.815
have something to report. Um, but sometimes it relates to

1249
02:11:36.815 --> 02:11:39.995
that as well. Yeah, I understand that especially with

1250
02:11:39.995 --> 02:11:40.385
leaves and other

1251
02:11:40.385 --> 02:11:44.105
Things where there's a wall of privacy from the information,

1252
02:11:44.105 --> 02:11:47.465
but in here there's obviously some sort of evidence of a

1253
02:11:47.465 --> 02:11:50.945
disease or presence of 1 that causes you to report it. So

1254
02:11:50.945 --> 02:11:54.365
I'm just wondering how we actually come upon those facts

1255
02:11:54.365 --> 02:11:57.765
when most of that information is highly protected. Yeah, I

1256
02:11:57.765 --> 02:12:02.225
guess I would say it depends but only by doing it legally.

1257
02:12:02.225 --> 02:12:04.615
doing it legally. So if the employee makes us aware or

1258
02:12:04.615 --> 02:12:07.730
otherwise, but we wouldn't attempt to get that information,

1259
02:12:07.730 --> 02:12:11.645
um without doing so in a protective and legal way.

1260
02:12:11.645 --> 02:12:14.803
So the other comment that I want to make is that we do have

1261
02:12:14.803 --> 02:12:17.065
the county health officers which during coid that provide a

1262
02:12:17.065 --> 02:12:19.900
lot of updates and information. So would we be inputting

1263
02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:22.405
some statement in here about the fact that we wouldn't be

1264
02:12:22.405 --> 02:12:25.415
making a lot of these decisions about how to manage these

1265
02:12:25.415 --> 02:12:28.300
outbreaks we'd be working with them on protocols and things

1266
02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:32.215
that we would need to do or we bringing I'm assuming we're

1267
02:12:32.215 --> 02:12:35.395
not relying on our nurse our district nurse to make those

1268
02:12:35.395 --> 02:12:38.875
decisions. But are we involving the county health officer

1269
02:12:38.875 --> 02:12:42.535
or some other agency to come in and work with us on how we

1270
02:12:42.535 --> 02:12:46.315
mitigate that if there's any kind of spread? Yes. Okay, and

1271
02:12:46.315 --> 02:12:48.847
that stated somewhere in here because I didn't really see

1272
02:12:48.847 --> 02:12:52.475
much. Well, I think I think the reference that's in there

1273
02:12:52.475 --> 02:12:55.195
relates to the California code that requires the list of

1274
02:12:55.195 --> 02:12:59.635
items that we have to report and um within that

1275
02:12:59.635 --> 02:13:03.235
additionally yes, we would consult with them. I think the

1276
02:13:03.235 --> 02:13:07.675
most present example for all of us would be around Co 19

1277
02:13:07.675 --> 02:13:10.345
and all of the interactions that we had with the county.

1278
02:13:10.345 --> 02:13:14.741
While we were monitoring and tracking, um coid which was 1

1279
02:13:14.741 --> 02:13:17.537
infected. We had a lot of action around.

1280
02:13:17.787 --> 02:13:21.427
Yeah, as I was going to jump in and say that that's what

1281
02:13:21.427 --> 02:13:24.727
this reminded me of that we would report to the county and

1282
02:13:24.727 --> 02:13:27.432
if you were taking leave because you had covid then you

1283
02:13:27.433 --> 02:13:29.362
would tell that that's why you're taking leave. And so then

1284
02:13:29.362 --> 02:13:31.837
you would know and then we had to report to the county.

1285
02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:35.007
Employee stuff. So I I assume it's it's something to that

1286
02:13:35.007 --> 02:13:38.207
effect where we're having to collect information like that

1287
02:13:38.207 --> 02:13:41.677
and report it and then and you'll see policies related to

1288
02:13:41.677 --> 02:13:44.257
students because more often than not because we have more

1289
02:13:44.257 --> 02:13:46.897
students together. They may bring a communicable disease to

1290
02:13:46.897 --> 02:13:49.717
school and there's guidelines around how we report those as

1291
02:13:49.717 --> 02:13:50.377
well.

1292
02:13:50.377 --> 02:13:53.865
So for a follow-up question then is so this is primarily

1293
02:13:53.865 --> 02:13:59.097
more common communicable diseases as opposed to like

1294
02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:02.457
infectious diseases where you would actually have like a

1295
02:14:02.457 --> 02:14:06.317
I don't know like an emergency. Um, it just seems like it's

1296
02:14:06.317 --> 02:14:08.037
more like things that we can deal with at the medical

1297
02:14:08.037 --> 02:14:11.657
level. Not the sort of severe like, you know Contagion.

1298
02:14:11.657 --> 02:14:15.707
Yeah, I would have to I would have to bring the list up in

1299
02:14:15.707 --> 02:14:18.907
order to tell you for sure. But I think the policy clearly

1300
02:14:18.907 --> 02:14:22.387
indicates that it's a communicable infectious disease and

1301
02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:25.147
then we follow the guidelines that were required to around

1302
02:14:25.147 --> 02:14:27.667
what is in the list that we have to report.

1303
02:14:28.417 --> 02:14:31.127
Thank you very much. You're welcome.

1304
02:14:33.417 --> 02:14:37.117
Any other questions on?

1305
02:14:39.737 --> 02:14:44.307
4119 if not, then we'll go on to

1306
02:14:44.307 --> 02:14:46.577
0411 19.42

1307
02:14:46.577 --> 02:14:49.647
Bloodborne pathogens everyone's favorite beginning of the

1308
02:14:49.647 --> 02:14:53.217
year training. Yes. Yes. Yes. So the next item also

1309
02:14:53.217 --> 02:14:57.627
continuing around, um health and safety is in relation to

1310
02:14:57.627 --> 02:15:01.357
exposure control for bloodborne pathogens. Um, and also

1311
02:15:01.357 --> 02:15:05.847
makes reference to Hepatitis B, um, and this is again an

1312
02:15:05.847 --> 02:15:09.867
updated policy. Um, so we're just updating language that we

1313
02:15:09.867 --> 02:15:14.247
already had um to make it current and if I can answer any

1314
02:15:14.247 --> 02:15:15.477
questions, let me know.

1315
02:15:17.727 --> 02:15:21.547
Trustee Blackman. All right. So second to last paragraph.

1316
02:15:21.547 --> 02:15:25.187
we're talking about identifying an employee that has an

1317
02:15:25.187 --> 02:15:28.642
occupational exposure. So in other words already exposed

1318
02:15:28.642 --> 02:15:31.267
and yet we're talking about training and then also then

1319
02:15:31.267 --> 02:15:34.027
putting them in a vaccination program, but this seems like

1320
02:15:34.027 --> 02:15:35.707
this is after the

1321
02:15:35.877 --> 02:15:39.877
The horses of the barn sort of thing where where it's

1322
02:15:39.877 --> 02:15:42.897
already happened. So is this really preventative or is this

1323
02:15:42.897 --> 02:15:44.707
after the fact

1324
02:15:44.707 --> 02:15:47.072
I was trying to understand it like because it sounds like

1325
02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:48.527
the person's already been exposed.

1326
02:15:48.527 --> 02:15:53.231
Correct. Um, so it relates primarily to around when we know

1327
02:15:53.231 --> 02:15:57.211
there's been an exposure incident. Um, and also you're

1328
02:15:57.211 --> 02:15:59.851
right that there is training that is involved in this and

1329
02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:02.911
then there's a form that employees can turn in to request

1330
02:16:02.911 --> 02:16:08.071
um being vaccinated for Hepatitis B, and that's actually um

1331
02:16:08.071 --> 02:16:11.271
a piece of this policy that we're currently working on

1332
02:16:11.271 --> 02:16:12.451
implementing.

1333
02:16:12.921 --> 02:16:16.561
We want to do the training and the vaccination before the

1334
02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:17.521
exposure.

1335
02:16:21.091 --> 02:16:23.591
Well, um.

1336
02:16:23.651 --> 02:16:27.891
I I can't say for sure whether we should do it beforehand.

1337
02:16:27.891 --> 02:16:31.191
Uh, the policy talks about this policy is in related to

1338
02:16:31.191 --> 02:16:35.751
exposure control plan. So, um, some of the things that are

1339
02:16:35.751 --> 02:16:38.871
included in this policy relate to things as you mentioned

1340
02:16:38.871 --> 02:16:42.051
at the beginning that we've already done training on and

1341
02:16:42.051 --> 02:16:45.051
that we continue to do training on so in the bloodborne

1342
02:16:45.051 --> 02:16:48.831
pathogen training that we do, um while I don't have it

1343
02:16:48.831 --> 02:16:52.011
fresh in my mind right now, I've recently watched it and it

1344
02:16:52.011 --> 02:16:55.053
does have a number of preventative tips and guidelines

1345
02:16:55.054 --> 02:16:58.251
provided in the training around how to prevent exposure.

1346
02:16:58.251 --> 02:17:01.071
And then again, I do think it's really important that it's

1347
02:17:01.071 --> 02:17:03.921
what do you do if in fact you become exposed

1348
02:17:07.231 --> 02:17:09.071
Thank you.

1349
02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:11.011
You're welcome.

1350
02:17:13.081 --> 02:17:15.731
All right. Any other questions on that 1?

1351
02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:21.171
All righty, um next 1 for universal precautions.

1352
02:17:21.441 --> 02:17:25.561
So we're on the theme of safety and precaution, um around

1353
02:17:25.561 --> 02:17:29.821
health and wellness. So this policy um isn't again an

1354
02:17:29.821 --> 02:17:33.061
updated policy around universal precautions. It is already

1355
02:17:33.061 --> 02:17:37.021
1 that we have in place and further extends language around

1356
02:17:37.021 --> 02:17:42.061
um, hepatitis and also, um language around AIDS or aides

1357
02:17:42.061 --> 02:17:45.271
related conditions. And again, it's just an update to make

1358
02:17:45.271 --> 02:17:47.881
sure that we're current and have new language related to

1359
02:17:47.881 --> 02:17:49.081
those things.

1360
02:17:49.081 --> 02:17:52.251
Can I answer any questions on this 1?

1361
02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:58.191
All right.

1362
02:17:58.191 --> 02:18:02.011
not seeing in and I'm assuming if for some reason someone

1363
02:18:02.011 --> 02:18:04.276
jumps on for public comment for any of these you'll let me

1364
02:18:04.276 --> 02:18:06.211
know, but I'm assuming

1365
02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:07.741
they're not.

1366
02:18:07.741 --> 02:18:10.743
And I do think trustee Blackman. This is a wonderful

1367
02:18:10.744 --> 02:18:13.341
partner to the last policy where you ask questions about

1368
02:18:13.341 --> 02:18:16.471
prevention. It talks a little bit about that here as well.

1369
02:18:18.421 --> 02:18:20.621
All righty.

1370
02:18:20.621 --> 02:18:22.941
Okay, um new topic. Yeah.

1371
02:18:22.942 --> 02:18:25.072
4111 yes.

1372
02:18:25.072 --> 02:18:28.659
Yeah this policy um near and dear to my heart around

1373
02:18:28.659 --> 02:18:32.521
Recruitment and selection and Human Resources. Um, first

1374
02:18:32.522 --> 02:18:35.722
readings on updo updated policies for Recruitment and

1375
02:18:35.722 --> 02:18:38.790
selection. If you look at the policy, um, you're going to

1376
02:18:38.791 --> 02:18:41.593
notice there's just some updated language around

1377
02:18:41.594 --> 02:18:45.562
discrimination, um how we hire and what procedures we use

1378
02:18:45.562 --> 02:18:49.522
to ensure that we're um, recruiting from a direct a diverse

1379
02:18:49.522 --> 02:18:51.262
pool of candidates.

1380
02:18:54.022 --> 02:18:56.462
May I answer any questions?

1381
02:18:59.472 --> 02:19:01.252
trustee Blackman

1382
02:19:01.252 --> 02:19:03.822
Thank you. I know this is a

1383
02:19:03.842 --> 02:19:08.772
a good stuff in here. Um, so my question was um,

1384
02:19:08.882 --> 02:19:13.615
when we we crossed out the item at the first sentence

1385
02:19:13.616 --> 02:19:17.802
saying the most holy High highly qualified replaced it with

1386
02:19:17.802 --> 02:19:18.962
suitable

1387
02:19:18.962 --> 02:19:21.182
Um, why?

1388
02:19:21.182 --> 02:19:24.162
Why wouldn't we want the most highly qualified individuals

1389
02:19:24.162 --> 02:19:26.022
for a position?

1390
02:19:26.022 --> 02:19:30.012
And how it is suitable best describe the most highly

1391
02:19:30.012 --> 02:19:33.252
qualified individual. I mean the reason why I asked if

1392
02:19:33.252 --> 02:19:35.067
somebody has 10 years of experience in their extraordinary

1393
02:19:35.067 --> 02:19:37.932
and somebody has 5 that and their extraordinary it seems

1394
02:19:37.932 --> 02:19:40.992
like we'd want the person with 10 years. But if we pick 5

1395
02:19:40.992 --> 02:19:43.692
would that be in the suitable category or would we I'm just

1396
02:19:43.692 --> 02:19:45.642
not understanding why we replace the verbiage.

1397
02:19:46.172 --> 02:19:49.592
Would you like us to take a look at that and consider if it

1398
02:19:49.632 --> 02:19:52.512
should remain in for the next reading qualified is in there

1399
02:19:52.512 --> 02:19:56.127
just right after and just say highly just as qualified. The

1400
02:19:56.127 --> 02:19:58.602
reason why I ask is that this morning at the

1401
02:19:58.602 --> 02:20:01.912
there was a lot of committee members outside Emerald when

1402
02:20:01.912 --> 02:20:04.122
it opened today and 1 of the things they were adamant about

1403
02:20:04.122 --> 02:20:07.984
is the level and quality of education. And I think it was

1404
02:20:07.984 --> 02:20:11.002
something that was just reiterated over and over again.

1405
02:20:11.002 --> 02:20:13.492
in their excitement of the new school opening and the

1406
02:20:13.492 --> 02:20:17.332
quality of education at Dublin, so it just seems like we

1407
02:20:17.332 --> 02:20:19.162
would still want to be

1408
02:20:19.162 --> 02:20:20.842
I think it's a goal.

1409
02:20:20.842 --> 02:20:24.302
Not that we always get but I think it's a good goal to have

1410
02:20:24.302 --> 02:20:25.072
okay.

1411
02:20:25.072 --> 02:20:30.032
all right, um couple things I want to ask is um,

1412
02:20:30.262 --> 02:20:33.002
We talked about.

1413
02:20:34.332 --> 02:20:38.632
Um trying to build greater. Maybe this is on the other 1.

1414
02:20:38.632 --> 02:20:39.622
Um

1415
02:20:39.622 --> 02:20:42.632
I might take some of this discussion offline but 1 of the

1416
02:20:42.632 --> 02:20:46.292
concerns I had was because I know that we're trying to

1417
02:20:46.292 --> 02:20:49.862
create greater diversity in our hires.

1418
02:20:49.862 --> 02:20:54.607
But as a board member we take an oath to the US

1419
02:20:54.607 --> 02:20:56.932
Constitution and to the Constitution of the State of

1420
02:20:56.932 --> 02:20:57.802
California.

1421
02:20:57.802 --> 02:21:01.337
That we are prevented from enacting or doing anything that

1422
02:21:01.338 --> 02:21:05.778
would create any imbalance or any impact negatively that

1423
02:21:05.778 --> 02:21:09.378
might be discerned as selecting somebody based on protected

1424
02:21:09.378 --> 02:21:10.218
class.

1425
02:21:10.218 --> 02:21:14.498
And so I caution us when we write some of our

1426
02:21:14.498 --> 02:21:17.528
policies with regard to Recruitment and selection that

1427
02:21:17.528 --> 02:21:19.748
might allude to it only because there's been a couple

1428
02:21:19.748 --> 02:21:21.128
recent cases.

1429
02:21:21.128 --> 02:21:24.268
In the United States that have basically changed the

1430
02:21:24.268 --> 02:21:29.248
interpretation of the Civil Rights Act and um Echo will

1431
02:21:29.248 --> 02:21:33.088
hiring practices and Etc. So I don't know if I necessarily

1432
02:21:33.088 --> 02:21:35.608
have the discussion here, but I do feel that we need to be

1433
02:21:35.608 --> 02:21:38.548
really careful about how we write some of this. I do

1434
02:21:38.548 --> 02:21:41.968
believe that as much as we can be neutral and focus merely

1435
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.748
on an individual's qualifications will probably be safe.

1436
02:21:45.748 --> 02:21:46.618
Um,

1437
02:21:46.618 --> 02:21:50.358
just fearful of what we do when we hire if we make any kind

1438
02:21:50.358 --> 02:21:52.338
of mistakes if it's subtle.

1439
02:21:52.338 --> 02:21:55.708
We will put ourselves in the long list of groups and

1440
02:21:55.708 --> 02:21:58.828
organizations that are basically in the line to head to the

1441
02:21:58.828 --> 02:22:01.288
federal courts, and I don't want us to be there. So if you

1442
02:22:01.288 --> 02:22:03.338
like to have a discussion separately, I'm happy to do that

1443
02:22:03.338 --> 02:22:04.348
later this week.

1444
02:22:04.378 --> 02:22:07.418
Thank you. We'll definitely take a look at that.

1445
02:22:10.208 --> 02:22:13.638
Any other questions or any other board members?

1446
02:22:14.208 --> 02:22:18.778
No, it will go on to bargaining units recognized employee

1447
02:22:18.778 --> 02:22:22.798
organizations. Thank you. Yes, um this again is an updated

1448
02:22:22.798 --> 02:22:26.848
board policy. There's also a new board policy. Um, and it's

1449
02:22:26.848 --> 02:22:29.428
around bargaining units and recognizing our employee

1450
02:22:29.428 --> 02:22:32.608
organizations. I think primarily what I would say about

1451
02:22:32.608 --> 02:22:35.428
this and it's fairly evident in the red line is that

1452
02:22:35.428 --> 02:22:38.728
there's just um, an abundance of additional language added

1453
02:22:38.818 --> 02:22:42.208
to provide Clarity around a number of things that I believe

1454
02:22:42.208 --> 02:22:45.455
were already doing, um, but to make very clear what those

1455
02:22:45.456 --> 02:22:46.468
things are.

1456
02:22:46.468 --> 02:22:49.718
And if I can answer questions, please let me know.

1457
02:22:50.938 --> 02:22:53.995
Jesse Buckman, can I just have you open the file? Because

1458
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.605
maybe I have an old file but my file actually shows the red

1459
02:22:56.606 --> 02:23:00.038
line 1 actually shows the same text repeated twice in the

1460
02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:02.348
document and I don't know if that was just an older version

1461
02:23:02.348 --> 02:23:07.658
it got updated on the red line. Yeah for 4140, uh for yeah,

1462
02:23:07.658 --> 02:23:10.478
4140. Yeah, because it states formation of bargaining units

1463
02:23:10.478 --> 02:23:13.163
and you go further down and then the membership and there's

1464
02:23:13.163 --> 02:23:16.718
formation of bargaining units again, so I was just I kept

1465
02:23:16.718 --> 02:23:18.686
thinking maybe there's some subtlety to it that I'm missing

1466
02:23:18.686 --> 02:23:20.843
and I read it again and it was like, it sounds a lot like

1467
02:23:20.843 --> 02:23:23.618
the stuff at the beginning. I'm not sure you might be

1468
02:23:23.618 --> 02:23:25.958
correct, but I do see a couple of differences, but I'll

1469
02:23:25.958 --> 02:23:27.878
make sure that I take a look at that. Yeah, that'd be

1470
02:23:27.878 --> 02:23:29.158
helpful because I didn't know what I'm supposed to be

1471
02:23:29.158 --> 02:23:31.898
reading if it's thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Yes,

1472
02:23:31.898 --> 02:23:35.158
definitely. I'll review it. It does look like it there are

1473
02:23:35.158 --> 02:23:36.608
some differences, but I'll be sure to

1474
02:23:36.608 --> 02:23:38.369
to check that carefully

1475
02:23:43.419 --> 02:23:46.099
All right any other questions otherwise?

1476
02:23:46.099 --> 02:23:48.509
So minor revisions and they'll come back.

1477
02:23:48.509 --> 02:23:50.309
next meeting

1478
02:23:50.749 --> 02:23:52.439
All righty.

1479
02:23:53.049 --> 02:23:57.169
Moving on it looks like we have a resolution. Um related to

1480
02:23:57.169 --> 02:23:58.609
Shamrock Hills.

1481
02:23:58.609 --> 02:24:00.179
and sea

1482
02:24:00.249 --> 02:24:02.089
and I see

02:24:22.139 --> 02:24:25.659
Finding no further environmental review is required for the

1488
02:24:25.659 --> 02:24:30.315
Shamrock Hills tk8 School pursuant to public resource code

1489
02:24:30.315 --> 02:24:35.479
21166 under the California Environmental Quality act. Uh,

1490
02:24:35.479 --> 02:24:38.679
there's a pretty extensive background here. Uh, but if you

1491
02:24:38.679 --> 02:24:41.739
have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

1492
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:51.046
I'm not seeing any questions. Do you have any public

1493
02:24:51.046 --> 02:24:52.048
comment on this 1?

1494
02:24:52.049 --> 02:24:53.669

1495
02:24:53.669 --> 02:24:56.903
There's no questions. I will take a motion to approve this

1496
02:24:56.903 --> 02:24:57.899
resolution.

1497
02:24:58.169 --> 02:25:04.119

1504
02:25:21.999 --> 02:25:23.932
Sorry, I almost called you by your first name and then I'm

1505
02:25:23.933 --> 02:25:25.709
like, nope, okay?

1506
02:25:25.709 --> 02:25:27.239
All righty.

1507
02:25:27.239 --> 02:25:28.599
That was easy.

1508
02:25:30.849 --> 02:25:37.429
Um next we are moving on to consent which is MN o p and Q.

1509
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:41.029
Is there anything anyone wishes to pull from consent?

1510
02:25:43.839 --> 02:25:45.799
trustee Blackman

1511
02:25:46.789 --> 02:25:49.853
don't want to pull something. I just want to thank somebody

1512
02:25:49.853 --> 02:25:52.169
for something and if I can't pull it then I can't thank

1513
02:25:52.169 --> 02:25:54.749
them. So do you want me to pull it or?

1514
02:25:55.119 --> 02:25:57.769
I would like to pull.

1515
02:25:57.769 --> 02:25:59.409
our 4

1516
02:26:05.599 --> 02:26:07.619
my apologies

1517
02:26:07.952 --> 02:26:10.932
So you'll still be able to comment when you get there?

1518
02:26:13.092 --> 02:26:14.932
an Opie and Q

1519
02:26:16.602 --> 02:26:22.822
I'll move that we approve the concent calendars and MN o p

1520
02:26:22.822 --> 02:26:23.602
and Q.

1521
02:26:23.872 --> 02:26:25.412
I'll second.

1522
02:26:25.412 --> 02:26:27.522
All righty. We have a motion in a second.

1523
02:26:27.522 --> 02:26:28.712
any other

1524
02:26:28.712 --> 02:26:30.012
Call for vote.

1525
02:26:30.012 --> 02:26:34.922
Um trustee pisani I everyone else. I I I passes

1526
02:26:34.922 --> 02:26:35.882
unanimously.

1527
02:26:35.882 --> 02:26:39.592
All righty, and then there are some written reports.

1528
02:26:39.592 --> 02:26:45.242
Um in our which are not um voted on but um, would you like

1529
02:26:45.242 --> 02:26:47.242
to trusty black? And would you like to make a comment on

1530
02:26:47.242 --> 02:26:49.712
our 4 and the Beautiful budget books?

1531
02:26:49.872 --> 02:26:53.782
And also our 2. I actually have a question about R2.

1532
02:26:53.782 --> 02:26:58.182
Okay going to start with R2 then so in R2 the agenda says

1533
02:26:58.182 --> 02:27:01.587
that csba directors at large comprised of only certain

1534
02:27:01.587 --> 02:27:03.012
categories.

1535
02:27:03.012 --> 02:27:06.672
Um, they're fairly limited has does anybody know if csba

1536
02:27:06.672 --> 02:27:08.202
ever thought about?

1537
02:27:08.202 --> 02:27:11.632
Doing away with these very bizarre sort of almost like

1538
02:27:11.632 --> 02:27:15.592
prescriptive ancient from like another era of views of how

1539
02:27:15.592 --> 02:27:18.982
we Define the different individuals who joined csba in

1540
02:27:18.982 --> 02:27:20.152
these positions.

1541
02:27:20.152 --> 02:27:23.446
Seems like it's I I just I'm looking at it. There's whole

1542
02:27:23.446 --> 02:27:26.036
groups of individuals who could participate that don't fit

1543
02:27:26.037 --> 02:27:28.752
in these categories and never would be able to and I've

1544
02:27:28.872 --> 02:27:31.524
ever wondered if anybody's ever written the directors and

1545
02:27:31.524 --> 02:27:34.225
said, you know, this is really a very old-fashioned way of

1546
02:27:34.225 --> 02:27:36.791
looking how we divide up a board.

1547
02:27:36.792 --> 02:27:39.540
Anybody from the Middle East for example would not be able

1548
02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:40.872
to participate.

1549
02:27:42.912 --> 02:27:46.422
I have not but you are welcome to reach out to them ahead

1550
02:27:46.422 --> 02:27:49.652
of the next csba. I think it might be something worthy of

1551
02:27:49.652 --> 02:27:52.402
discussion if they wanted to talk about it at the next.

1552
02:27:52.402 --> 02:27:56.372
Delegate assembly. Um, I know I don't think any of us have

1553
02:27:56.372 --> 02:27:59.702
been directly involved. Um, I think there are some local

1554
02:27:59.702 --> 02:28:00.932
Representatives.

1555
02:28:00.932 --> 02:28:03.052
um local trustees

1556
02:28:03.052 --> 02:28:06.752
in our area that are part of the delegate assembly that

1557
02:28:06.752 --> 02:28:08.882
maybe you want to get in touch with I think we

1558
02:28:08.882 --> 02:28:11.532
either voted on or didn't vote on some of them.

1559
02:28:11.532 --> 02:28:15.372
Yeah, we did very obscure as to who they are and where they

1560
02:28:15.372 --> 02:28:16.212
made it and

1561
02:28:16.212 --> 02:28:18.992
yeah, I'm sure we could find out who they are and maybe

1562
02:28:18.992 --> 02:28:22.042
get in touch with them about that'd be great. Thank you.

1563
02:28:23.212 --> 02:28:28.703
So if I can speak to our 4, I just want to thank um, Chris

1564
02:28:28.703 --> 02:28:31.411
Hobbs and his team for once again producing a really very

1565
02:28:31.412 --> 02:28:34.753
fine document. I think it's a superb piece of information

1566
02:28:34.753 --> 02:28:37.216
that really helps our community understand our budget

1567
02:28:37.217 --> 02:28:39.692
especially the year we've had on the year going forward

1568
02:28:39.692 --> 02:28:41.732
that this is really important and the fact that they make

1569
02:28:41.732 --> 02:28:44.564
it so understandable to the community big. Thank you to you

1570
02:28:44.564 --> 02:28:46.862
and your team for all the work that goes into this.

1571
02:28:49.834 --> 02:28:54.278
I will Echo that statement and we appreciate that. Um, and

1572
02:28:54.278 --> 02:28:57.158
I'm sure it will be something that we looked at often this

1573
02:28:57.158 --> 02:28:58.304
this uh,

1574
02:28:58.304 --> 02:28:59.614
this year

1575
02:28:59.614 --> 02:29:03.344
Um moving forward. Do we have anything people want to

1576
02:29:03.344 --> 02:29:06.428
request for future agendas now that we're kind of back back

1577
02:29:06.428 --> 02:29:07.754
in the swing of things.

1578
02:29:07.754 --> 02:29:11.044
items, um trustee spec and then trustee Blackman

1579
02:29:11.044 --> 02:29:15.044
Um, I'd like to hear back, um, and some of the things the

1580
02:29:15.044 --> 02:29:17.104
speakers talked about today. Um, I thought they brought up

1581
02:29:17.104 --> 02:29:20.324
some good points and um would love a follow-up on how we

1582
02:29:20.324 --> 02:29:22.724
can make sure we're encouraging Walkers and bikers at our

1583
02:29:22.724 --> 02:29:25.731
new high school. Um, this is the smallest the high school

1584
02:29:25.732 --> 02:29:29.024
will likely ever be and if the bike rack was full that is a

1585
02:29:29.024 --> 02:29:32.384
great sign, but also a sign we probably need to fix

1586
02:29:32.384 --> 02:29:33.314
something.

1587
02:29:33.314 --> 02:29:34.964
Thank you.

1588
02:29:36.084 --> 02:29:40.504
Thank you, and I'll second what trustee spec stated and in

1589
02:29:40.504 --> 02:29:43.834
addition. There are challenges. I think the speaker noted

1590
02:29:43.834 --> 02:29:47.644
it on pedestrian access to the site is very obscure and

1591
02:29:47.644 --> 02:29:50.128
Incredibly strange, so it would be great if we could look

1592
02:29:50.128 --> 02:29:51.454
at that. Um

1593
02:29:51.524 --> 02:29:54.564
in addition, I would appreciate it if we could actually

1594
02:29:54.564 --> 02:29:55.434
have

1595
02:29:55.434 --> 02:29:57.782
We've probably never done this but it'd be great if we

1596
02:29:57.782 --> 02:30:02.054
could have an update from the athletic departments, um for

1597
02:30:02.129 --> 02:30:05.219
our high schools like to get a better understanding about

1598
02:30:05.219 --> 02:30:08.354
how we're running those programs how we're offering things

1599
02:30:08.354 --> 02:30:11.707
safety information to students communication with parents

1600
02:30:11.708 --> 02:30:13.904
other things. I don't know if we have a really good grasp

1601
02:30:13.904 --> 02:30:16.844
of do we have policies that actually since we do have

1602
02:30:16.844 --> 02:30:20.240
Have 2 high schools. Now that ensure that we're actually

1603
02:30:20.276 --> 02:30:23.774
managing those pro programs in a manner that not that they

1604
02:30:23.774 --> 02:30:25.904
have to be the same program. But just something that gives

1605
02:30:25.904 --> 02:30:28.124
us a better idea that we're serving both students in a fair

1606
02:30:28.124 --> 02:30:29.084
and Equitable manner.

1607
02:30:30.214 --> 02:30:34.586
Can I also add the again what the speaker said but the

1608
02:30:34.586 --> 02:30:36.059
lights I just want to make sure we're being a good

1609
02:30:36.059 --> 02:30:39.854
neighbor, um over there. So making sure that someone is um

1610
02:30:39.854 --> 02:30:43.514
looking at the light situation and um if it is particularly

1611
02:30:43.514 --> 02:30:44.654
bright or

1612
02:30:45.674 --> 02:30:49.464
Well, we will certainly follow up regarding whether there

1613
02:30:49.464 --> 02:30:52.884
are specifically referring to the stadium and tennis court

1614
02:30:52.884 --> 02:30:57.654
lights or the lights surrounding the actual School itself.

1615
02:30:57.654 --> 02:30:58.494
Um

1616
02:30:58.494 --> 02:31:01.804
which is a much different conversation to have

1617
02:31:01.804 --> 02:31:04.234
Absolutely. I mean we we need to balance safety, but I just

1618
02:31:04.234 --> 02:31:08.014
want to make sure that you know, we take a look at it and

1619
02:31:08.014 --> 02:31:09.184
have made a

1620
02:31:09.784 --> 02:31:12.554
a decision, you know about it.

1621
02:31:13.044 --> 02:31:16.144
Trustee Blackman. I didn't want to forget we had a really

1622
02:31:16.144 --> 02:31:20.044
great presentation on AI but it brought up something that

1623
02:31:20.044 --> 02:31:23.044
made me realize that if we are incorporating new programs

1624
02:31:23.044 --> 02:31:25.594
in the district, it would be great. If we came back and

1625
02:31:25.594 --> 02:31:28.734
sort of have a very thorough discussion about how we

1626
02:31:28.734 --> 02:31:33.004
providing training so that when a student or a teacher are

1627
02:31:33.004 --> 02:31:36.244
basically asked or need to use a program or a platform

1628
02:31:36.244 --> 02:31:39.124
whether it's AI or something else that they actually have

1629
02:31:39.124 --> 02:31:43.189
the training because things are changing so quickly. I look

1630
02:31:43.189 --> 02:31:45.964
at our Equity policy. We may have students going into some

1631
02:31:45.964 --> 02:31:46.804
courses like

1632
02:31:46.804 --> 02:31:48.905
Whether it's at the middle school or the high school involve

1633
02:31:48.906 --> 02:31:51.606
other programs or platforms beyond the norm that they would

1634
02:31:51.606 --> 02:31:54.186
use for a course, but if we haven't provided them the

1635
02:31:54.186 --> 02:31:56.622
training to use those programs and platforms it puts them

1636
02:31:56.622 --> 02:31:59.826
in an incredible desiccate deficit. Sorry compared to other

1637
02:31:59.826 --> 02:32:01.710
students who may have for whatever reason their own

1638
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:04.146
personal lives come in contact with those platforms and be

1639
02:32:04.146 --> 02:32:08.346
ahead of the others in class. So I know we talked about AI

1640
02:32:08.346 --> 02:32:10.926
but also from the other point of view what platforms and

1641
02:32:10.926 --> 02:32:13.806
programs we're using if we could get a grasp of that and

1642
02:32:13.806 --> 02:32:15.666
ensure that we're not throwing things out at our students.

1643
02:32:15.666 --> 02:32:17.784
So if that's something we bring back to the board, that

1644
02:32:17.784 --> 02:32:21.036
would be very helpful if it's something we asked schools.

1645
02:32:21.036 --> 02:32:22.946
Just something to make sure that we're on the same page.

1646
02:32:22.946 --> 02:32:23.876
Thank you.

1647
02:32:27.876 --> 02:32:31.856
Okay, and I we can follow up on getting certain things on

1648
02:32:31.856 --> 02:32:35.056
agendas when we need to um 1 thing I would like everyone to

1649
02:32:35.056 --> 02:32:37.576
kind of note on the annual governance calendar as we're

1650
02:32:37.576 --> 02:32:41.249
starting is it does we do have listed all of our various

1651
02:32:41.249 --> 02:32:42.885
resolutions?

1652
02:32:42.886 --> 02:32:44.096
um

1653
02:32:44.096 --> 02:32:48.274
for the year, so maybe your homework before your next

1654
02:32:48.274 --> 02:32:52.072
1-on-1 is to like look that over make sure I know last year

1655
02:32:52.072 --> 02:32:53.746
there was a couple times that we felt like we missed

1656
02:32:53.746 --> 02:32:55.676
certain things. So let's if we can kind of look at that at

1657
02:32:55.676 --> 02:32:58.636
the beginning of the year. Um, so that we can make sure

1658
02:32:58.636 --> 02:33:02.926
that we're timely each month, um and getting those

1659
02:33:03.256 --> 02:33:05.846
those resolutions kind of

1660
02:33:05.846 --> 02:33:07.746
um ready to go.

1661
02:33:07.816 --> 02:33:12.056
Um, I think we've we've done a I mean there's so always so

1662
02:33:12.056 --> 02:33:13.830
many things we could do, but I think we've we've done a

1663
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:16.255
good job of of capturing a lot of the

1664
02:33:16.566 --> 02:33:20.288
Important key things um throughout the year, but I want to

1665
02:33:20.288 --> 02:33:22.701
make sure that everybody has a chance to look at that over

1666
02:33:22.702 --> 02:33:24.766
the before the next meeting.

1667
02:33:25.436 --> 02:33:29.333
Trustee spec another calendar item. Um, the superintendent

1668
02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:32.615
Council meetings. I believe we only went through the

1669
02:33:32.616 --> 02:33:35.710
spring. So, um, I don't know if there's going to be dates

1670
02:33:35.710 --> 02:33:39.215
for the fall and if you want to have a Siege pick 1 to

1671
02:33:39.216 --> 02:33:40.176

02:33:45.296 --> 02:33:47.276
like to um

1674
02:33:47.276 --> 02:33:50.546
Choose which month they would like to attend or you can

1675
02:33:50.546 --> 02:33:54.206
send me an email and I can say hey, we already have 1 or 2.

1676
02:33:54.206 --> 02:33:57.979

1677
02:33:57.979 --> 02:34:00.625

1678
02:34:00.626 --> 02:34:03.506
of the month depending on if there is a holiday.

1679
02:34:03.696 --> 02:34:06.136
Vacation and it'll start in septembar. Yes.

1680
02:34:08.066 --> 02:34:12.111
The first 1 is uh, september 13th. Well, I'll be glad to do

1681
02:34:12.111 --> 02:34:15.456
is send out the schedule for you and we'll put in a Google

1682
02:34:15.456 --> 02:34:18.426
doc. Uh, and then you can just put your name next to it and

1683
02:34:18.426 --> 02:34:20.556
know that no more than 2 can attend.

1684
02:34:21.948 --> 02:34:23.938
That would be great.

1685
02:34:23.938 --> 02:34:25.628
Thank you.

1686
02:34:25.628 --> 02:34:30.638
All righty, um that I think that brings us to trustee or

1687
02:34:30.638 --> 02:34:31.568
reports.

1688
02:34:32.928 --> 02:34:37.903
Um, yeah the great start of school. I um, I went to Murray

1689
02:34:37.903 --> 02:34:40.498
Elementary this morning. So welcome the kids. Um, they were

1690
02:34:40.498 --> 02:34:42.346
very excited and I appreciate the Murray Community

1691
02:34:42.346 --> 02:34:46.693
welcoming me. So my purple on from this morning, um, and uh

1692
02:34:46.693 --> 02:34:49.408
also great to see some of the construction going on school.

1693
02:34:49.408 --> 02:34:51.868
But um, ultimately the kids were really excited and the

1694
02:34:51.868 --> 02:34:54.928
parents, uh, lots of parents there walking their kids. Um,

1695
02:34:54.928 --> 02:34:58.618
and so just happy to start the school year again,

1696
02:35:00.368 --> 02:35:02.268
trustee Blackman

1697
02:35:02.268 --> 02:35:03.878
Hi, um.

1698
02:35:03.958 --> 02:35:07.598
Want to welcome everybody back to schools. It was an

1699
02:35:07.598 --> 02:35:11.738
awesome first day. I did spend my morning at Emerald. Um, I

1700
02:35:11.738 --> 02:35:14.018
know we had a lot of the community members there and media.

1701
02:35:14.018 --> 02:35:17.078
I avoided the media. I know you had that under control. Um,

1702
02:35:17.078 --> 02:35:19.010
it was wonderful talking to some of the community members

1703
02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:21.278
are very excited. The kids looked all happy the traffic was

1704
02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:24.878
a little crazy, but I want to say it was a really 1 of the

1705
02:35:24.878 --> 02:35:27.248
you put it down as your best day error after so many years

1706
02:35:27.248 --> 02:35:30.098
and seeing how happy the community was and how smoothly

1707
02:35:30.098 --> 02:35:32.858
that beginning of the day went into all the staff that made

1708
02:35:32.858 --> 02:35:35.918
opening our schools possible. Just want to thank you. It's

1709
02:35:35.918 --> 02:35:37.988
a lot of that hidden work that you do that makes things

1710
02:35:37.988 --> 02:35:40.838
work so well for our district and kudos to you for making

1711
02:35:40.838 --> 02:35:44.138
it go so well today. Um, I will point out 1 thing and 1

1712
02:35:44.138 --> 02:35:46.958
requests that came up that was probably um,

1713
02:35:46.958 --> 02:35:49.505
Very vocal from a lot of the students is we don't have

1714
02:35:49.506 --> 02:35:51.358
enough dining seating at the school.

1715
02:35:51.358 --> 02:35:55.258
It was 1 of the things that became dining seating at the

1716
02:35:55.258 --> 02:35:58.663
school. It became abundantly clear that students did not

1717
02:35:58.663 --> 02:36:02.110
have enough seating in the dining and may just be the way

1718
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:04.564
the dining is designed. But a lot of the students were

1719
02:36:04.565 --> 02:36:06.538
outside standing because there wasn't enough seating for

1720
02:36:06.538 --> 02:36:09.853
them. So if we could address that that would be wonderful.

1721
02:36:09.853 --> 02:36:12.459
Even if it's outside. Just they need more seating. Thank

1722
02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:12.748
you.

1723
02:36:14.308 --> 02:36:15.998
trustee cool

1724
02:36:15.998 --> 02:36:18.796
Yeah, so I just want to thank staff and all the teachers

1725
02:36:18.796 --> 02:36:22.378
and everyone out there that made today went as smoothly as

1726
02:36:22.378 --> 02:36:23.848
it did. Thank you.

1727
02:36:25.538 --> 02:36:29.218
Yes, and just reiterate that um, I know a lot went on

1728
02:36:29.218 --> 02:36:31.758
behind the scenes over the summer and the last few weeks in

1729
02:36:31.758 --> 02:36:33.378
particular. Um

1730
02:36:33.778 --> 02:36:36.518
I unfortunately was not able to be anywhere this morning.

1731
02:36:36.518 --> 02:36:39.428
Um other than getting my own kids draw kid kid kid kid

1732
02:36:39.428 --> 02:36:42.038
dropped off at school the first time I only had 1 in a very

1733
02:36:42.038 --> 02:36:44.858
long time here. Um and just

1734
02:36:44.858 --> 02:36:48.078
1 of the things I do love in working in education myself is

1735
02:36:48.078 --> 02:36:50.418
kind of the cyclical nature. There's always that first day

1736
02:36:50.418 --> 02:36:52.698
excitement. There's there's there's just something fun

1737
02:36:52.698 --> 02:36:55.458
about the first day of school and the new excitement and so

1738
02:36:55.458 --> 02:36:58.938
appreciating everything that went into planning over the

1739
02:36:58.938 --> 02:37:03.198
summer and all of those things. Um, and to to have the kids

1740
02:37:03.198 --> 02:37:04.368
back in the classroom.

1741
02:37:04.368 --> 02:37:07.844
Um, and so I think I know our facilities. I think that's

1742
02:37:07.845 --> 02:37:09.945
coming next meeting. I look forward to hearing all the

1743
02:37:09.945 --> 02:37:12.585
updates there. I know a lot of work has gone on over the

1744
02:37:12.585 --> 02:37:15.525
summer and it's really noticeable as I've walked by and

1745
02:37:15.525 --> 02:37:19.185
through campuses in the last few weeks. Um, so thank you to

1746
02:37:19.185 --> 02:37:21.705
all of you that have made that happen, um and to all of our

1747
02:37:21.705 --> 02:37:25.785
teachers for being here and welcoming. Um, oh actually 1

1748
02:37:25.785 --> 02:37:28.020
other thing I was able to welcome all of our new teachers

1749
02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:30.405
