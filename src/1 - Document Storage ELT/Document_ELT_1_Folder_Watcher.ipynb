        "Okay, let's dive into the first step: the **Directory Watcher** for Windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How the Directory Watcher Can Work on Windows**\n",
        "\n",
        "Windows offers a few mechanisms for monitoring file system changes, allowing us to implement a robust directory watcher. Here's a breakdown of the best options:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. `ReadDirectoryChangesW` API**\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   **Mechanism:** This is the most powerful and efficient way to monitor directory changes on Windows. It's a native Win32 API function that allows you to asynchronously receive notifications when changes occur within a directory (and optionally its subdirectories).\n",
        "   *   **Pros:**\n",
        "        *   **Event-Driven:** It operates on an event-driven model. Your watcher doesn't need to constantly poll the directory, making it very resource-efficient.\n",
        "        *   **Detailed Information:** The API provides detailed information about the changes, including the type of change (file added, deleted, modified, renamed), the filename, and the timestamps.\n",
        "        *   **Handles Overlapped I/O:** This enables highly efficient, asynchronous operations, minimizing blocking and improving performance.\n",
        "   *   **Cons:**\n",
        "        *   **Complexity:** It's a relatively low-level API, requiring you to manage buffers, handle overlapped structures, and deal with Win32 data types.\n",
        "        *   **Requires Native Code (or Wrapper):** You'll either need to write C/C++ code or use a Python library that wraps this API (more on this below).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. `FindFirstChangeNotification` API (Simpler, but Less Powerful)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   **Mechanism:** This is another Win32 API function that's easier to use than `ReadDirectoryChangesW`. It creates a handle that becomes signaled when a specified type of change occurs in a directory or its subtree.\n",
        "   *   **Pros:**\n",
        "        *   **Simpler to Use:** Compared to `ReadDirectoryChangesW`, it has a simpler interface.\n",
        "   *   **Cons:**\n",
        "        *   **Less Information:** You only get notified *that* a change happened, not *what* changed. You'll need to scan the directory to figure out the details.\n",
        "        *   **Can Miss Events:** In certain scenarios (especially with rapid changes), it might miss some events.\n",
        "        *   **Still Requires Polling (Sort Of):** Although it's event-based in the sense of being signaled, you still need to use a loop and `WaitForSingleObject` or `WaitForMultipleObjects` to wait for the signal and then resubmit a request to watch for further changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Python Libraries (Wrappers around `ReadDirectoryChangesW` or `FindFirstChangeNotification`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   **Mechanism:** These libraries provide a more Pythonic interface to the underlying Win32 API functions, simplifying the development process.\n",
        "   *   **Pros:**\n",
        "        *   **Easier Development:** They handle the low-level complexities of the Win32 API, letting you focus on the logic.\n",
        "   *   **Cons:**\n",
        "        *   **Dependency:** You'll need to install an additional library.\n",
        "        *   **Abstraction Overhead:** There might be a slight performance overhead compared to using the raw API directly, but usually negligible.\n",
        "   *   **Popular Options:**\n",
        "        *   **`watchdog`:** A very popular and well-maintained library that provides a cross-platform way to monitor file system events (it uses `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows).\n",
        "        *   **`pywin32`:**  This library provides access to many Win32 APIs, including `ReadDirectoryChangesW` and `FindFirstChangeNotification`, through a Python interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Polling (Not Recommended for Real-Time Monitoring)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   **Mechanism:** This involves repeatedly scanning the directory at regular intervals (e.g., every few seconds) and comparing the current state with the previous state to detect changes.\n",
        "   *   **Pros:**\n",
        "        *   **Simple to Implement:** It's relatively easy to write a basic polling loop using Python's `os.listdir()` or `os.scandir()`.\n",
        "   *   **Cons:**\n",
        "        *   **Inefficient:** It consumes resources even when no changes occur.\n",
        "        *   **Latency:** There's a delay between when a change happens and when your watcher detects it, proportional to the polling interval.\n",
        "        *   **Potential to Miss Events:** If changes happen rapidly between polling intervals, they might be missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation: `watchdog` (or `ReadDirectoryChangesW` if you need ultimate control)**\n",
        "\n",
        "For most cases, the **`watchdog`** library is the best choice. It offers a good balance of ease of use, efficiency, and reliability. It's actively maintained and handles the intricacies of `ReadDirectoryChangesW` under the hood.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you absolutely need the maximum possible performance and are comfortable dealing with low-level APIs, you could consider using `ReadDirectoryChangesW` directly via `pywin32`, but this adds complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Does it need to run on a schedule?**\n",
        "\n",
        "No, it **should not** run on a schedule in the traditional sense (like a cron job). It should be a **long-running process** that utilizes event-driven mechanisms (like those provided by `ReadDirectoryChangesW` or `watchdog`) to react to changes in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Does it need to keep track of existing files?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Initially, Yes:** When the Directory Watcher starts, it should ideally perform an initial scan of the directory to establish a baseline of existing files. This is to avoid treating all existing files as \"new\" when the watcher starts monitoring. This initial scan is a one time action per start of the watcher.\n",
        "*   **After Startup, No (Mostly):** Once the initial scan is complete, the event-driven mechanisms will notify the watcher of new files, modified files, and deleted files. The watcher itself doesn't need to actively maintain a list of files *in most cases*. It relies on the events it receives.\n",
        "*   **Edge Cases (Where Tracking Might Be Helpful):**\n",
        "    *   **Renames:** If you need to accurately track file renames, you might need to do some extra work, as the events you receive might be a \"delete\" followed by a \"create.\" You could potentially use file modification times or other heuristics to infer renames. Some libraries like `watchdog` provide a higher level event that detects renames.\n",
        "    *   **Missed Events (Rare):** In extremely rare cases of missed events, a periodic background check (not a full scan) might be a safety net, but this shouldn't be the primary mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How will it treat differently new files from changed existing ones?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The events generated by `ReadDirectoryChangesW` (and consequently by `watchdog`) distinguish between different types of changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`FILE_ACTION_ADDED`:**  Indicates a new file was created in the directory.\n",
        "*   **`FILE_ACTION_MODIFIED`:** Indicates an existing file's content was modified.\n",
        "*   **`FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_OLD_NAME` and `FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME`**: Used to identify file renames.\n",
        "*   `FILE_ACTION_REMOVED`: Indicates a file was deleted from the directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Directory Watcher's event handler will receive these events and can then take different actions:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **New Files (`FILE_ACTION_ADDED`):**\n",
        "    1.  Create a new `Document` object.\n",
        "    2.  Populate initial metadata.\n",
        "    3.  Pass the `Document` to the `ExtractorFactory`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Changed Files (`FILE_ACTION_MODIFIED`):**\n",
        "    1.  You might need to check if you already have a `Document` object representing this file (this could involve a lookup mechanism, perhaps using the file path as a key).\n",
        "    2.  If you have an existing `Document`, update its content and relevant metadata. This means you need to re-extract the content and update the metadata using `Extractor`. This also means the `Extractor` needs to support updating an existing `Document`.\n",
        "    3.  If you don't have a corresponding `Document` (which should be rare if you're tracking properly), treat it as a new file.\n",
        "\n",
