Sure, let's create a strategy file that outlines the best approach to learn from your collection of documents. This file will serve as a guide for developing individual functions and files within your `1_prelearning` experiment. Here's the strategy:

# Strategy for Document Processing and Knowledge Extraction

## Overview

The goal is to process a collection of school board documents to extract valuable information and build a knowledge graph. The documents vary in format and content, including agendas, meeting minutes, and transcripts. This strategy outlines the steps to process these documents, extract entities and relationships, and construct a knowledge graph for further analysis.

## Steps

### 1. Document Ingestion

- **Objective**: Read documents from 

raw_documents

 and prepare them for processing.
- **Actions**:
  - Identify and list all document files in the 

raw_documents

 folder.
  - Support various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) by converting them to plain text.

### 2. Text Preprocessing

- **Objective**: Clean and normalize text data for better extraction results.
- **Actions**:
  - Remove unnecessary whitespace, special characters, and formatting.
  - Normalize text (e.g., lowercasing, removing stop words if necessary).

### 3. Entity Extraction

- **Objective**: Identify and extract key entities from the text.
- **Entities to Extract**:
  - **Participants**: Names and roles (e.g., board members, teachers, parents).
  - **Events**: Occurrences such as presentations and resolutions.
  - **Topics**: Subjects discussed during meetings.

- **Actions**:
  - Use NLP libraries (e.g., `spaCy`) to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER).
  - Create a list of entities with their types and attributes.

### 4. Relationship Extraction

- **Objective**: Determine relationships between entities.
- **Actions**:
  - Analyze sentences to find connections between participants, events, and topics.
  - Use dependency parsing and pattern matching to identify relationships.

### 5. Data Structuring

- **Objective**: Organize extracted data into structured formats.
- **Actions**:
  - Define data classes (

BoardMeeting

, 

Participant

, 

Event

, 

Topic

).
  - Populate instances of these classes with extracted data.
  - Serialize structured data to JSON or another suitable format.

### 6. Knowledge Graph Construction

- **Objective**: Build a knowledge graph from structured data.
- **Actions**:
  - Use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store entities and relationships.
  - Define node and relationship types consistent with the data classes.
  - Populate the graph database with the structured data.

### 7. Iterative Refinement

- **Objective**: Continuously improve the extraction and processing pipeline.
- **Actions**:
  - Evaluate the accuracy of entity and relationship extraction.
  - Refine preprocessing and extraction methods based on observed results.
  - Update the pipeline to handle edge cases and improve performance.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Document Ingestion Script

- **File**: `src/step1_read_documents.py`
- **Function**: `run()`
- **Description**:
  - Read documents from 

raw_documents

.
  - Convert documents to plain text.
  - Save converted text files to 

processed_documents

.

### Step 2: Text Preprocessing Script

- **File**: `src/step2_preprocess_documents.py`
- **Function**: `run()`
- **Description**:
  - Clean and normalize the text from `processed_documents`.
  - Save preprocessed text to 

data/processed_documents_clean

.

### Step 3: Entity Extraction Script

- **File**: `src/step3_extract_entities.py`
- **Function**: `run()`
- **Description**:
  - Extract entities from preprocessed text.
  - Save entities to 

data/entities

 as JSON files.

### Step 4: Relationship Extraction Script

- **File**: `src/step4_extract_relationships.py`
- **Function**: `run()`
- **Description**:
  - Analyze sentences to extract relationships between entities.
  - Save relationships to 

data/relationships

 as JSON files.

### Step 5: Data Structuring and Knowledge Graph Update

- **File**: `src/step5_update_knowledge_graph.py`
- **Function**: `run()`
- **Description**:
  - Structure the extracted data using defined classes.
  - Update the Neo4j knowledge graph with entities and relationships.

### Utilities and Configuration

- **Utilities**:
  - **File**: `src/utils/helper_functions.py`
  - **Description**: Common functions used across multiple scripts (e.g., loading configurations).

- **Configuration**:
  - **File**: `configs/config.yaml`
  - **Description**: Contains configuration settings like file paths and database credentials.

## Next Steps

- **Develop Individual Scripts**: Implement the logic for each script based on the outlined objectives.
- **Define Data Classes**: Create Python classes for 

BoardMeeting

, 

Participant

, 

Event

, and 

Topic

.
- **Set Up Knowledge Graph**: Install and configure Neo4j, and ensure connectivity from the script.
- **Testing**: Test each step individually before running the entire pipeline.
- **Documentation**: Document any assumptions, decisions, and guidelines within the code and supporting files.
