93
00:37:11.015 --> 00:37:14.185

00:37:31.475 --> 00:37:33.925
Were representatives from multiple schools providing

103
00:37:34.165 --> 00:37:36.045

104
00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:37.885

00:37:38.785 --> 00:37:39.965
I'm planning on our next meeting.

106
00:37:39.965 --> 00:37:42.825
Before the upcoming board meeting last week,

107
00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:44.825
I spent my Friday at Murray Elementary School

108
00:37:44.935 --> 00:37:47.225
with their dedicated counselor, Olivia Higgins.

109
00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:50.385
I saw the remarkable work she's doing on Murray campus,

110
00:37:50.485 --> 00:37:52.825
and she goes like, above and beyond her counseling duties.

111
00:37:53.465 --> 00:37:55.705
I had the privilege of observing her while she visited her

112
00:37:55.705 --> 00:37:57.625
classrooms, taught important lessons and

113
00:37:57.825 --> 00:37:59.025
provided assistance throughout the day.

114
00:37:59.365 --> 00:38:01.585
And I saw she also organizes parent workshops

115
00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:03.305
and supports both students and the teachers

116
00:38:03.305 --> 00:38:05.265
around the campus making her a really

117
00:38:05.265 --> 00:38:06.665

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.465
And for my resolution committee group leads,

119
00:38:09.465 --> 00:38:11.065

00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:12.345
but the committee leads are set

00:41:26.615 --> 00:41:28.235
and do our planning procedures.

181
00:41:28.815 --> 00:41:30.955
Uh, then the next phase of our audit is

182
00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:33.485
happened just in the fall here in September,

183
00:41:33.485 --> 00:41:34.725
where we actually come back and audit

184
00:41:34.745 --> 00:41:35.765
the numbers of the district.

185
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:37.725
And then we're here tonight to actually present

186
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:38.765
the, the final results.

187
00:41:41.825 --> 00:41:43.445
Uh, for this year, there were no new

188
00:41:43.445 --> 00:41:45.005
accounting standards that were implemented.

189
00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:48.885
Um, there was one new standard GASB 100, um, that changes

190
00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:51.605
how some of the financial statements are presented as far

191
00:41:51.605 --> 00:41:53.485
as major funds and non-major funds.

192
00:41:53.585 --> 00:41:56.525
But overall, there's no changes to your net position

193
00:41:56.525 --> 00:41:59.445
or financial or fund balance, um, that has been reported.

194
00:42:01.735 --> 00:42:03.945
This year. We did have one audit adjustment,

195
00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:07.505
and it was in your building fund for about $1.3 million.

196
00:42:07.965 --> 00:42:11.305
And, um, it was significant to one of the bond measures

197
00:42:11.305 --> 00:42:13.625
that's within fund 21, which is why we needed

198
00:42:13.645 --> 00:42:14.665
to record that balance.

199
00:42:14.725 --> 00:42:16.785
And essentially, it's a timing difference for an invoice

200
00:42:16.815 --> 00:42:20.665
that was, uh, received much later than after year end.

201
00:42:20.885 --> 00:42:24.225
Uh, and in theory, the, uh, balance should have been accrued

202
00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:25.825
as part of, uh, estimating your

203
00:42:25.825 --> 00:42:27.185
balances at the end of the fiscal year.

204
00:42:27.185 --> 00:42:29.065
It was for services that were performed related

205
00:42:29.065 --> 00:42:32.385
to construction in June, uh, of 2024.

206
00:42:32.845 --> 00:42:34.785
Uh, and so that needed to be updated

207
00:42:34.805 --> 00:42:36.505
to be recorded in the right fiscal year.

208
00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:38.785
We had no other audit adjustments,

209
00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:40.865
and we had no other uncorrected misstatements.

210
00:42:40.865 --> 00:42:42.065
So these are the smaller differences.

211
00:42:42.205 --> 00:42:43.745
As we go through the audit, we track 'em

212
00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:45.665
to make sure they don't aggregate into a material number.

213
00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:50.615
Some of the other required communications we're required

214
00:42:50.615 --> 00:42:51.855
to share with you is that we had no

215
00:42:52.055 --> 00:42:53.215
difficulties in completing the audit.

216
00:42:53.395 --> 00:42:55.135
We had no disagreements with management,

217
00:42:55.315 --> 00:42:56.415
and we're not aware of any other

218
00:42:56.415 --> 00:42:57.815
consultations with other accountants.

219
00:42:57.835 --> 00:42:59.255
So this is, if Chris

220
00:42:59.255 --> 00:43:00.855
and I were discussing an accounting matter

221
00:43:00.855 --> 00:43:02.495
and he didn't like what we had to say, and he went

222
00:43:02.495 --> 00:43:03.895
and pitted us against our competitors

223
00:43:03.895 --> 00:43:06.335
and went out into a shop for an opinion that he liked, uh,

224
00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:08.495
we would wanna share that with you and happy to share.

225
00:43:08.515 --> 00:43:10.575
We don't have any of that, uh, to bring to your attention.

226
00:43:11.075 --> 00:43:12.855
And there was nothing else that was significant

227
00:43:12.855 --> 00:43:13.935
or adverse that happened.

228
00:43:14.275 --> 00:43:19.005
Uh, as related to completing this audit, uh, part

229
00:43:19.005 --> 00:43:21.125
of your audit is also looking at your federal programs.

230
00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:23.565
And so we do that on a rotational basis

231
00:43:23.585 --> 00:43:25.445
of looking at your federal programs that you have.

232
00:43:25.865 --> 00:43:27.965
Uh, this year we looked at your child nutrition cluster

233
00:43:28.145 --> 00:43:31.805
as well as your, uh, ESF uh, programs there.

234
00:43:31.805 --> 00:43:34.445
As that program is starting to wind down, uh,

235
00:43:34.505 --> 00:43:37.685
and we had no findings related to either of those programs.

236
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:41.805
There are several audit opinions in your audit report.

237
00:43:41.805 --> 00:43:43.525
The first is your financial statement opinion.

238
00:43:43.585 --> 00:43:45.685
And so you had an unmodified opinion, which is the type

239
00:43:45.685 --> 00:43:47.365
of opinion you want on your audit report.

240
00:43:47.395 --> 00:43:48.925
Your audit report complies

241
00:43:48.925 --> 00:43:50.405
with all applicable accounting pronouncements

242
00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:51.965
and is free of material misstatement.

243
00:43:52.665 --> 00:43:54.325
You also have federal compliance opinion,

244
00:43:54.325 --> 00:43:55.445
which I just kind of mentioned.

245
00:43:55.465 --> 00:43:57.165
And so there were no findings related to that.

246
00:43:57.185 --> 00:43:59.125
So you have a unmodified opinion there.

247
00:43:59.705 --> 00:44:01.245
And then state compliance, uh,

248
00:44:01.355 --> 00:44:03.165
also had an unmodified opinion this year.

249
00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:04.645
So clean opinions, which is good.

250
00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:08.265
Just a couple key stats for you.

251
00:44:08.485 --> 00:44:11.265
Uh, at June 30th, 2024, the total assets

252
00:44:11.285 --> 00:44:13.545
of the district are about a billion and a half now.

253
00:44:14.045 --> 00:44:16.545
Um, and your total net position is, uh,

254
00:44:16.575 --> 00:44:18.585
just about $400 million there,

255
00:44:18.585 --> 00:44:20.985
which includes your net pension liability with PERS

256
00:44:20.985 --> 00:44:23.825
and stirs, uh, general fund fund balance at the end

257
00:44:23.825 --> 00:44:27.025
of the year was 30, just under $32 million in your

258
00:44:27.025 --> 00:44:29.265
compliance with all of the required reserve requirements

259
00:44:29.265 --> 00:44:30.465
here in the state of California.

260
00:44:32.685 --> 00:44:33.775
Looking at findings

261
00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:34.935
and recommendations this year,

262
00:44:34.935 --> 00:44:36.815
there were two findings in the audit report.

263
00:44:36.875 --> 00:44:38.135
One related to state compliance.

264
00:44:38.155 --> 00:44:40.735
And really, this was a, a really small matter related

265
00:44:40.835 --> 00:44:43.815
to LCAP as far as a classification of an expenditure.

266
00:44:44.395 --> 00:44:47.535
Um, when we looked at the support for it, it was, uh,

267
00:44:47.535 --> 00:44:50.015
technically assigned to the wrong goal as part of,

268
00:44:50.015 --> 00:44:51.695
as you think back to your LCAP plan.

269
00:44:52.115 --> 00:44:55.415
Uh, and so, but, uh, again, this is all unrestricted money.

270
00:44:55.515 --> 00:44:58.215
So, uh, really there's no fiscal impact to this finding,

271
00:44:58.275 --> 00:45:01.495
and hence why we didn't need to qualify the opinion related

272
00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:02.815
to state compliance.

273
00:45:03.515 --> 00:45:05.135
And then the second matter is the one I just, uh,

274
00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.375
mentioned earlier related to the audit

275
00:45:06.375 --> 00:45:07.735
adjustment and accounts payable.

276
00:45:08.195 --> 00:45:11.735
So again, the under accrual of the, uh, one invoice

277
00:45:11.835 --> 00:45:14.295
for construction that occurred in June of 2024.

278
00:45:14.835 --> 00:45:16.815
And so, uh, again, that matter,

279
00:45:16.835 --> 00:45:18.775
it should have been recorded in fiscal year 24,

280
00:45:18.775 --> 00:45:20.655
and it was recorded in fiscal year 25.

281
00:45:20.795 --> 00:45:23.855
And so, uh, that audit adjustment was completed in order to,

282
00:45:24.435 --> 00:45:25.895
uh, correct that situation.

283
00:45:27.905 --> 00:45:29.325
And just to summarize my comments,

284
00:45:29.545 --> 00:45:31.325
the financial statements are presented fairly

285
00:45:31.345 --> 00:45:32.485
in all material respects.

286
00:45:32.785 --> 00:45:35.005
We had the one adjustment, we had the one, uh,

287
00:45:35.435 --> 00:45:36.685
financial statement finding.

288
00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:38.845
And, you know, this is,

289
00:45:39.065 --> 00:45:40.765
you're probably thinking about when you've heard this

290
00:45:40.765 --> 00:45:41.845
report in prior years.

291
00:45:41.995 --> 00:45:43.925
This is about 60 days earlier than you've

292
00:45:43.925 --> 00:45:45.005
ever heard this presentation.

293
00:45:45.665 --> 00:45:48.165
Uh, because management did a great job

294
00:45:48.185 --> 00:45:49.845
of being prepared for our audit this year.

295
00:45:49.865 --> 00:45:52.085
And so we were able to get field work done very early,

296
00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:54.005
actually one of our first districts to get done.

297
00:45:54.025 --> 00:45:56.725
And this is my first board meeting of the season

298
00:45:56.985 --> 00:45:58.445
to present an audit report.

299
00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:02.765
So kudos to your team for, uh, getting all of the stuff

300
00:46:02.765 --> 00:46:05.405
that goes into the audit, which is a lot, uh, ready for us

301
00:46:05.405 --> 00:46:06.565
to be able to look at

302
00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:08.765
and be able to be here tonight to present the,

303
00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:09.885
the final results to you.

304
00:46:09.985 --> 00:46:12.405
So overall, I think very good results for,

305
00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:14.405
for the year ended June 30th, 2024.

306
00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:16.845
With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

307
00:46:18.185 --> 00:46:19.725
All right. Any questions from board members?

308
00:46:21.115 --> 00:46:23.885
Trustee speck? Uh, thank you for that.

309
00:46:23.965 --> 00:46:25.965
I just have one question. What happens now

310
00:46:25.965 --> 00:46:26.965
with the building fund?

311
00:46:26.985 --> 00:46:29.685
Do we have like a new final budget from last year with

312
00:46:29.685 --> 00:46:31.365
that 1 million accrued in

313
00:46:31.365 --> 00:46:36.205
and showing that amount, um, in like, the reserve funds?

314
00:46:36.475 --> 00:46:38.645
Like how do we as a district like account for that?

315
00:46:39.895 --> 00:46:41.245
Maybe I'll start and let you finish here.

316
00:46:41.245 --> 00:46:43.925
Just, uh, I mean, from a, from the audit report perspective,

317
00:46:43.925 --> 00:46:45.765
that's been corrected in the, in the report.

318
00:46:45.905 --> 00:46:48.325
So the ending numbers, there are the numbers we are gonna

319
00:46:48.325 --> 00:46:50.285
roll forward into to next year,

320
00:46:50.785 --> 00:46:53.445
may let Chris talk about it from a budget perspective there.

321
00:46:54.705 --> 00:46:56.515
Yeah. So again, the impact basically is

322
00:46:56.515 --> 00:46:57.675
that the expenditure

323
00:46:57.675 --> 00:46:59.275
that we had already recorded in the current year

324
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.475
should have been recorded last year.

325
00:47:00.535 --> 00:47:03.795
So we'll show that the, um, ending fund balance

326
00:47:03.855 --> 00:47:06.955
for last year is that $1.2 million lower starting balance

327
00:47:06.955 --> 00:47:09.035
this year will be $1.2 million lower,

328
00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:11.515
and we won't have that expense in this year.

329
00:47:11.905 --> 00:47:13.715
Doesn't impact the overall expense

330
00:47:13.715 --> 00:47:14.755
of their cost of the project.

331
00:47:14.905 --> 00:47:16.955
Just impacts the timing of when we reported that.

332
00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:19.515
Right. So whatever number I had from what we did in June,

333
00:47:20.005 --> 00:47:23.035
it'll just be that 1.2 will be going into that year.

334
00:47:23.035 --> 00:47:25.515
Correct. So when you present next time, um, in December,

335
00:47:25.615 --> 00:47:26.715
you'll have Yep.

336
00:47:26.855 --> 00:47:28.235
Adjust there. Okay. Thank you.

337
00:47:30.915 --> 00:47:32.675
Anything else, Jesse? Chair?

338
00:47:35.475 --> 00:47:39.895
Uh, I appreciate the report and forgive my ignorance.

339
00:47:40.135 --> 00:47:41.535
I should know this. Um,

340
00:47:43.515 --> 00:47:46.375
th this is the financial audit.

341
00:47:46.915 --> 00:47:49.615
And then what's the other audit call that we do?

342
00:47:51.885 --> 00:47:53.845
I mean, this is the annual audit

343
00:47:54.035 --> 00:47:55.125
that you're required to have.

344
00:47:55.185 --> 00:47:56.765
You also, maybe you're thinking of the bond

345
00:47:56.835 --> 00:47:57.845
Bond audit bond Audits?

346
00:47:57.845 --> 00:47:59.485
Yes, the performance audit and financial audits

347
00:47:59.485 --> 00:48:00.485
of our bond measures.

348
00:48:00.485 --> 00:48:02.885
Okay. And we're still finalizing those reports right now.

349
00:48:02.945 --> 00:48:04.605
So those will be presented at a later meeting.

350
00:48:05.155 --> 00:48:07.365
Okay. And that's where you do the,

351
00:48:07.605 --> 00:48:10.205
make sure the expenditures are in accordance with the Okay.

352
00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:11.365
Yep. In accordance with prop.

353
00:48:11.865 --> 00:48:13.005
And when does that normally,

354
00:48:13.555 --> 00:48:15.125
that'll normally be back in the

355
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.165
spring or something? Correct.

356
00:48:16.635 --> 00:48:18.485
Okay. They're very close to being done.

357
00:48:18.745 --> 00:48:20.565
Um, it just, they didn't make it in time

358
00:48:20.565 --> 00:48:21.805
for this meeting, so, okay.

359
00:48:22.015 --> 00:48:26.785
Great. Thank you. Do we

360
00:48:26.905 --> 00:48:29.545
need to officially vote to approve

361
00:48:29.645 --> 00:48:32.635
and accept these? Yes. Okay.

362
00:48:32.695 --> 00:48:34.635
It, it's the receipt Of the before rec receipting.

363
00:48:34.635 --> 00:48:36.355
Okay. Before we do that, I just would like

364
00:48:36.355 --> 00:48:38.595
to compliment Chris and your team in doing this.

365
00:48:38.595 --> 00:48:40.195
And I know there's a lot that goes into this

366
00:48:40.195 --> 00:48:42.555
and appreciate that on top of everything and,

367
00:48:42.555 --> 00:48:43.675
and everything looks good.

368
00:48:43.675 --> 00:48:47.835
So kudos to you and your finance, your team and business.

369
00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:50.715
Yes. So this is the audited actuals right

370
00:48:50.715 --> 00:48:51.715
after the unaudited.

371
00:48:51.715 --> 00:48:52.915
Right. Okay.

372
00:48:53.465 --> 00:48:57.815
Following my little pinwheel, my little pie chart.

373
00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:00.415
Um, yes, trustee Co has a good question.

374
00:49:01.315 --> 00:49:05.335
Um, just to be clear, is this has no in no bearing

375
00:49:05.395 --> 00:49:08.015
or impact on our, our current budget situation

376
00:49:08.015 --> 00:49:11.415
where we're discussing, um, the budget that you laid out

377
00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.455
to the community has not,

378
00:49:12.725 --> 00:49:14.335
just doesn't impact that in any way.

379
00:49:14.495 --> 00:49:16.895
'cause this is bond funds, right? Construction.

380
00:49:18.535 --> 00:49:21.075
So this was the entire, uh, district's position,

381
00:49:21.095 --> 00:49:23.355
but there were no changes, no adjustments made

382
00:49:23.355 --> 00:49:25.075
to the general fund whatsoever.

383
00:49:25.415 --> 00:49:27.475
The only adjustment that was made was in the bond funds.

384
00:49:27.825 --> 00:49:30.985
Okay. Thanks. So I'll take a motion

385
00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:33.465
to accept this audit report.

386
00:49:33.775 --> 00:49:37.185
I'll move that we, um, accept receipt of the audit report

387
00:49:37.185 --> 00:49:38.985
for fiscal year ended June 30th, 2024.

388
00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:44.515
I'll second. All right. I have a motion a second.

389
00:49:44.995 --> 00:49:48.905
Anything else, trustee? PE 20. Aye. Everyone else? Aye. Aye.

390
00:49:49.125 --> 00:49:51.705
Aye. Aye. Motion carries unanimously. Thank you.

391
00:49:51.705 --> 00:49:56.155
Okay, thank you. Um,

392
00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:01.385
next up is our general public comment period.

393
00:50:01.775 --> 00:50:04.065
This is for items that are not on the regular agenda.

394
00:50:04.885 --> 00:50:07.105
Um, do you, do you have any comment cards?

395
00:50:08.925 --> 00:50:10.305
No, I have one for specific

396
00:50:10.305 --> 00:50:11.305
Items. Okay. So this

397
00:50:11.305 --> 00:50:12.425
is for, for general ones.

398
00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:14.265
If you have something for a specific item, that's great

399
00:50:14.265 --> 00:50:15.305
to do it during that item.

400
00:50:15.845 --> 00:50:19.505
Um, I will give the public kind of one more minute to log on

401
00:50:19.565 --> 00:50:21.185
and see if anyone else wanted

402
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:22.745
to make a public comment at this time.

403
00:50:24.005 --> 00:50:26.185
Um, and I don't see anyone coming

404
00:50:26.185 --> 00:50:28.045
forward to fill out a be paper.

405
00:50:31.075 --> 00:50:33.085
Only one person. Only one. Only one person online.

406
00:50:33.145 --> 00:50:35.375
And they haven't raised their hand. Okay.

407
00:50:35.405 --> 00:50:36.495
Then I'm gonna move on.

408
00:50:37.845 --> 00:50:42.235
Um, next up we have a public hearing, um, regarding, um,

409
00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:43.395
acquisition of property.

410
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:46.935
Once again, we have Chris Hobbs.

411
00:50:47.275 --> 00:50:50.295
Uh, we will introduce this along with Owen Fish.

412
00:51:00.505 --> 00:51:02.915
Good evening again. Uh, tonight we're asking the board

413
00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:04.155
to hold a public hearing

414
00:51:04.535 --> 00:51:07.715
and then to pass a resolution, basically stating that the,

415
00:51:07.715 --> 00:51:08.915
uh, the land selected

416
00:51:08.935 --> 00:51:10.475
for the Shamrock Hills project is

417
00:51:10.475 --> 00:51:11.795
appropriate for a school site.

418
00:51:12.495 --> 00:51:15.875
Um, this is a, a, a statutory requirement.

419
00:51:15.895 --> 00:51:18.035
One of the things we need to do before we ultimately finish

420
00:51:18.095 --> 00:51:20.355
the, uh, the purchase agreement with the city for this land.

421
00:51:20.825 --> 00:51:23.475
This is a process of course, that began, uh,

422
00:51:23.535 --> 00:51:27.825
before my tenure back in 20 16 14 timeline.

423
00:51:27.825 --> 00:51:29.505
I don't remember exactly when we first started working

424
00:51:29.505 --> 00:51:30.945
with the city on the, uh, project,

425
00:51:31.205 --> 00:51:34.745
but this is the kind of the next to last step

426
00:51:34.745 --> 00:51:36.425
before we actually execute a purchase agreement

427
00:51:36.425 --> 00:51:38.705
with the city to complete the purchase of the land.

428
00:51:39.725 --> 00:51:41.145
And I'm happy to answer any questions

429
00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:42.865
or take any comments the board might have.

430
00:51:44.595 --> 00:51:47.375
All right. I'm gonna open the public hearing. Thank you.

431
00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:48.735
Right, because we have to make this a public hearing

432
00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:52.615
and confirm.

433
00:51:52.675 --> 00:51:54.935
Do we have any speakers for the public hearing?

434
00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:58.615
Wish to make any comments? No one online.

435
00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:06.405
All right. I'll give it another 10 seconds or so. All right.

436
00:52:07.105 --> 00:52:08.125
I'm gonna close the public hearing.

437
00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:11.165
Um, and then trustee, if you have any questions,

438
00:52:11.165 --> 00:52:12.405
trustee Blackman, do you have a question?

439
00:52:14.835 --> 00:52:17.155
Thank you very much, um, for presenting this information.

440
00:52:17.555 --> 00:52:19.035
A couple questions. So I understand

441
00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:21.475
that we're basically accepting the site as is.

442
00:52:22.175 --> 00:52:23.475
Um, there was a point in time

443
00:52:23.475 --> 00:52:25.555
where the site was transferred from the military

444
00:52:25.695 --> 00:52:27.355
to the developer, from the developer

445
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:28.875
to the city, from the city to ourselves.

446
00:52:29.655 --> 00:52:32.635
At any point in time, knowing the military had used this

447
00:52:32.635 --> 00:52:35.195
site for various purposes, I won't discuss here in public,

448
00:52:35.335 --> 00:52:39.355
but was there any point in time where a soil study was done

449
00:52:39.495 --> 00:52:42.235
to ensure that there is no hazards currently on the

450
00:52:42.235 --> 00:52:43.515
site in the soils?

451
00:52:43.715 --> 00:52:45.835
I think I actually am gonna invite Owen up to talk to that

452
00:52:45.835 --> 00:52:47.035
because we are working with, um,

453
00:52:47.405 --> 00:52:49.275
doing those soil studies now.

454
00:52:52.055 --> 00:52:53.315
Yes. Trustee Blackman,

455
00:52:53.315 --> 00:52:56.275
we did enter into an oversight agreement with Department

456
00:52:56.275 --> 00:52:57.635
of Toxic Substance Control.

457
00:52:58.295 --> 00:53:00.715
We have completed all the testing at this point.

458
00:53:00.715 --> 00:53:03.945
There were, there was one finding of a little bit

459
00:53:03.945 --> 00:53:08.865
of lead in one area, uh, that we have removed at this point.

460
00:53:09.685 --> 00:53:13.745
And there was, um, soil vapor tests that we've done

461
00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:15.985
that the tests were slightly elevated.

462
00:53:16.365 --> 00:53:19.225
We have one more round of testing of that vapor,

463
00:53:19.765 --> 00:53:21.985
of those vapor wells that we installed.

464
00:53:22.805 --> 00:53:27.245
Once that is complete, we've already submitted to DTSC, our

465
00:53:27.845 --> 00:53:30.095
PEA and that's in draft.

466
00:53:30.095 --> 00:53:31.295
They're reviewing it right now.

467
00:53:31.995 --> 00:53:34.805
Once that's approved back by them, it has a mitigation

468
00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:37.285
for those vapor issues that exist.

469
00:53:37.665 --> 00:53:41.205
And that should conclude our, uh, the process with the

470
00:53:41.975 --> 00:53:44.745
soil task sampling and testing that we have on the site.

471
00:53:46.045 --> 00:53:48.195
Thank you for that information. I hope it turns out well.

472
00:53:48.735 --> 00:53:51.715
My next question is, um, with regard to in the document,

473
00:53:51.715 --> 00:53:53.075
it talks about a future SE QA.

474
00:53:54.225 --> 00:53:56.445
And have we, um, I'm just curious,

475
00:53:56.735 --> 00:53:59.285
we're receiving the site from the city at any point in time.

476
00:54:00.465 --> 00:54:03.405
Was there a seq a done for the site previously?

477
00:54:03.495 --> 00:54:05.885
There was a C equa done previously for the site

478
00:54:05.885 --> 00:54:09.415
by the city, and we have, I believe we previously brought

479
00:54:09.415 --> 00:54:12.615
that CA that, uh, EIR to the board,

480
00:54:12.615 --> 00:54:14.655
and we adopted that for the city.

481
00:54:14.715 --> 00:54:18.345
The CQA that it refers to is when, uh,

482
00:54:19.325 --> 00:54:22.665
as we submitted this PEA to DTSC, we are required

483
00:54:22.665 --> 00:54:25.385
to enter a CQA process with them in relation

484
00:54:25.385 --> 00:54:27.555
to the mitigation of the environmental

485
00:54:27.555 --> 00:54:28.835
issues that have been found.

486
00:54:30.035 --> 00:54:32.985
That document is now submitted.

487
00:54:32.985 --> 00:54:35.265
We're putting an advertisement in the paper currently,

488
00:54:35.325 --> 00:54:38.225
and I think on the next, not the next board meeting,

489
00:54:38.245 --> 00:54:39.785
but the following board meeting, we have an,

490
00:54:40.275 --> 00:54:43.185
where we're bringing a public comment period to,

491
00:54:43.445 --> 00:54:46.305
to the board meeting to ex receive any comments

492
00:54:46.405 --> 00:54:47.825
in relation to that PEA.

493
00:54:47.825 --> 00:54:50.425
And that will be, that will finalize the qua in relation

494
00:54:50.425 --> 00:54:52.465
to the DTSC oversight agreement.

495
00:54:52.535 --> 00:54:54.505
Okay. That is helpful. 'cause I, I wasn't certain

496
00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:56.425
that we were gonna adopt the CQA

497
00:54:56.425 --> 00:54:57.745
and use that for these purposes,

498
00:54:57.745 --> 00:55:00.025
or we were gonna start the CQ process we're required to.

499
00:55:00.245 --> 00:55:02.185
So we're just taking what we already have. And

500
00:55:02.455 --> 00:55:04.905
Yeah, so we've already done a ce a process in relation

501
00:55:04.905 --> 00:55:09.465
to all of the other issues in regards to the EIR, the CA,

502
00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:13.345
there is ACE a process that DTSC does independently,

503
00:55:14.295 --> 00:55:17.795
and that is part of our PEA approval with them.

504
00:55:17.815 --> 00:55:20.765
And that is the only thing that's left in regards

505
00:55:20.765 --> 00:55:21.885
to a C for the property.

506
00:55:22.645 --> 00:55:24.355
Thank you for those answers. Helps.

507
00:55:24.895 --> 00:55:27.035
Um, one other question I have, it has more to do

508
00:55:27.035 --> 00:55:30.195
with the actual agreement with receiving the property, um,

509
00:55:30.415 --> 00:55:33.115
if I'm not correct, way back when there was an option

510
00:55:33.115 --> 00:55:34.505
to lease from the city

511
00:55:34.645 --> 00:55:37.265
or an option to pursue, um, purchasing.

512
00:55:38.185 --> 00:55:40.425
I know that when we get into purchase agreements,

513
00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:42.585
there's a little bit of this, I,

514
00:55:42.655 --> 00:55:44.185
this is going back quite a ways.

515
00:55:45.365 --> 00:55:46.905
The deal with the city was always

516
00:55:46.905 --> 00:55:49.505
that if we get reimbursement from the state, some of

517
00:55:49.505 --> 00:55:50.785
that reimbursement would actually

518
00:55:50.785 --> 00:55:52.225
retroactively go back to the city.

519
00:55:52.455 --> 00:55:55.465
Presuming the city had to negotiate some sort of forgiveness

520
00:55:55.605 --> 00:55:58.545
of some aspect of a deal with the developer in order

521
00:55:58.545 --> 00:55:59.985
to receive that land for our use.

522
00:56:00.765 --> 00:56:03.505
Is there anything at this point that we actually would have

523
00:56:03.505 --> 00:56:06.745
to, if we apply to the state for some sort of reimbursement?

524
00:56:06.745 --> 00:56:07.585
And again, that's why I'm asking

525
00:56:07.585 --> 00:56:08.465
how much we're buying it for.

526
00:56:09.205 --> 00:56:10.905
Is there something that we end up owing the city at some

527
00:56:10.905 --> 00:56:12.265
point, or is that nullified at this point?

528
00:56:13.005 --> 00:56:14.265
No, we expect that would be part

529
00:56:14.265 --> 00:56:17.365
of the settled purchase agreement based on,

530
00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:20.605
based on the memo, uh, MOUs

531
00:56:20.605 --> 00:56:22.405
that were previously agreed to with the city.

532
00:56:23.415 --> 00:56:25.675
So today we're just approving that we're receiving

533
00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:28.235
and agreeing to, to acquire the land.

534
00:56:28.235 --> 00:56:29.675
We're not necessarily agreeing to

535
00:56:29.675 --> 00:56:31.355
that purchase agreement tonight.

536
00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:33.275
You're just approving that the site is a valid,

537
00:56:33.275 --> 00:56:34.715
legitimate site for the purpose

538
00:56:34.715 --> 00:56:35.995
of put putting a school on it.

539
00:56:36.575 --> 00:56:38.825
Well, there's no fiscal impact. Okay. Thank you so much.

540
00:56:38.945 --> 00:56:39.945
I appreciate that.

541
00:56:43.405 --> 00:56:46.665
Any other questions? That way they'll take a motion

542
00:56:46.725 --> 00:56:48.185
to approve this resolution.

543
00:56:49.855 --> 00:56:53.425
I'll move that. We approve the resolution number 2024

544
00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:55.225
slash 25 dash 20.

545
00:56:56.215 --> 00:56:59.435
I'll second Motion and a second. Any other motions?

546
00:57:00.495 --> 00:57:04.585
Trustee Fest? 20. Aye. Everyone else? Aye. Aye.

547
00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:08.465
Motion carries unanimously. All right.

548
00:57:08.965 --> 00:57:13.425
Um, next up we have another resolution, um, discussing, um,

549
00:57:13.425 --> 00:57:15.185
mental health facilities and resources,

550
00:57:15.185 --> 00:57:17.465
and I think this is, uh, trustee PE 20. Yes.

551
00:57:18.245 --> 00:57:19.945
So today we have Mic Shannon

552
00:57:20.885 --> 00:57:23.025
and Dublin High School seniors, Vidant Cigar

553
00:57:23.025 --> 00:57:25.385
and Olivia Cho, who are presenting a resolution

554
00:57:25.405 --> 00:57:28.025
to build on the existing mental health support already

555
00:57:28.025 --> 00:57:29.025
available in our schools.

556
00:57:29.515 --> 00:57:31.665
While the district currently already does provide

557
00:57:32.265 --> 00:57:33.585
valuable mental wellness resources,

558
00:57:33.815 --> 00:57:37.105
this resolution suggests additional steps to expand access

559
00:57:37.165 --> 00:57:39.065
and strengthen supports on every campus.

560
00:57:39.885 --> 00:57:41.785
The proposal includes ongoing support

561
00:57:41.785 --> 00:57:44.745
for mental health staff, extending social emotional learning

562
00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:47.545
to all grade levels, and adding more wellness spaces to,

563
00:57:47.805 --> 00:57:49.545
to create a welcome, welcoming

564
00:57:49.545 --> 00:57:51.265
and inclusive environment for all students.

565
00:57:53.235 --> 00:57:55.345
These students have made tremendous contributions

566
00:57:55.345 --> 00:57:56.505
as mental wellness ambassadors

567
00:57:56.505 --> 00:57:57.985
to their own high school Dublin High,

568
00:57:58.165 --> 00:58:01.225
and now continue to make this impact across our district.

569
00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:08.825
Just a quick question. I'm seeing a presentation.

570
00:58:09.145 --> 00:58:13.955
I don't think that was on the agenda, right?

571
00:58:14.535 --> 00:58:17.875
It was not. Um, so we had a present,

572
00:58:17.945 --> 00:58:19.155
they had a presentation ready,

573
00:58:19.255 --> 00:58:21.915
but I don't think I, it was there at the time,

574
00:58:22.055 --> 00:58:23.635
but I gave it to karaoke

575
00:58:23.695 --> 00:58:25.315
and he put it on the, like,

576
00:58:25.765 --> 00:58:27.995
it'll be displayed on the screen, but their own resolution

577
00:58:28.455 --> 00:58:30.715
Is if it wasn't published ahead of time.

578
00:58:31.225 --> 00:58:33.455
Yeah. Be sure.

579
00:58:33.925 --> 00:58:37.455
Yeah. Uh, the only requirement according the Brown Act is

580
00:58:37.455 --> 00:58:39.055
that you must post the agenda.

581
00:58:40.035 --> 00:58:42.455
And as far everything else is optional.

582
00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:44.415
That's the way I understand the Brown

583
00:58:44.435 --> 00:58:45.895
Act. I'm not an attorney, I just,

584
00:58:46.205 --> 00:58:47.615
That is my, uh, I just wanna make sure.

585
00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:51.375
I, I think if the consensus of the board is to allow

586
00:58:51.475 --> 00:58:54.095
for the presentation, uh, then we can move forward with it.

587
00:58:54.275 --> 00:58:56.335
But in the future, it needs to be part

588
00:58:56.335 --> 00:58:58.695
of the agenda package, uh, and, and,

589
00:58:58.715 --> 00:59:01.535
and state it in the memo that it is a presentation.

590
00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:02.805
Okay.

591
00:59:03.815 --> 00:59:06.875
We do like, like to preview them ahead of time. Go ahead.

592
00:59:18.045 --> 00:59:21.055
Okay. Um, good evening, superintendent, funk President,

593
00:59:21.445 --> 00:59:23.445
Pellum, vice President, and trustees.

594
00:59:24.065 --> 00:59:26.285
Um, today we're really thankful to be able

595
00:59:26.285 --> 00:59:28.605
to have the opportunity to speak about the enhancement

596
00:59:28.605 --> 00:59:29.885
of mental health facilities

597
00:59:29.885 --> 00:59:32.365
and resources in the Delvin Unified School District.

598
00:59:32.745 --> 00:59:34.005
My name is Olivia Cho,

599
00:59:35.375 --> 00:59:36.555
And my name is Segre.

600
00:59:37.565 --> 00:59:42.345
Um, yes. So our, uh, so the reason

601
00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:43.865
that we are presenting this resolution is

602
00:59:43.865 --> 00:59:46.105
because we've seen a, a drastic impact on, uh,

603
00:59:46.105 --> 00:59:47.145
the decrease in mental health.

604
00:59:47.485 --> 00:59:50.705
Uh, firstly, there's an alarming, um, increasing the number

605
00:59:50.705 --> 00:59:51.945
of suicides in 2022.

606
00:59:51.945 --> 00:59:53.025
We see the highest number

607
00:59:53.025 --> 00:59:55.665
of suicide suicides in the US according to mental health,

608
00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:56.785
uh, america.com.

609
00:59:57.125 --> 01:00:00.305
And, uh, we, uh, secondly, we've also seen 65%

610
01:00:00.425 --> 01:00:02.985
of these youth who, uh, suffer from mental illness, uh,

611
01:00:03.005 --> 01:00:04.105
are going without treatment,

612
01:00:04.305 --> 01:00:06.945
although they're given these, uh, services, um, which is,

613
01:00:06.945 --> 01:00:08.545
uh, which is really, really alarming.

614
01:00:08.565 --> 01:00:11.065
Uh, thirdly, we've seen, uh, the, the reason for this cause

615
01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:13.065
of decline in mental health is

616
01:00:13.065 --> 01:00:15.225
because the growing pressure of academics, uh, for example,

617
01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:16.745
uh, personal anecdote is that, um,

618
01:00:16.925 --> 01:00:19.905
my math classes at high school in my current high school are

619
01:00:19.935 --> 01:00:21.785
much, much harder than, uh, uh,

620
01:00:22.025 --> 01:00:24.665
calculus classes I've taken at Berkeley, uh, Berkeley's, uh,

621
01:00:24.865 --> 01:00:26.185
uc, Berkeley's renowned, uh, for their,

622
01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:27.585
uh, rigorous, uh, education.

623
01:00:27.585 --> 01:00:29.825
However, our high school's education is more rigorous,

624
01:00:29.825 --> 01:00:32.025
which is causing a huge impact in the mental health

625
01:00:32.025 --> 01:00:34.385
of multiple, uh, in various, uh, different types

626
01:00:34.385 --> 01:00:35.745
of students across campus.

627
01:00:36.035 --> 01:00:37.785
We've also seen a stigma, um,

628
01:00:38.445 --> 01:00:40.385
stigma a about receiving support,

629
01:00:40.385 --> 01:00:42.345
especially in Asian populations such as Asians

630
01:00:42.345 --> 01:00:44.585
and Indians, that, uh, receiving support, um,

631
01:00:44.885 --> 01:00:47.865
for mental health is sometimes considered weak

632
01:00:48.005 --> 01:00:50.025
or looked down upon, uh, which is some, uh,

633
01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:51.425
which is a stigma which we wanna combat.

634
01:00:51.445 --> 01:00:53.385
Uh, and thirdly, we have, uh, limited resource

635
01:00:53.385 --> 01:00:54.465
of, uh, resources available.

636
01:00:54.765 --> 01:00:57.065
Uh, as we know there are budget cuts happening in USD.

637
01:00:57.065 --> 01:00:58.305
And one of the, uh, aspects

638
01:00:58.305 --> 01:01:00.225
that was affected was the mental, uh,

639
01:01:00.225 --> 01:01:01.745
once was the mental health department.

640
01:01:01.885 --> 01:01:03.865
And due to this, we've seen a lack in resources.

641
01:01:03.865 --> 01:01:05.985
We've seen our mental health staff take on multiple roles,

642
01:01:06.325 --> 01:01:08.945
um, and that's caused, uh, a decline in the mental health.

643
01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:12.815
Um, I'd also like to speak about student

644
01:01:12.815 --> 01:01:13.935
access to resources.

645
01:01:14.075 --> 01:01:16.175
We understand that there are already resources

646
01:01:16.175 --> 01:01:19.895
that student have available to them, um, such

647
01:01:19.895 --> 01:01:22.575
as human access that Dublin High actually has.

648
01:01:23.165 --> 01:01:26.655
I've personally received help, um, and care from Hume,

649
01:01:26.675 --> 01:01:29.255
and I know how important it is for students

650
01:01:29.275 --> 01:01:30.775
to be receiving the support.

651
01:01:31.315 --> 01:01:35.655
Um, but there aren't limited numbers of caseloads that, um,

652
01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:38.895
that me clinicians can take on.

653
01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:43.575
Um, and within the ne, within this past school year,

654
01:01:43.585 --> 01:01:46.455
we've already had 1,100 students, um,

655
01:01:46.465 --> 01:01:47.655
visit the wellness Center.

656
01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:50.815
Um, based on this, within this school year,

657
01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:54.095
we we're projecting a 3% increase, um,

658
01:01:54.925 --> 01:01:57.215
overall in the increase of use, use

659
01:01:57.275 --> 01:01:58.655
of mental health services,

660
01:01:59.335 --> 01:02:00.655
specifically in Dublin High School.

661
01:02:01.155 --> 01:02:04.575
But that is also, um, goes to show

662
01:02:04.635 --> 01:02:07.175
how mental health is declining in the district as a whole.

663
01:02:07.835 --> 01:02:10.775
Um, and less than 11%

664
01:02:11.075 --> 01:02:13.975
of black adolescents receive treatment for mental health.

665
01:02:14.395 --> 01:02:15.975
And the reason why I bring this up is,

666
01:02:15.975 --> 01:02:18.175
going back on our point, there are certain marginalized

667
01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:21.485
groups that need more support than others, um, to take care

668
01:02:21.485 --> 01:02:23.885
of their mental health and to receive proper treatment.

669
01:02:24.225 --> 01:02:27.365
It might involve extra conversations that might need

670
01:02:27.365 --> 01:02:30.805
to be had in order to help uplift these student groups, um,

671
01:02:31.945 --> 01:02:34.445
as well as making sure that, um,

672
01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:40.155
hopefully other schools will have, um, better wellness

673
01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:43.595
centers and mental health resources.

674
01:02:43.595 --> 01:02:46.995
According to the Dublin Unified School District website,

675
01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:50.875
the Dublin High School is the only school on in district

676
01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:52.475
to have a wellness center.

677
01:02:53.095 --> 01:02:54.955
Um, so we understand

678
01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:57.315
and recognize the efforts that are already being made,

679
01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.355
but these are some points that

680
01:02:58.355 --> 01:02:59.395
we wanted to bring up as well.

681
01:03:02.895 --> 01:03:05.635
So, uh, we would like to move on to the influence of, uh,

682
01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:07.275
staff on mental health of students.

683
01:03:07.655 --> 01:03:10.155
Uh, so currently we've seen that, uh, current staff is go,

684
01:03:10.155 --> 01:03:12.635
uh, going down as, um, for example, um,

685
01:03:12.815 --> 01:03:14.675
our representative over here mix mixed in,

686
01:03:14.675 --> 01:03:15.835
is taking on multiple roles.

687
01:03:16.175 --> 01:03:17.355
And, um, some

688
01:03:17.355 --> 01:03:18.995
of staff is also moving to Emerald High School.

689
01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:20.875
And, uh, due to the budget cuts

690
01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:22.435
and, uh, staff moving to Emerald High School

691
01:03:22.455 --> 01:03:25.315
and staff currently taking on multiple roles, um, we've seen

692
01:03:25.315 --> 01:03:26.555
that staff is going down, which means

693
01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:27.555
that there is less support

694
01:03:27.575 --> 01:03:28.755
for students at Dublin High School.

695
01:03:28.975 --> 01:03:31.555
As we know, Dublin High has over 4,000 kids, which is, um,

696
01:03:31.965 --> 01:03:33.115
tremendous amount of students.

697
01:03:33.175 --> 01:03:35.275
We need to make sure that we have enough mental health

698
01:03:35.275 --> 01:03:38.475
counselors to, uh, be enough to, uh, consult these students.

699
01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:41.155
Moving on, uh, going off my last point,

700
01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:44.115
we are exceeding the one to 500 counselor to student ratio.

701
01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:45.875
This is the ratio that is recommended.

702
01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:47.275
However, we are way over that.

703
01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:49.195
So we need to make sure that we are combating this.

704
01:03:49.375 --> 01:03:50.475
And thirdly, we are, we need

705
01:03:50.475 --> 01:03:51.995
to talk about the mental health needs.

706
01:03:52.415 --> 01:03:57.235
Uh, in 2024, we saw 16.9, uh, 16.9% of teenagers, um,

707
01:03:57.235 --> 01:04:00.635
suffer from mental health, um, uh, illnesses and sicknesses.

708
01:04:00.895 --> 01:04:03.915
And in, we have a current, currently in 2024,

709
01:04:03.915 --> 01:04:05.235
we have an emerging mental health crisis.

710
01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.075
And, uh, do, uh, knowing that we know that this, uh,

711
01:04:08.225 --> 01:04:11.195
this percentage will increase, uh, knowing that fact,

712
01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:12.755
it is essential to make sure

713
01:04:12.755 --> 01:04:14.595
that our mental health concerns are addressed.

714
01:04:16.745 --> 01:04:17.765
Um, and we just wanted

715
01:04:17.765 --> 01:04:20.245
to touch on some Dublin Unified policies.

716
01:04:20.585 --> 01:04:24.285
We do understand that in Dublin, Unified's, lcap, um,

717
01:04:24.555 --> 01:04:26.765
they have outlined that they're committing themselves

718
01:04:26.865 --> 01:04:28.805
to providing students with a safe

719
01:04:28.805 --> 01:04:31.525
and modern learning environment, um, as well

720
01:04:31.525 --> 01:04:33.845
as highly qualified personnel.

721
01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:37.645
Um, this is where our hopes of more training

722
01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:40.405
for mental health specifically will be able

723
01:04:40.405 --> 01:04:44.245
to be brought on, um, for staff that currently exists.

724
01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:49.125
Um, and we also wanted to point out that the Dublin United,

725
01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.845
uh, UN Unified School district's attendance policy

726
01:04:53.465 --> 01:04:54.525
has not been updated

727
01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:57.405
to explicitly outline excused absences to Inc.

728
01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:00.485
Um, to include the absences to the benefit

729
01:05:00.665 --> 01:05:01.685
of the pupil's mental

730
01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:06.205
or behavioral health, which is outlined in 48 2 0 5

731
01:05:06.265 --> 01:05:08.325
of the California Educational Code,

732
01:05:08.415 --> 01:05:10.525
which was ratified in 2021.

733
01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:14.325
This leads a lot of students to be faced with the choices

734
01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:15.645
of choosing their mental health

735
01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:18.405
or choosing to miss academic time.

736
01:05:19.025 --> 01:05:21.045
And especially for upperclassmen,

737
01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:23.245
this is a really hard decision.

738
01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:26.205
'cause we know that the academic rigor in Dublin is

739
01:05:26.395 --> 01:05:27.845
very, very tough.

740
01:05:28.385 --> 01:05:30.565
Um, as well as understanding that making sure

741
01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:32.725
that you are well as a student is very important

742
01:05:32.725 --> 01:05:34.285
to make sure that you can do better in

743
01:05:34.285 --> 01:05:35.405
your academics as well.

744
01:05:35.945 --> 01:05:40.155
Um, so those are the two policies that we want to outline.

745
01:05:44.955 --> 01:05:47.295
So therefore, uh, we can move on to what we, uh,

746
01:05:47.295 --> 01:05:49.335
what we want, uh, would want to resolve.

747
01:05:49.595 --> 01:05:51.895
Uh, firstly, we would wanna increase the training for, uh,

748
01:05:51.895 --> 01:05:53.175
staff on assisting youth in crisis.

749
01:05:53.275 --> 01:05:55.295
We are, um, we are faced with the issue

750
01:05:55.295 --> 01:05:56.975
of not having enough mental health staff

751
01:05:56.975 --> 01:05:58.095
to combat this issue.

752
01:05:58.095 --> 01:06:00.535
Rather than hiring a whole new mental health counselor,

753
01:06:00.595 --> 01:06:04.415
we can, um, offer preexisting, uh, staff

754
01:06:04.415 --> 01:06:05.935
with the correct mental health certification

755
01:06:05.935 --> 01:06:09.055
and education, uh, in order to help, uh, students in need.

756
01:06:09.315 --> 01:06:11.335
Uh, secondly, we would like to spread awareness on, um,

757
01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:13.615
about this issue through seminars, webinars,

758
01:06:13.615 --> 01:06:16.375
and presentations to, uh, especially to groups such as, uh,

759
01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:18.135
as I mentioned before, uh, Indians

760
01:06:18.135 --> 01:06:20.695
and agents who feel like, uh, it is weak

761
01:06:20.715 --> 01:06:23.375
or to, um, it is weak to us, uh, seek support

762
01:06:23.635 --> 01:06:24.655
and things of that nature.

763
01:06:24.715 --> 01:06:27.295
And thirdly, we would like to add, uh, allocate resources

764
01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:29.375
to more schools across the district to make sure

765
01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:31.095
that we are reaching every single, um,

766
01:06:31.225 --> 01:06:33.335
every single school rather than only Dublin High.

767
01:06:33.555 --> 01:06:35.855
Uh, we can do this by, uh, allocating resources to mental,

768
01:06:35.915 --> 01:06:36.975
uh, mental health facilities

769
01:06:36.975 --> 01:06:39.015
or wellness centers that already exist in certain schools,

770
01:06:39.075 --> 01:06:40.415
or we can allocate resources

771
01:06:40.415 --> 01:06:42.335
to create new mental health facilities

772
01:06:42.335 --> 01:06:43.655
or wellness centers in these schools.

773
01:06:46.155 --> 01:06:47.455
And we do understand

774
01:06:47.565 --> 01:06:50.095
that there are gonna be budget cuts this school year

775
01:06:50.095 --> 01:06:53.495
because, um, we do understand

776
01:06:53.495 --> 01:06:54.815
that there will be budget cuts,

777
01:06:55.075 --> 01:06:56.695
and we've thought of ways

778
01:06:56.695 --> 01:06:58.295
that we could help fund these ideas

779
01:06:58.295 --> 01:06:59.335
that we've brought forward.

780
01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:02.175
We thought of the Dublin Unified Mental Health Fund.

781
01:07:02.635 --> 01:07:05.845
We understand that, um,

782
01:07:06.275 --> 01:07:08.885
this might be a big task to take on,

783
01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:11.045
but we also understand that this is necessary in order

784
01:07:11.045 --> 01:07:12.045
for our students to thrive.

785
01:07:12.665 --> 01:07:14.405
Um, that's why we're asking for it.

786
01:07:14.945 --> 01:07:16.605
So, 75%

787
01:07:16.705 --> 01:07:19.805
of small businesses across the US actually

788
01:07:19.805 --> 01:07:21.165
donate to local charities.

789
01:07:21.665 --> 01:07:25.085
Um, and this is because they get tax exemptions, write-offs,

790
01:07:25.545 --> 01:07:28.205
um, bus, it helps business state sustainability

791
01:07:28.205 --> 01:07:29.405
and builds company image.

792
01:07:29.985 --> 01:07:34.945
And with over 1.7 million businesses operating in

793
01:07:34.945 --> 01:07:37.385
California, that gives us a lot of options

794
01:07:37.445 --> 01:07:38.985
to look at private funding.

795
01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:42.975
So we understand that since Dublin

796
01:07:43.485 --> 01:07:46.695
Unified is a public school, hopefully we'd be able to have,

797
01:07:47.195 --> 01:07:50.375
um, a lot of businesses, um, donating to our,

798
01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:52.815
our school district as a nonprofit fund.

799
01:07:53.395 --> 01:07:57.395
Um, and also with over, um,

800
01:07:57.575 --> 01:08:00.995
$36.55 billion being donated

801
01:08:01.055 --> 01:08:04.715
by corporations into nonprofits, um, within the year

802
01:08:04.715 --> 01:08:05.875
of just 2023.

803
01:08:06.135 --> 01:08:07.395
We see this as a great

804
01:08:07.655 --> 01:08:11.195
and tremendous opportunity for local businesses to be able

805
01:08:11.195 --> 01:08:12.795
to sponsor our district

806
01:08:13.135 --> 01:08:16.725
and help uplift our mental health, um, for all students.

807
01:08:17.175 --> 01:08:18.175
Thank you.

808
01:08:23.095 --> 01:08:24.155
All right. Thank you. And then

809
01:08:24.155 --> 01:08:25.315
did you wanna present anything?

810
01:08:26.265 --> 01:08:28.185
Okay. Um,

811
01:08:28.185 --> 01:08:30.145
are there any questions from trustees at this point?

812
01:08:30.185 --> 01:08:31.265
I, we, and there is a resolution,

813
01:08:31.265 --> 01:08:33.025
I believe also by Trustee Speck.

814
01:08:34.115 --> 01:08:35.305
Thank you for coming.

815
01:08:35.565 --> 01:08:37.585
Um, thank you for your passion around this topic.

816
01:08:37.725 --> 01:08:39.105
Um, it's great to have students here.

817
01:08:39.765 --> 01:08:42.705
Um, I did have one question, which maybe is more

818
01:08:42.725 --> 01:08:43.905
for Superintendent Funk.

819
01:08:43.905 --> 01:08:45.585
Do we have a wellness center at Emerald?

820
01:08:47.285 --> 01:08:49.425
We have a wellness center at Emerald

821
01:08:49.805 --> 01:08:53.425
and at some of our elementary schools that have, um,

822
01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:55.025
classrooms available,

823
01:08:55.025 --> 01:08:57.905
they've turned their classroom into a wellness center.

824
01:08:58.255 --> 01:09:00.305
Okay. Not the same level as the high school. Sure.

825
01:09:00.405 --> 01:09:02.705
Uh, but certainly they've identified rooms

826
01:09:02.715 --> 01:09:03.825
where students can go

827
01:09:04.165 --> 01:09:06.225
and receive mental health support. Okay.

828
01:09:06.585 --> 01:09:07.545
I thought that I had heard that

829
01:09:07.545 --> 01:09:08.505
when we were on the Emerald tour.

830
01:09:08.805 --> 01:09:13.615
Um, so, um, also,

831
01:09:13.715 --> 01:09:15.295
um, so it was a great presentation.

832
01:09:15.295 --> 01:09:16.735
Just there were a few numbers off.

833
01:09:16.735 --> 01:09:19.095
So I think you're about 2,800 at Dublin High.

834
01:09:19.595 --> 01:09:21.575
Um, so I think you were stated a little over 4,000,

835
01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:22.575
but it's about 2,800.

836
01:09:23.195 --> 01:09:25.255
And then, um, I believe the counselor

837
01:09:25.255 --> 01:09:26.535
ratio is one to four 10.

838
01:09:26.915 --> 01:09:27.915
Is that accurate?

839
01:09:28.985 --> 01:09:30.645
So the, yeah.

840
01:09:30.705 --> 01:09:32.525
Of mental health counselor, but the counselor,

841
01:09:32.525 --> 01:09:33.925
and when you look at the presentation, it's important

842
01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:37.325
that we identify whether it's our academic counselors,

843
01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:41.125
which fall within the CBA limit and it's one to four 50.

844
01:09:41.465 --> 01:09:43.685
But if you look at our mental health counselors Sure.

845
01:09:44.025 --> 01:09:45.285
And the number of students, then

846
01:09:45.285 --> 01:09:47.125
that is higher, a higher ratio. Okay.

847
01:09:47.275 --> 01:09:48.285
Okay. Um,

848
01:09:48.315 --> 01:09:49.765
just wanna make sure we're all

849
01:09:49.765 --> 01:09:50.845
talking the right, same numbers.

850
01:09:51.505 --> 01:09:55.725
Um, I had a question on the resolution.

851
01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:56.965
Do we wanna take those now

852
01:09:56.965 --> 01:09:59.565
or did we wanna just have questions on the presentation?

853
01:09:59.745 --> 01:10:01.005
Um, I think they're all kind of related,

854
01:10:01.025 --> 01:10:02.445
so I think we can go Okay. To that one

855
01:10:02.445 --> 01:10:03.445
As well. Um, so

856
01:10:03.445 --> 01:10:05.365
on the resolution, um,

857
01:10:05.365 --> 01:10:09.885
the third paragraph states two different ratios, one

858
01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:11.805
to 500, and then one to two 50.

859
01:10:11.945 --> 01:10:14.525
And it sounds like general not specific to Dublin.

860
01:10:14.525 --> 01:10:17.445
So I didn't really understand the difference.

861
01:10:17.905 --> 01:10:20.205
Um, and the second

862
01:10:20.385 --> 01:10:22.005
or the rest of them really talked about

863
01:10:22.325 --> 01:10:23.365
specifics about Dublin.

864
01:10:23.905 --> 01:10:28.205
Um, but this one was more of a general, so can you help me

865
01:10:28.235 --> 01:10:32.085
with, um, yeah, if it's getting up there on the screen,

866
01:10:32.915 --> 01:10:34.805
what the difference was between them?

867
01:10:36.835 --> 01:10:41.215
Um, one of the ones that we initially found was the one

868
01:10:41.215 --> 01:10:44.975
to 500, um, for mental health counselors.

869
01:10:45.035 --> 01:10:49.465
And then one of them was for, um, uh,

870
01:10:49.655 --> 01:10:52.025
just typical academic counselors.

871
01:10:52.485 --> 01:10:56.865
We did initially have a ratio for school psychologists.

872
01:10:57.485 --> 01:11:00.945
So as this was being modified, it may have turned out that,

873
01:11:01.365 --> 01:11:03.065
um, just along the chain of command,

874
01:11:03.065 --> 01:11:04.105
something might have happened.

875
01:11:04.445 --> 01:11:07.185
But we initially did have information about mental health

876
01:11:07.185 --> 01:11:11.105
counselors, um, academic counselors, as well as, um,

877
01:11:11.285 --> 01:11:13.025
the school psychologist ratios.

878
01:11:13.595 --> 01:11:17.085
Okay. So, I, I would just say for me,

879
01:11:17.085 --> 01:11:19.085
the way it's written now, I don't really like,

880
01:11:19.405 --> 01:11:20.885
I can't understand that like the one

881
01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:22.045
to 500 was mental health

882
01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:25.285
and the one to two 50 was the other.

883
01:11:25.565 --> 01:11:27.165
'cause they both just say counselor to student.

884
01:11:27.945 --> 01:11:31.715
Um, And I,

885
01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:33.675
I think my recommendation would probably be just

886
01:11:33.695 --> 01:11:36.355
to more talk about like what Dublin has as a ratio and,

887
01:11:36.535 --> 01:11:40.035
and even maybe wording around how, how difficult that is.

888
01:11:40.615 --> 01:11:42.635
Um, you know, while we, we have,

889
01:11:43.375 --> 01:11:44.675
you know, the ratios that we have.

890
01:11:45.215 --> 01:11:47.995
Um, and, and that's a lot of students for one counselor.

891
01:11:47.995 --> 01:11:50.195
And so I think what we're, what you're trying

892
01:11:50.475 --> 01:11:52.235
to get right from this is just, you know,

893
01:11:52.245 --> 01:11:54.915
we're in a situation and we need to, we need to make sure

894
01:11:54.915 --> 01:11:56.075
that we're prioritizing it.

895
01:11:56.215 --> 01:11:58.835
So I think it might be a little more powerful if we,

896
01:11:58.855 --> 01:12:02.235
if we speak about what our, um, ratio is

897
01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:06.515
and then how, um, how we need to just, you know, not necess

898
01:12:06.935 --> 01:12:08.475
as much as we would love to improve

899
01:12:08.475 --> 01:12:09.995
that ratio that costs money.

900
01:12:10.255 --> 01:12:12.315
Um, and that's not situation we're in this year.

901
01:12:12.615 --> 01:12:13.995
Um, but what other things can we do?

902
01:12:13.995 --> 01:12:16.715
And you had some great suggestions in the presentation, so,

903
01:12:17.095 --> 01:12:19.315
um, that was the only one I would, I would love

904
01:12:19.315 --> 01:12:20.555
to see some tweaks too, just

905
01:12:20.555 --> 01:12:22.755
to make sure it's a little clear, um, for us.

906
01:12:23.245 --> 01:12:26.075
Thank you Trustee Buck.

907
01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:28.115
Okay. Thank you for the presentation.

908
01:12:28.775 --> 01:12:30.875
Um, I firmly believe mental health is important,

909
01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:33.115
but I also am going to provide you with some information

910
01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.395
to ask you some questions about things

911
01:12:34.395 --> 01:12:36.035
that I also am gonna push back

912
01:12:36.265 --> 01:12:37.515
because it's important that we

913
01:12:37.515 --> 01:12:38.635
be really accurate and precise.

914
01:12:38.975 --> 01:12:41.315
So I appreciate trustee, um, spec's comments.

915
01:12:42.175 --> 01:12:43.915
We actually are going to be presented

916
01:12:43.915 --> 01:12:46.115
with some data later on today, a data walk.

917
01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:49.435
And in that document it actually shows a system we use

918
01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:52.115
called bark to track conversations with students

919
01:12:52.115 --> 01:12:55.195
with certain topics come up in that system.

920
01:12:55.295 --> 01:12:59.595
It points to over the course of 20 21, 22, that topics

921
01:12:59.735 --> 01:13:01.875
and discussions about depression and self-harm.

922
01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:06.195
For example, um, there were 688 um, instances.

923
01:13:06.695 --> 01:13:08.835
The following year there was 1,240,

924
01:13:09.615 --> 01:13:12.155
but then last year was only, um, 72.

925
01:13:13.295 --> 01:13:16.195
So we've had a severe drop in actual instances where

926
01:13:16.195 --> 01:13:17.835
that kind of conversation is feeding

927
01:13:17.835 --> 01:13:18.955
through our student body.

928
01:13:19.845 --> 01:13:22.665
So I wanna preface some of the data sets

929
01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:23.825
that you're providing us with.

930
01:13:24.585 --> 01:13:27.785
I will always go back to where are they relevant

931
01:13:27.785 --> 01:13:28.985
to actual Dublin,

932
01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.945
because we can get hyped up on a lot

933
01:13:31.945 --> 01:13:33.385
of things occurring across the country.

934
01:13:33.605 --> 01:13:35.065
But Dublin's a very unique place.

935
01:13:35.345 --> 01:13:37.665
I appreciate the comments about certain groups not feeling

936
01:13:37.665 --> 01:13:40.505
that they can access help and assistance.

937
01:13:40.505 --> 01:13:42.305
And I think that's a very interesting point to make.

938
01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:46.025
But to be able to support a resolution like this, it has

939
01:13:46.025 --> 01:13:50.745
to be grounded in Dublin, not, um, examples nationwide.

940
01:13:50.965 --> 01:13:53.985
Uh, we know that high levels of, um, depression

941
01:13:54.205 --> 01:13:56.065
and suicide exist in the southeast.

942
01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:57.705
That's the largest, the highest counts.

943
01:13:57.705 --> 01:14:01.025
California is actually one of the lowest instances

944
01:14:01.165 --> 01:14:04.785
of this in the United States and our number and data sets.

945
01:14:04.885 --> 01:14:06.065
You can go to the CDC

946
01:14:06.065 --> 01:14:08.465
and pull up all the data about the specific numbers

947
01:14:08.725 --> 01:14:09.905
for student body groups

948
01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:13.905
and the age groups of, um, 10 to 14 years old.

949
01:14:13.965 --> 01:14:17.105
The instance of actual suicide, for example,

950
01:14:17.105 --> 01:14:20.345
that would be an extreme case is 2.4

951
01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:22.105
individuals out of a hundred thousand.

952
01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:24.705
So you can multiply that based on the number

953
01:14:24.705 --> 01:14:25.905
of students we have in those age groups

954
01:14:26.285 --> 01:14:30.265
and it equates to half a student at best per year actually

955
01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:32.345
getting to that point, which we hope would never happen.

956
01:14:33.285 --> 01:14:36.065
But, um, actually it's far less than that.

957
01:14:36.065 --> 01:14:37.905
But for the 15 to 24-year-old group,

958
01:14:37.905 --> 01:14:39.065
it actually gets a little bit higher,

959
01:14:39.645 --> 01:14:42.305
but the numbers are still extraordinarily low.

960
01:14:42.405 --> 01:14:44.865
So one of the things I like when you bring a resolution

961
01:14:44.865 --> 01:14:47.145
forward, it needs to be grounded in the dataset saying

962
01:14:47.145 --> 01:14:49.625
that we are providing services at this level.

963
01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:51.745
If we have data that shows

964
01:14:51.745 --> 01:14:53.145
that students are being turned away,

965
01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:56.345
that would be an important point for us to understand so

966
01:14:56.345 --> 01:14:57.905
that we could realize that we are actually

967
01:14:57.915 --> 01:14:59.625
short services for those students.

968
01:15:00.465 --> 01:15:01.665
I would love to see more data

969
01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:02.785
and information about the number

970
01:15:02.785 --> 01:15:04.625
of students we actually see in our wellness center.

971
01:15:05.365 --> 01:15:09.665
And if we have data that shows that those needs are starting

972
01:15:09.725 --> 01:15:12.145
to stem or reduce, then it means

973
01:15:12.145 --> 01:15:14.065
that we've been successful at helping those students.

974
01:15:14.605 --> 01:15:17.385
If we have a high number of referrals, for example, to

975
01:15:17.385 --> 01:15:20.145
outside groups, our county has an enormous number

976
01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:22.425
of services for individuals living in our community.

977
01:15:23.215 --> 01:15:25.265
Huge, massive. And we do a really good job

978
01:15:25.265 --> 01:15:27.225
of referring some students to them, showing

979
01:15:27.285 --> 01:15:28.985
how many students we actually refer to them.

980
01:15:28.985 --> 01:15:31.345
Because those cases are so extreme and severe

981
01:15:31.345 --> 01:15:33.625
and such greater need, we can't accommodate the students.

982
01:15:34.685 --> 01:15:37.025
I'm also a little concerned with us taking on the idea

983
01:15:37.025 --> 01:15:40.905
that we are a mental health center if we believe that,

984
01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:42.185
I think we're in the wrong business.

985
01:15:42.195 --> 01:15:43.545
We're an educational facility

986
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.625
and we need to be really cautious

987
01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.185
and careful when we actually say

988
01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:48.345
we're going to help students.

989
01:15:49.285 --> 01:15:51.745
We may get ourselves into a situation where we are

990
01:15:51.745 --> 01:15:54.225
beyond our capacity to actually serve them

991
01:15:54.355 --> 01:15:55.945
where they need the services.

992
01:15:56.495 --> 01:15:58.545
It's our duty to refer them to the experts

993
01:15:58.685 --> 01:16:01.305
who can really do the great need of help and support them.

994
01:16:02.045 --> 01:16:03.345
So I appreciate that we,

995
01:16:03.365 --> 01:16:04.945
you're saying let's bring this forward.

996
01:16:05.065 --> 01:16:07.185
I think we're doing a really good job is what's pointed out.

997
01:16:07.565 --> 01:16:09.345
But I also would like this updated

998
01:16:09.445 --> 01:16:12.345
to reflect the specifics of Dublin.

999
01:16:12.765 --> 01:16:15.665
If we do not have a wellness center at a campus,

1000
01:16:15.985 --> 01:16:18.585
I would love that to be presented in the resolution so

1001
01:16:18.585 --> 01:16:20.465
that something we could look at supporting.

1002
01:16:21.045 --> 01:16:22.985
If there are specific numbers that show

1003
01:16:22.985 --> 01:16:24.265
where we have greater need

1004
01:16:24.285 --> 01:16:26.345
and we cannot accommodate are returning away students,

1005
01:16:26.735 --> 01:16:28.745
that would be a great argument for us to look at.

1006
01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:31.705
How do we expand the supports that we have?

1007
01:16:31.805 --> 01:16:33.065
Do we need additional hires?

1008
01:16:33.065 --> 01:16:34.305
Do we need to move people around?

1009
01:16:34.745 --> 01:16:36.025
I think those would be great arguments.

1010
01:16:37.265 --> 01:16:40.105
I appreciate the energy and the enthusiasm behind this,

1011
01:16:40.285 --> 01:16:43.305
but it has to be grounded in real information data.

1012
01:16:44.025 --> 01:16:46.025
I wanna applaud the staff that we have

1013
01:16:46.025 --> 01:16:48.505
because I believe over the last few years they've done an

1014
01:16:48.505 --> 01:16:51.345
incredible job actually providing

1015
01:16:52.255 --> 01:16:54.965
after school evening presentations,

1016
01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:56.645
outreach with family groups.

1017
01:16:57.365 --> 01:16:58.885
I love that they do a lot of this

1018
01:16:58.885 --> 01:17:00.285
and advertise the families to come in

1019
01:17:00.285 --> 01:17:01.965
and learn about this so they can help their own children.

1020
01:17:02.805 --> 01:17:04.525
I think we've done a great job in pairing

1021
01:17:04.525 --> 01:17:07.525
and working with some of our outer resources for the county.

1022
01:17:07.895 --> 01:17:10.765
Those are fantastic. There's some resources prevented

1023
01:17:10.765 --> 01:17:13.165
by the city and we've teamed with them.

1024
01:17:13.305 --> 01:17:14.885
So I I think there's a lot being done.

1025
01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:17.805
So I wanna encourage you, I would actually,

1026
01:17:18.025 --> 01:17:20.165
I'm gonna make an ask that we actually bring this back

1027
01:17:20.165 --> 01:17:23.165
with a little bit more detail relevant to Dublin

1028
01:17:23.345 --> 01:17:24.925
and finesse it a little bit more.

1029
01:17:25.205 --> 01:17:27.965
I would like to see us having more specifics of the gaps

1030
01:17:27.965 --> 01:17:30.245
that we need before we actually approve a resolution.

1031
01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:34.285
Because my fear right now is we have a budget

1032
01:17:35.385 --> 01:17:38.495
issue at hand and we can't make any promises

1033
01:17:38.635 --> 01:17:42.495
and aspects of this document hint at doing certain things

1034
01:17:42.495 --> 01:17:43.935
that I don't believe we can actually make

1035
01:17:43.935 --> 01:17:45.055
commitments to it this time.

1036
01:17:45.555 --> 01:17:48.335
So I appreciate your enthusiasm and,

1037
01:17:48.355 --> 01:17:49.735
but I would like this to come back

1038
01:17:49.735 --> 01:17:52.095
with a little bit more fine grain detail specific

1039
01:17:52.715 --> 01:17:55.295
to what's going on in Dublin so we can make a better, um,

1040
01:17:55.615 --> 01:17:57.575
resolutions more specific to our district.

1041
01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:58.745
Thank you.

1042
01:17:59.235 --> 01:18:01.095
Um, I just wanna, uh, do then Dr.

1043
01:18:01.235 --> 01:18:04.455
Or trustee chair, I do wanna clarify, we did update

1044
01:18:05.075 --> 01:18:09.855
the absence, um, ar in 2023

1045
01:18:10.015 --> 01:18:11.935
'cause IIII went and checked just

1046
01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:14.135
'cause I I remember talking about it.

1047
01:18:14.755 --> 01:18:16.415
Um, so it's not in the board policy,

1048
01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.775
which might have been what you looked at.

1049
01:18:17.795 --> 01:18:18.895
It didn't specifically say it,

1050
01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:22.775
but the ar which is like how this is all way up here, Steph,

1051
01:18:22.775 --> 01:18:25.695
but it's basically how we implement it does reference

1052
01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:28.215
personal illness including absence for the benefit

1053
01:18:28.315 --> 01:18:29.935
of the student's mental or behavioral health.

1054
01:18:31.045 --> 01:18:33.505
So, um, the board policy does reference following ed code

1055
01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:35.865
and then in the AR it does reference that.

1056
01:18:36.025 --> 01:18:38.705
'cause I, I felt like I remembered that we had just done,

1057
01:18:39.445 --> 01:18:40.905
um, stuff on absences.

1058
01:18:40.905 --> 01:18:44.905
So I did check and that was updated in, um, April of 2023.

1059
01:18:45.565 --> 01:18:47.505
So we were on it for something.

1060
01:18:48.645 --> 01:18:50.105
Um, so maybe we can just clarify that so

1061
01:18:50.105 --> 01:18:51.145
that there might be some few things

1062
01:18:51.145 --> 01:18:53.145
and maybe we could probably, maybe some written feedback,

1063
01:18:53.685 --> 01:18:56.665
um, that we could go through, um, trustee wan, um,

1064
01:18:56.975 --> 01:18:58.145
regarding some things in

1065
01:18:58.165 --> 01:19:00.305
and you guys could kind of collaborate with that.

1066
01:19:00.405 --> 01:19:01.625
So, um, and trustee chair.

1067
01:19:02.475 --> 01:19:06.385
Thank you. Are are we on, uh, we're doing both advocacy

1068
01:19:06.525 --> 01:19:07.945
and questions at this point?

1069
01:19:07.945 --> 01:19:12.145
Yeah. Oh, okay. Um, yeah, uh,

1070
01:19:12.245 --> 01:19:15.585
my first question is have we run this by general counsel?

1071
01:19:18.065 --> 01:19:20.005
Did you guys happen to call up our attorneys

1072
01:19:20.105 --> 01:19:21.205
and run it by general counsel?

1073
01:19:21.905 --> 01:19:25.375
No. When he wrote the resolution? No, they did not.

1074
01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:27.895
And neither did staff. Okay.

1075
01:19:28.395 --> 01:19:31.885
My concern, you know, I think it's a great idea

1076
01:19:31.945 --> 01:19:33.325
and I, I'm all for mental health.

1077
01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:37.765
I, it did, it's just we have a lot of, um,

1078
01:19:38.845 --> 01:19:42.405
absolutes in here are like all, all, um,

1079
01:19:42.735 --> 01:19:43.805
staff and everything.

1080
01:19:43.985 --> 01:19:47.485
And if the really

1081
01:19:48.165 --> 01:19:49.725
horrible thing should happen,

1082
01:19:51.035 --> 01:19:52.965
someone could pull this resolution up

1083
01:19:52.965 --> 01:19:55.085
and say, Hey, you committed to doing all this stuff

1084
01:19:55.085 --> 01:19:57.125
and you guys didn't, and you're liable.

1085
01:19:58.345 --> 01:20:02.725
So I, I think this needs to come back to us,

1086
01:20:04.505 --> 01:20:08.285
uh, after having been reviewed by an attorney with

1087
01:20:09.185 --> 01:20:12.925
an eye to, to, to not, not totally reducing,

1088
01:20:13.105 --> 01:20:17.365
but minimizing, uh, district liability.

1089
01:20:19.265 --> 01:20:22.045
Uh, and then, uh, perhaps we could,

1090
01:20:22.345 --> 01:20:24.885
uh, we could pass.

1091
01:20:25.005 --> 01:20:26.605
I, I mean I'm all for the idea.

1092
01:20:27.185 --> 01:20:32.005
I'm just worried that we could have some some pretty

1093
01:20:32.515 --> 01:20:36.285
serious claims against, against the district based on this.

1094
01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:40.525
And I just want to have the assurance that we've minimized

1095
01:20:40.525 --> 01:20:41.965
that to the extent possible.

1096
01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:43.725
Thank you.

1097
01:20:45.235 --> 01:20:48.975
So I would, um, and so don't, don't take this personally.

1098
01:20:49.035 --> 01:20:51.495
You know, we, we, we send lots of resolutions back.

1099
01:20:51.495 --> 01:20:53.455
We, we discuss lots of things. We do this all the time.

1100
01:20:53.455 --> 01:20:54.775
You probably don't watch all these meetings.

1101
01:20:55.515 --> 01:20:58.615
Um, so I would recommend any board member

1102
01:20:58.615 --> 01:21:02.375
that has a specific, um, kind of feedback, whatever

1103
01:21:02.435 --> 01:21:04.015
to email, um, run it.

1104
01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:06.415
Um, and we can kind of facilitate through that

1105
01:21:06.435 --> 01:21:08.095
and then he can coordinate with you guys

1106
01:21:08.275 --> 01:21:10.535
and then potentially work at, at bringing it back.

1107
01:21:10.535 --> 01:21:11.975
Because I do think it is an important thing and,

1108
01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:13.215
but I do wanna make sure that

1109
01:21:13.215 --> 01:21:14.415
we're getting everything correct.

1110
01:21:15.315 --> 01:21:17.295
Um, and, and maybe kind of updating.

1111
01:21:17.955 --> 01:21:19.735
Um, so it may not be listed on a website

1112
01:21:19.735 --> 01:21:22.375
that we have a wellness center that, but, but we might.

1113
01:21:22.435 --> 01:21:24.495
And so maybe kind of getting some feedback, um,

1114
01:21:24.495 --> 01:21:27.295
from the different sites so we can really kinda target,

1115
01:21:27.635 --> 01:21:30.175
target those types of things. But

1116
01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:33.575
Yeah, and I just add that, um, there, there,

1117
01:21:33.715 --> 01:21:36.455
for me there's just a disconnect between the presentation

1118
01:21:36.895 --> 01:21:41.135
'cause that had information that was national versus Dublin

1119
01:21:41.135 --> 01:21:43.335
and I had a hard time figuring out the difference.

1120
01:21:43.905 --> 01:21:47.495
There was some information that was incomplete, um,

1121
01:21:47.795 --> 01:21:48.895
or hadn't been updated.

1122
01:21:49.595 --> 01:21:52.495
Uh, but if you look at the bullets in the resolution,

1123
01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:54.735
all those bullets are something as a,

1124
01:21:54.795 --> 01:21:57.495
as your superintendent, I support wholeheartedly.

1125
01:21:58.035 --> 01:22:00.935
Um, uh, there's no commitment

1126
01:22:00.935 --> 01:22:03.655
that we will have a wellness center at every single

1127
01:22:03.725 --> 01:22:04.735
site by certain date.

1128
01:22:05.275 --> 01:22:08.335
Um, a lot of that will be based on the enrollment

1129
01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:10.775
of a school and whether a school has capacity.

1130
01:22:11.395 --> 01:22:15.975
Um, I believe that we could always do a better job of, uh,

1131
01:22:15.975 --> 01:22:19.975
increasing the amount of training we provide our, our staff

1132
01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.495
and our, our our students and parents.

1133
01:22:23.235 --> 01:22:26.135
Um, and so I think we can revise this, uh,

1134
01:22:26.395 --> 01:22:29.335
and come to a place where we can all feel comfortable.

1135
01:22:29.915 --> 01:22:33.775
Um, I just wanna separate, uh, the comment about Bark.

1136
01:22:33.965 --> 01:22:36.775
Bark is a different reporting system.

1137
01:22:36.915 --> 01:22:40.895
It has nothing to do with this mental health resolution, uh,

1138
01:22:40.895 --> 01:22:45.135
because it's all based on writings of students that, uh,

1139
01:22:45.795 --> 01:22:47.495
key words are triggered to us.

1140
01:22:48.075 --> 01:22:51.135
Uh, we had over 2000 students visit our mental health

1141
01:22:51.935 --> 01:22:53.495
facility in many cases.

1142
01:22:54.315 --> 01:22:57.695
Uh, it's just a place for a student to be able

1143
01:22:57.835 --> 01:23:00.135
to decompress, to reconnect

1144
01:23:00.135 --> 01:23:01.855
before they go back to the next class.

1145
01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:04.495
It's an opportunity for small groups

1146
01:23:04.655 --> 01:23:06.285
supports, uh, to take place.

1147
01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:10.365
And it is also a place to be referred to a clinician.

1148
01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:13.445
Uh, the reason you have a wellness center is

1149
01:23:13.445 --> 01:23:16.285
that you bring the conditions onto the campus so

1150
01:23:16.285 --> 01:23:18.925
that kids can get immediate, immediate support.

1151
01:23:19.185 --> 01:23:22.645
So we may not be in the business of, um,

1152
01:23:23.785 --> 01:23:25.645
of mental health per se,

1153
01:23:25.905 --> 01:23:28.925
but to say that schools should not provide mental health

1154
01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:33.205
support, um, it it it's no longer a stigma

1155
01:23:33.345 --> 01:23:36.125
to have mental health counseling on your campuses.

1156
01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:39.005
And so I think we can bring this back in a way

1157
01:23:39.005 --> 01:23:40.645
that can benefit the district

1158
01:23:40.825 --> 01:23:42.925
and get full support from the board.

1159
01:23:44.795 --> 01:23:47.655
Um, if, if I may, I really do appreciate

1160
01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:48.895
that superintendent funk.

1161
01:23:49.275 --> 01:23:50.695
Um, this personally is something

1162
01:23:50.695 --> 01:23:52.135
that's really near dear to my heart.

1163
01:23:52.455 --> 01:23:55.935
'cause I'm one of those kids who has parents who don't agree

1164
01:23:55.935 --> 01:23:58.575
with me receiving treatment, which is why I'm pushing

1165
01:23:58.755 --> 01:23:59.775
so firmly for it.

1166
01:24:00.395 --> 01:24:02.895
Um, like you said, I was referred to Hume

1167
01:24:03.115 --> 01:24:04.855
and that might've saved my life

1168
01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:06.175
my freshman and sophomore year.

1169
01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:10.055
So that's why we're pushing so dearly for this.

1170
01:24:10.115 --> 01:24:11.375
And I just wanna say thank you.

1171
01:24:16.075 --> 01:24:19.385
Thank you. All right. Thank you.

1172
01:24:23.505 --> 01:24:27.105
All righty. Next up we have another re

1173
01:24:27.785 --> 01:24:30.985
resolution discussing the notice of vacancy

1174
01:24:31.015 --> 01:24:34.225
that will be occurring in area tr area three.

1175
01:24:36.085 --> 01:24:37.425
Are you presenting on this or?

1176
01:24:38.175 --> 01:24:40.545
Well, I, I, I can just kick it off,

1177
01:24:40.685 --> 01:24:42.865
but it's really for the board's discussion.

1178
01:24:42.965 --> 01:24:46.425
As the board knows, we had, uh, two areas, area one

1179
01:24:46.425 --> 01:24:51.025
and area three that were open for, um, elections as well

1180
01:24:51.025 --> 01:24:54.675
as area um, four, uh,

1181
01:24:54.745 --> 01:24:56.595
area four was unopposed.

1182
01:24:56.665 --> 01:24:58.195
Area three was unopposed.

1183
01:24:58.315 --> 01:25:01.075
'cause one person pulled papers in time, uh,

1184
01:25:01.255 --> 01:25:03.235
for the ballots, uh, to be printed.

1185
01:25:03.575 --> 01:25:05.675
And then area one had two candidates.

1186
01:25:06.265 --> 01:25:08.075
Unfortunately, the candidate

1187
01:25:08.075 --> 01:25:10.755
for area three has submitted their resignation.

1188
01:25:11.255 --> 01:25:13.115
Uh, life happens, things changed.

1189
01:25:13.455 --> 01:25:16.915
And, uh, that candidate is unable to fulfill their duties.

1190
01:25:17.855 --> 01:25:21.675
And so before you, tonight is a resolution, uh,

1191
01:25:21.895 --> 01:25:23.395
for a provisional appointment.

1192
01:25:23.935 --> 01:25:27.275
Um, what you have on there is the actual resolution.

1193
01:25:27.775 --> 01:25:32.635
In the memo, you have the link to board bylaw 92 23,

1194
01:25:32.635 --> 01:25:35.355
which is the board updated I think last month.

1195
01:25:36.135 --> 01:25:40.115
Uh, you have the resignation letter from Mr. Clark,

1196
01:25:41.015 --> 01:25:42.995
and then you have the application

1197
01:25:43.215 --> 01:25:45.475
to fill the board vacancy if the board passes

1198
01:25:45.715 --> 01:25:46.755
a resolution tonight.

1199
01:25:47.495 --> 01:25:51.455
Um, and so, um, I think there's two things

1200
01:25:51.475 --> 01:25:52.975
for the board to consider tonight.

1201
01:25:53.115 --> 01:25:55.255
One is whether or not to approve the resolution.

1202
01:25:55.875 --> 01:25:57.295
And then two, whether

1203
01:25:57.315 --> 01:25:59.695
or not if the board approves the resolution

1204
01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:03.965
for the provisional appointment, does the board do the, uh,

1205
01:26:03.995 --> 01:26:08.205
interview, uh, and the appointment on December 17th?

1206
01:26:08.985 --> 01:26:11.125
Or do we try to find a date prior

1207
01:26:11.145 --> 01:26:12.685
to the first board meeting in January

1208
01:26:13.265 --> 01:26:16.805
to have a special board meeting, uh, for the,

1209
01:26:17.025 --> 01:26:18.125
um, appointment process.

1210
01:26:18.545 --> 01:26:21.765
So those are the two things that, uh, I think's important

1211
01:26:21.765 --> 01:26:23.685
for the, uh, the board to consider this evening.

1212
01:26:25.535 --> 01:26:27.625
Trustee chair. Thank you.

1213
01:26:27.645 --> 01:26:30.105
Are we doing both questions? And, and yeah.

1214
01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:32.145
I think this is gonna be a yeah. Discussion kind of.

1215
01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:35.785
There's, um, I, I have,

1216
01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:41.085
I, I guess I have a little, couple issues with this.

1217
01:26:41.585 --> 01:26:45.085
Um, is is one is

1218
01:26:47.655 --> 01:26:49.705
technically right now there's not a vacancy.

1219
01:26:50.825 --> 01:26:54.175
There is, um, there's someone that pulled papers.

1220
01:26:55.605 --> 01:26:59.735
They, the election will be certified in 20 days

1221
01:26:59.795 --> 01:27:03.335
or something, and then we certify it again on the 17th.

1222
01:27:05.035 --> 01:27:08.535
Um, a pers So there's nothing

1223
01:27:09.745 --> 01:27:12.805
to resign from immediately.

1224
01:27:13.185 --> 01:27:17.485
Um, and when that person submits a resignation letter,

1225
01:27:18.425 --> 01:27:21.325
it has to be submitted to the superintendent

1226
01:27:21.325 --> 01:27:22.805
of education for the county.

1227
01:27:23.945 --> 01:27:26.965
The, the, the letter you attached was directed

1228
01:27:26.965 --> 01:27:30.725
to the superintendent of Dublin Unified, which isn't

1229
01:27:30.725 --> 01:27:32.085
what the rules say to do.

1230
01:27:33.485 --> 01:27:35.145
Um, to me,

1231
01:27:36.615 --> 01:27:41.325
if they had submitted a, which you can do

1232
01:27:41.325 --> 01:27:43.645
that 60 days in advance, you'd say an effective date,

1233
01:27:44.055 --> 01:27:47.245
60 days in the future, if they had,

1234
01:27:48.695 --> 01:27:50.835
if Mr. Clark had submitted a letter

1235
01:27:51.745 --> 01:27:56.285
and submitted that to the, uh,

1236
01:27:56.665 --> 01:27:59.685
superintendent of schools for Alameda County

1237
01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:03.605
and said, effective December 18th,

1238
01:28:04.565 --> 01:28:08.525
I hereby resign as being a trustee of the board

1239
01:28:09.505 --> 01:28:12.845
of, um, double unified, um,

1240
01:28:13.835 --> 01:28:15.805
then I think we could act on that.

1241
01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:20.285
My reading of 5 0 9 1 at Ed Code,

1242
01:28:23.155 --> 01:28:26.095
we haven't met the rules for there to be a vacancy yet.

1243
01:28:26.275 --> 01:28:28.815
And I, I don't th I think this conversation

1244
01:28:30.155 --> 01:28:33.595
at this particular time is premature.

1245
01:28:34.535 --> 01:28:37.315
We haven't, there is no vacancy

1246
01:28:37.505 --> 01:28:39.955
because someone filed papers correctly.

1247
01:28:41.535 --> 01:28:43.875
Uh, they were on the, you know,

1248
01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.475
they weren't on the ballot simply

1249
01:28:45.475 --> 01:28:47.475
because they were the only person that filed.

1250
01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:53.275
They will be shown as the trustee

1251
01:28:54.135 --> 01:28:58.755
as soon as whenever the Alameda County Register of voters

1252
01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:03.205
d does their work and certifies the election.

1253
01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:08.045
Uh, then it's up to us to certify that again on the 17th.

1254
01:29:09.465 --> 01:29:12.445
At that point, the person's very free to resign.

1255
01:29:12.705 --> 01:29:15.285
But, or, and, and like I said, they could resign now,

1256
01:29:15.285 --> 01:29:16.925
but they have to show the effective date

1257
01:29:17.665 --> 01:29:18.805
and it has to be submitted.

1258
01:29:18.805 --> 01:29:22.205
So I I, I don't think I,

1259
01:29:22.325 --> 01:29:25.165
I don't think we can have this conversation right now in,

1260
01:29:25.345 --> 01:29:26.845
in my mind, we have to wait.

1261
01:29:27.505 --> 01:29:31.205
And if he, I would be fine doing this if he had some,

1262
01:29:31.225 --> 01:29:34.445
if Mr. Clark had submitted a letter

1263
01:29:35.465 --> 01:29:37.415
to the superintendent of education

1264
01:29:39.205 --> 01:29:40.975
with an effective date

1265
01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:44.265
after he becomes a trustee.

1266
01:29:44.925 --> 01:29:46.105
But that hasn't happened.

1267
01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:48.265
So I don't believe

1268
01:29:48.845 --> 01:29:50.985
we can do this right now. That's my opinion.

1269
01:29:51.785 --> 01:29:53.285
Has he, have we notified the county

1270
01:29:53.385 --> 01:29:55.485
or what, what happened?

1271
01:29:55.795 --> 01:29:58.845
What was the kind of the procedure and timeline of things?

1272
01:29:59.345 --> 01:30:02.965
So our general counsel, um, from Liz Smith,

1273
01:30:02.965 --> 01:30:05.325
Harold Freeman, uh, walked me through the steps.

1274
01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:09.045
Uh, the board's not taking any action to fill the seat

1275
01:30:09.045 --> 01:30:10.245
because there's no seat to fill.

1276
01:30:10.305 --> 01:30:14.645
You are correct on that. Um, he suggested

1277
01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:19.085
that the, uh, Mr. Clark sent a resignation, uh,

1278
01:30:19.145 --> 01:30:22.725
to the district, uh, announcing that he would not be, um,

1279
01:30:23.345 --> 01:30:25.205
be seated on December 17th.

1280
01:30:25.865 --> 01:30:28.725
So the board cannot take any action on

1281
01:30:28.725 --> 01:30:29.765
filling that position.

1282
01:30:30.225 --> 01:30:31.925
But there's nothing in ed code,

1283
01:30:31.925 --> 01:30:33.485
there's nothing in election code,

1284
01:30:33.485 --> 01:30:34.965
there's nothing in our board policy

1285
01:30:35.035 --> 01:30:37.245
that does not allow the board to start the process

1286
01:30:37.745 --> 01:30:38.845
of announcing it.

1287
01:30:39.545 --> 01:30:42.045
Um, prior to December 17th.

1288
01:30:42.745 --> 01:30:44.965
And so everything that, uh, you have

1289
01:30:44.965 --> 01:30:47.805
before you tonight, it has been vetted by legal counsel,

1290
01:30:50.015 --> 01:30:51.015
Trustee Blackman.

1291
01:30:51.925 --> 01:30:53.955
Thank you for that clarification. I understand.

1292
01:30:54.375 --> 01:30:56.035
Um, I actually also went back

1293
01:30:56.035 --> 01:30:58.035
and looked at our bylaw in 9 2, 2 3.

1294
01:30:58.655 --> 01:31:01.825
Um, and it kind of is pretty clear.

1295
01:31:01.965 --> 01:31:03.225
We actually have to have a vacancy.

1296
01:31:03.685 --> 01:31:06.665
And right now the seat is filled by trustee quo.

1297
01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:09.865
Um, we've actually had this occur in the district

1298
01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:11.265
before where somebody has resigned

1299
01:31:11.605 --> 01:31:13.265
and they've given us an effective date.

1300
01:31:13.285 --> 01:31:15.465
And at that point where the seat was vacant,

1301
01:31:15.685 --> 01:31:17.865
the decision was made to move ahead with either

1302
01:31:18.585 --> 01:31:20.625
a special election or an appointment,

1303
01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:22.145
which I believe is also an option

1304
01:31:22.145 --> 01:31:24.345
that isn't listed on the agenda item at this time.

1305
01:31:25.245 --> 01:31:27.985
But at this point, we actually have somebody in the seat.

1306
01:31:28.005 --> 01:31:30.625
So technically the seat isn't vacant,

1307
01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:32.425
it will be in the future.

1308
01:31:32.605 --> 01:31:36.065
So I understand that, but it would also preclude trustee quo

1309
01:31:36.095 --> 01:31:37.545
from actually voting on it

1310
01:31:37.545 --> 01:31:39.625
because he currently occupies the seat.

1311
01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:42.825
So there's a little bit. My concern is without actually

1312
01:31:42.825 --> 01:31:45.745
having followed what we would do and being through this

1313
01:31:45.745 --> 01:31:48.305
before actually Joe Jeanie stepped down, for example

1314
01:31:48.405 --> 01:31:52.185
and others, is that we've actually set a precedent for

1315
01:31:52.185 --> 01:31:54.745
how we manage, um, vacancies.

1316
01:31:55.365 --> 01:31:56.905
So we would be making an exception.

1317
01:31:57.165 --> 01:32:00.845
Um, I'm a little confused given that this individual,

1318
01:32:00.945 --> 01:32:03.125
Mr. Clark had actually submitted the documents

1319
01:32:03.145 --> 01:32:04.285
on October 16th.

1320
01:32:04.985 --> 01:32:07.445
Um, I, I guess from what he was thinking,

1321
01:32:07.445 --> 01:32:09.165
that he wasn't going to be able to

1322
01:32:09.675 --> 01:32:11.445
fulfill his duties as a trustee.

1323
01:32:12.025 --> 01:32:13.325
So he wanted to get pulled off the ballot,

1324
01:32:13.345 --> 01:32:15.915
but he missed the date, unfortunately,

1325
01:32:17.175 --> 01:32:18.875
by nobody else being on the ballot.

1326
01:32:19.105 --> 01:32:20.115
He's elected a trustee,

1327
01:32:20.495 --> 01:32:22.435
but has to be verified by the county,

1328
01:32:23.095 --> 01:32:25.955
and we have to validate it for him to technically resign.

1329
01:32:26.715 --> 01:32:28.615
So if he wants to resubmit a letter

1330
01:32:29.205 --> 01:32:32.095
that basically gives us a date of vacancy on the 18th,

1331
01:32:32.165 --> 01:32:33.335
that would certainly help.

1332
01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:36.455
And if he followed through with what trustee chair

1333
01:32:36.555 --> 01:32:39.495
or, um, mentioned in filing it

1334
01:32:39.495 --> 01:32:41.295
with the county superintendent,

1335
01:32:41.845 --> 01:32:44.055
that would certainly help clarify anything.

1336
01:32:44.135 --> 01:32:46.855
I would hate to have the community, and they've done this

1337
01:32:46.855 --> 01:32:48.255
before, they've rejected appointments,

1338
01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:51.055
which has been very costly and taking a lot of time.

1339
01:32:51.675 --> 01:32:54.175
Um, so I'd like to make certain

1340
01:32:54.175 --> 01:32:55.975
that we're really following proper procedure,

1341
01:32:56.075 --> 01:32:59.695
but if you read the actual document, 9 2 2 3, which we,

1342
01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:02.695
I believe we approved back in September of this year,

1343
01:33:03.475 --> 01:33:06.415
it does talk about a resignation of a board member.

1344
01:33:06.965 --> 01:33:09.735
Technically speaking, Mr. Clark is not a board member

1345
01:33:09.945 --> 01:33:12.575
until we've actually validated the documents received from

1346
01:33:12.575 --> 01:33:14.335
the state on December 17th.

1347
01:33:16.645 --> 01:33:17.645
So

1348
01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.395
You're, you're absolutely correct on all the points have

1349
01:33:23.395 --> 01:33:27.195
been stated, but the board's not taking action on appointing

1350
01:33:27.775 --> 01:33:32.725
anyone prior to, um, Mr. Clark not being seated.

1351
01:33:32.725 --> 01:33:34.965
It's one thing to verify the election results.

1352
01:33:35.075 --> 01:33:39.325
It's another step to actually seat, uh, the new member.

1353
01:33:39.865 --> 01:33:41.845
And Mr. Clark's made it clear

1354
01:33:41.845 --> 01:33:44.205
that he will not be seated even if the

1355
01:33:44.365 --> 01:33:45.485
elections are certified.

1356
01:33:45.825 --> 01:33:47.485
No, I understand that. But I was looking at our,

1357
01:33:47.485 --> 01:33:48.645
our document from September

1358
01:33:49.225 --> 01:33:51.965
and throughout it, it says, when, when a vacancy occurs,

1359
01:33:52.965 --> 01:33:54.855
when a person has stepped down from the role,

1360
01:33:55.445 --> 01:33:56.615
then we have all these options.

1361
01:33:56.835 --> 01:34:00.095
Mm-Hmm. And, but he's technically not a board member

1362
01:34:00.305 --> 01:34:02.055
until December 17th.

1363
01:34:02.455 --> 01:34:05.575
I mean, the very minute that trustee quo steps down

1364
01:34:05.575 --> 01:34:07.935
and this individual is, we receive the information,

1365
01:34:07.935 --> 01:34:08.975
we approve it, then it's,

1366
01:34:09.395 --> 01:34:11.215
we ratify the information from the county

1367
01:34:11.955 --> 01:34:13.215
and the individual steps down.

1368
01:34:14.095 --> 01:34:16.295
I think at that point, we are authorized by

1369
01:34:16.845 --> 01:34:19.135
what we just approved in September to move forward

1370
01:34:19.135 --> 01:34:21.735
with the ability to decide what we wanna do next,

1371
01:34:21.735 --> 01:34:25.145
which is either an appointment or a special election.

1372
01:34:25.985 --> 01:34:27.555
Both. I, I actually was curious.

1373
01:34:27.575 --> 01:34:30.915
We didn't, um, I didn't see, um,

1374
01:34:32.235 --> 01:34:33.875
a discussion piece here for whether

1375
01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:35.755
or not the board would even want to go

1376
01:34:36.265 --> 01:34:37.715
with a special election.

1377
01:34:37.775 --> 01:34:39.075
It just seems like staff was,

1378
01:34:40.525 --> 01:34:41.995
staff thought it was advisable

1379
01:34:41.995 --> 01:34:44.075
to do an appointment. I was sort of curious

1380
01:34:44.175 --> 01:34:48.115
Why, since, I mean, we literally just had enough filing

1381
01:34:48.135 --> 01:34:51.075
for an election and literally one person filed

1382
01:34:52.445 --> 01:34:53.505
and then has pulled out.

1383
01:34:54.185 --> 01:34:56.065
I mean, I, I don't know.

1384
01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:00.045
I dunno, maybe someone was set forward at this point,

1385
01:35:00.065 --> 01:35:01.605
but I I don't think it's logical.

1386
01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:05.445
And the cost of an election I think would be irresponsible.

1387
01:35:06.145 --> 01:35:08.805
Um, given what we've known to be

1388
01:35:09.985 --> 01:35:11.445
no one applying for an election.

1389
01:35:12.185 --> 01:35:16.695
Um, I think in the past we, we've shown,

1390
01:35:17.235 --> 01:35:20.815
um, more people have put their names forward

1391
01:35:21.635 --> 01:35:23.775
in the appointment process than have filed

1392
01:35:23.835 --> 01:35:25.455
for applied for election.

1393
01:35:26.035 --> 01:35:28.895
Um, I mean, the fact, the fact that n literally no one else,

1394
01:35:29.775 --> 01:35:31.265
like we, we at one point didn't think

1395
01:35:31.265 --> 01:35:32.305
anyone was going to even apply.

1396
01:35:32.985 --> 01:35:37.195
I, um, so I mean,

1397
01:35:37.795 --> 01:35:39.435
I don't know how other board members feel about,

1398
01:35:39.615 --> 01:35:41.075
um, a special election.

1399
01:35:41.195 --> 01:35:43.635
I personally, I think it's a waste of money.

1400
01:35:43.855 --> 01:35:48.005
And when it is very, very likely

1401
01:35:48.005 --> 01:35:49.885
that no one would apply, I think we have a much better

1402
01:35:49.885 --> 01:35:53.055
chance of having someone apply

1403
01:35:53.315 --> 01:35:55.505
to be appointed trustee chair.

1404
01:35:56.625 --> 01:36:01.265
Yeah. Um, historically, uh, I'm not trying

1405
01:36:01.265 --> 01:36:02.425
to give a history lesson here,

1406
01:36:02.605 --> 01:36:05.345
but, um, in the last 14 years,

1407
01:36:05.515 --> 01:36:07.545
we've had six vacancies on this board.

1408
01:36:08.475 --> 01:36:11.705
We've had, uh, Mr. Hobert quit, Mr.

1409
01:36:12.435 --> 01:36:16.225
Kenny quit, Mr. Al quit. Mr.

1410
01:36:17.945 --> 01:36:21.935
Giannini quit. We, there was a petition

1411
01:36:22.035 --> 01:36:23.455
to remove an appointment,

1412
01:36:24.755 --> 01:36:28.935
and, uh, then we had the unfortunate, uh,

1413
01:36:30.665 --> 01:36:33.735
death of a, a trustee, uh, Catherine Crow.

1414
01:36:34.715 --> 01:36:38.735
So those are the six times we've had it.

1415
01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:41.175
The, the first three were all simple appointments,

1416
01:36:41.635 --> 01:36:44.055
and we had a lot of people apply.

1417
01:36:45.595 --> 01:36:50.175
The next time was a, when Mr.

1418
01:36:50.575 --> 01:36:53.655
Giannini left, we had, um,

1419
01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.695
and this was one that was still across the whole city.

1420
01:36:58.395 --> 01:37:01.175
Um, we had, uh,

1421
01:37:02.155 --> 01:37:03.455
uh, Mr.

1422
01:37:03.525 --> 01:37:05.615
Jean quit. We had two people apply.

1423
01:37:06.795 --> 01:37:08.935
Uh, one person was appointed

1424
01:37:09.795 --> 01:37:12.335
and that person was removed as you can do.

1425
01:37:13.895 --> 01:37:17.675
Uh, then, um, when, oh,

1426
01:37:17.695 --> 01:37:20.795
and Mr. Cunningham resigned too, I forgot that one.

1427
01:37:21.175 --> 01:37:26.035
Um, when Mr. Cunningham left, we, uh,

1428
01:37:26.975 --> 01:37:28.475
we took no action.

1429
01:37:28.615 --> 01:37:32.595
And in 60 days later, the, uh, superintendent

1430
01:37:32.595 --> 01:37:34.675
of education called for a special election.

1431
01:37:34.675 --> 01:37:35.795
It was out of our hands at

1432
01:37:35.795 --> 01:37:37.035
that point, and they set the date.

1433
01:37:37.815 --> 01:37:41.955
And then after Catherine Crow, we decided to appoint.

1434
01:37:42.335 --> 01:37:46.355
And we had three people, I believe, apply at that.

1435
01:37:47.815 --> 01:37:50.715
So there is a history of appointments,

1436
01:37:51.535 --> 01:37:53.075
but that's always been a board decision,

1437
01:37:53.215 --> 01:37:57.005
and it's always been something that the, the

1438
01:37:57.225 --> 01:37:59.285
that's come been presented to the board as,

1439
01:37:59.285 --> 01:38:00.325
Hey, you have an option.

1440
01:38:00.425 --> 01:38:03.405
You have, you can call for special election.

1441
01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.045
You can, uh,

1442
01:38:06.185 --> 01:38:08.485
and this is what we think the approximate cost will be.

1443
01:38:08.895 --> 01:38:10.165
Staff has normally gone

1444
01:38:10.185 --> 01:38:14.045
and talked to, um, uh, the,

1445
01:38:14.185 --> 01:38:15.765
um, register of voters.

1446
01:38:16.205 --> 01:38:17.685
Probably a little difficult phone call right now.

1447
01:38:17.685 --> 01:38:22.525
They're a little busy. But, um, to get that approximate cost

1448
01:38:22.945 --> 01:38:24.605
and presented that in the board meeting,

1449
01:38:25.465 --> 01:38:29.805
or we can do the, um, we can do the appointment

1450
01:38:31.025 --> 01:38:32.405
or we can do nothing.

1451
01:38:32.745 --> 01:38:35.035
And we've done all of those. Um,

1452
01:38:36.135 --> 01:38:40.235
and, uh, um, I, I just, uh,

1453
01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:46.285
I'm, I'm a little, I, I'm, I, I'm a little, um,

1454
01:38:48.065 --> 01:38:51.445
um, I, I think we skipped a step here for one thing,

1455
01:38:51.545 --> 01:38:52.845
but that's, you know,

1456
01:38:52.925 --> 01:38:55.685
I understand why you think we should probably go ahead

1457
01:38:56.555 --> 01:38:59.685
with the appointment because we just had an election.

1458
01:38:59.745 --> 01:39:03.845
No one stepped up. I do know that for whatever reason,

1459
01:39:03.915 --> 01:39:06.365
when you have a special election, people tend to

1460
01:39:07.395 --> 01:39:09.125
sign up more, just like they do

1461
01:39:09.125 --> 01:39:10.245
when you have an appointment.

1462
01:39:10.245 --> 01:39:12.975
People tend to come out more.

1463
01:39:13.995 --> 01:39:15.855
And, and, and it makes no sense

1464
01:39:15.855 --> 01:39:18.855
because you don't have all the questions being grilled at

1465
01:39:18.875 --> 01:39:20.255
you, you do for an appointment.

1466
01:39:20.255 --> 01:39:23.455
It's so much easier to have an to run

1467
01:39:23.475 --> 01:39:25.415
for office than it is to be pointed office.

1468
01:39:25.595 --> 01:39:26.855
So it makes no sense.

1469
01:39:27.075 --> 01:39:29.735
But anyway, um,

1470
01:39:31.855 --> 01:39:33.375
I would personally rather,

1471
01:39:33.915 --> 01:39:38.335
and this is just my view on the thing, I would rather wait

1472
01:39:40.075 --> 01:39:43.415
and make this decision when the vacancy actually occurs.

1473
01:39:43.535 --> 01:39:45.255
I feel we're jumping the gun here.

1474
01:39:45.935 --> 01:39:49.335
I hear what, what, uh, Mr. Funk is saying.

1475
01:39:50.455 --> 01:39:52.855
I, there are a few things that are in the, um,

1476
01:39:53.675 --> 01:39:55.695
in the resolution about, um,

1477
01:39:56.685 --> 01:39:58.745
we don't have a written resignation.

1478
01:39:58.745 --> 01:40:01.105
There's nothing for him to resign from at this point.

1479
01:40:01.445 --> 01:40:03.425
He has never submitted a resignation

1480
01:40:04.925 --> 01:40:06.705
to the Office of Education.

1481
01:40:06.845 --> 01:40:09.625
He submitted one to the Register

1482
01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:10.785
of voters, which means nothing.

1483
01:40:10.885 --> 01:40:13.105
He submitted one to us. That means nothing.

1484
01:40:13.775 --> 01:40:15.985
He's never submitted one to the person that will can,

1485
01:40:16.045 --> 01:40:18.985
he can actually submit it to.

1486
01:40:19.325 --> 01:40:20.465
So, and,

1487
01:40:20.465 --> 01:40:23.145
and not only that, he's not a board member yet, so he can,

1488
01:40:23.475 --> 01:40:24.545
can't resign.

1489
01:40:24.725 --> 01:40:26.865
So this would have to be redone.

1490
01:40:28.085 --> 01:40:32.585
I'm very uncomfortable saying there's a resignation when

1491
01:40:32.585 --> 01:40:34.105
there hasn't been a resignation yet,

1492
01:40:34.105 --> 01:40:37.265
because that he hasn't done the right steps to do that.

1493
01:40:38.285 --> 01:40:42.745
Um, so I'd like to say that let's just wait till the 17th

1494
01:40:42.885 --> 01:40:44.905
and bring this back and start it then.

1495
01:40:44.965 --> 01:40:47.265
And we can still talk about it on the 17th.

1496
01:40:47.405 --> 01:40:51.665
We have the new board member that will be the one actually,

1497
01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:57.005
um, uh, uh, making the decision on this person.

1498
01:40:57.145 --> 01:40:59.605
And perhaps they would want to have the special election.

1499
01:41:00.365 --> 01:41:02.285
I agree, a special election is expensive,

1500
01:41:02.285 --> 01:41:04.245
but we have gone that way twice now.

1501
01:41:05.185 --> 01:41:07.285
Um, and you know, sometimes

1502
01:41:07.285 --> 01:41:08.365
that's just how you have to do it.

1503
01:41:09.345 --> 01:41:11.725
So that, those are my 2 cents

1504
01:41:12.235 --> 01:41:13.235
Trustee spec.

1505
01:41:14.505 --> 01:41:17.005
So I think I'll start with, I think it's really important

1506
01:41:17.005 --> 01:41:20.365
that every area in in Dublin is represented up here.

1507
01:41:20.745 --> 01:41:24.605
And so I think that within our existing board policy

1508
01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:26.645
and within the letter of the law, we need

1509
01:41:26.645 --> 01:41:28.325
to do everything we can to make sure

1510
01:41:28.395 --> 01:41:31.525
that every person in Dublin feels represented.

1511
01:41:31.945 --> 01:41:33.445
And when we move to this Bay Area,

1512
01:41:33.875 --> 01:41:37.245
that means you have someone as quickly as you can, um,

1513
01:41:37.345 --> 01:41:40.405
up here filling a spot for each area within Dublin.

1514
01:41:40.785 --> 01:41:42.605
Um, I have the board policy in front

1515
01:41:42.605 --> 01:41:44.565
of me when a vacancy occurs anytime

1516
01:41:44.995 --> 01:41:48.165
outside the statutory window, um, of number one.

1517
01:41:48.365 --> 01:41:50.725
Number two, the board shall either order an election

1518
01:41:50.865 --> 01:41:52.365
or make a provisional appointment.

1519
01:41:52.825 --> 01:41:54.205
We are not in this,

1520
01:41:54.425 --> 01:41:57.005
no one is suggesting we make the provisional appointment,

1521
01:41:57.505 --> 01:41:59.125
um, until the vacancy occurs.

1522
01:41:59.365 --> 01:42:01.485
I don't see anything in here that says

1523
01:42:02.265 --> 01:42:03.365
you can't start a process.

1524
01:42:03.905 --> 01:42:08.605
You can't ask for, um, applications. I, I just, I don't see.

1525
01:42:08.825 --> 01:42:12.605
So if there is specific text, um, please point it out.

1526
01:42:12.665 --> 01:42:14.605
But I, I, I don't see

1527
01:42:15.145 --> 01:42:16.965
how we're not following the board policy.

1528
01:42:17.285 --> 01:42:19.725
I think it's very important to, for follow board policies.

1529
01:42:20.225 --> 01:42:23.765
Um, I also think if, you know, we've had legal counsel,

1530
01:42:23.915 --> 01:42:26.445
like we should be trusting our legal counsel.

1531
01:42:27.385 --> 01:42:32.125
Um, normally I am a believer in a special election.

1532
01:42:32.585 --> 01:42:35.965
Um, I think we've seen how easy it is

1533
01:42:35.965 --> 01:42:37.765
to get signatures if people are upset.

1534
01:42:38.345 --> 01:42:40.965
Um, uh, you know, with the areas being smaller, it's,

1535
01:42:40.965 --> 01:42:42.125
it's just a small percentage of it.

1536
01:42:42.545 --> 01:42:45.005
Uh, it's a cost,

1537
01:42:45.005 --> 01:42:46.645
but it's important for people to have a say.

1538
01:42:46.955 --> 01:42:50.325
However, um, when this one was open

1539
01:42:50.385 --> 01:42:53.605
and there was publicity about, um, you know,

1540
01:42:53.605 --> 01:42:55.725
that this was open, we needed people to submit.

1541
01:42:56.185 --> 01:42:58.765
Um, this Mr. Clark,

1542
01:42:58.765 --> 01:43:01.405
he put it in like three o'clock on the last day.

1543
01:43:01.435 --> 01:43:04.365
It's not like he submitted weeks before.

1544
01:43:04.385 --> 01:43:05.325
And people were like, well, I

1545
01:43:05.325 --> 01:43:06.245
don't wanna run against someone.

1546
01:43:06.275 --> 01:43:09.365
Like it was open until the very last minute

1547
01:43:09.985 --> 01:43:12.125
and no one put their name in.

1548
01:43:12.225 --> 01:43:16.885
And so it just seems a waste to like, try that again.

1549
01:43:17.305 --> 01:43:20.125
You know what, in December, what? Four months later?

1550
01:43:20.285 --> 01:43:21.965
I mean, I think, you know, we, we,

1551
01:43:22.705 --> 01:43:24.205
we asked, they didn't wanna run.

1552
01:43:24.745 --> 01:43:27.085
Um, and I do think you get more people, we want

1553
01:43:27.085 --> 01:43:28.165
to have this seat filled.

1554
01:43:28.165 --> 01:43:29.845
We want to have this area represented.

1555
01:43:30.305 --> 01:43:35.005
Um, and so I think if we do the provisional, um, appointment

1556
01:43:35.105 --> 01:43:37.965
for the two year period, um, that seems appropriate

1557
01:43:37.965 --> 01:43:41.365
after the, you know, offering this time

1558
01:43:41.365 --> 01:43:44.305
and no one wanted to run, um, I'm

1559
01:43:44.305 --> 01:43:45.545
Gonna make a request for point of order.

1560
01:43:47.085 --> 01:43:49.745
Our agenda right now only covers a provisional appointment.

1561
01:43:49.795 --> 01:43:51.485
We're actually not authorized on the agenda

1562
01:43:51.485 --> 01:43:53.285
to have a discussion about a special election.

1563
01:43:58.345 --> 01:44:00.035
Okay. Well, I didn't bring it up, but, okay.

1564
01:44:00.435 --> 01:44:04.655
I mean, okay.

1565
01:44:04.685 --> 01:44:07.985
Well, um, I'm in favor

1566
01:44:08.165 --> 01:44:10.385
of a provisional appointment.

1567
01:44:10.805 --> 01:44:12.585
I'm in favor of following our board policy

1568
01:44:12.685 --> 01:44:14.105
and not making that provisional appointment

1569
01:44:14.315 --> 01:44:16.145
until December 17th.

1570
01:44:16.285 --> 01:44:18.305
But I'm mostly in favor of making sure

1571
01:44:18.305 --> 01:44:19.505
that Area three is represented,

1572
01:44:19.575 --> 01:44:21.305
because I think that's the right thing to do

1573
01:44:21.405 --> 01:44:22.745
by the citizens of Dublin.

1574
01:44:23.005 --> 01:44:24.265
And so, um,

1575
01:44:25.005 --> 01:44:29.005
that's my feeling. Jesse Chair.

1576
01:44:29.535 --> 01:44:30.845
Thank you. Sorry,

1577
01:44:30.845 --> 01:44:32.645
we're having such a long conversation about this,

1578
01:44:32.785 --> 01:44:36.605
but, um, I'm a little wordy too.

1579
01:44:36.945 --> 01:44:41.375
If, if the

1580
01:44:42.315 --> 01:44:43.975
county certifies the election

1581
01:44:45.025 --> 01:44:49.745
and then we certify the election, technically,

1582
01:44:49.815 --> 01:44:53.065
even though he is not seated, Mr. Clark is the trustee

1583
01:44:53.915 --> 01:44:57.065
until he files a valid resignation letter.

1584
01:44:58.165 --> 01:45:01.345
Uh, that's the way I understand it. It looks like Mr.

1585
01:45:01.475 --> 01:45:02.345
Funks not agreeing with that.

1586
01:45:02.365 --> 01:45:03.585
So we'll let him speak in a minute.

1587
01:45:04.205 --> 01:45:08.265
But, um, uh, until we get

1588
01:45:08.265 --> 01:45:13.245
that resignation letter, uh, I, I think we're

1589
01:45:13.875 --> 01:45:17.445
work in a, in a, in a quasi land here of

1590
01:45:18.465 --> 01:45:21.725
he would have to not do the duties for three months

1591
01:45:22.915 --> 01:45:26.655
before we could say that it's a vacated seat.

1592
01:45:27.275 --> 01:45:28.815
So, uh, I'm gonna let Mr.

1593
01:45:28.885 --> 01:45:31.855
Funk, he's anxious to, to say I'm wronger.

1594
01:45:33.835 --> 01:45:35.645
Well, no, I'm not anxious to say you're wrong.

1595
01:45:35.765 --> 01:45:37.525
I, I just wanna clarify a couple of things.

1596
01:45:37.945 --> 01:45:40.645
Uh, first and foremost, uh, I

1597
01:45:40.665 --> 01:45:43.325
or staff did not unilaterally make the decision

1598
01:45:43.425 --> 01:45:47.245
to bring this resolution forward, um, in consultation

1599
01:45:47.515 --> 01:45:49.165
with the president and the vice president.

1600
01:45:49.385 --> 01:45:51.965
And then after meeting with for the trustees,

1601
01:45:52.585 --> 01:45:53.845
the consensus was

1602
01:45:53.985 --> 01:45:56.045
to bring forward a provisional appointment.

1603
01:45:56.925 --> 01:46:00.125
I did, uh, follow legal counsel down

1604
01:46:00.185 --> 01:46:02.405
to the every step, step of the way.

1605
01:46:02.875 --> 01:46:05.365
This resolution is the same resolution

1606
01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:07.845
as the last two provisional appointments.

1607
01:46:07.865 --> 01:46:10.005
So we didn't change the language of the resolution.

1608
01:46:11.145 --> 01:46:15.205
The attachment of the application is the same application

1609
01:46:15.205 --> 01:46:16.885
this board has used the last two times.

1610
01:46:17.385 --> 01:46:20.885
So staff is not creating something, uh, out of nothing.

1611
01:46:21.745 --> 01:46:24.285
Um, and a, a reminder

1612
01:46:24.635 --> 01:46:28.685
that even if the board does a provisional appointment, the,

1613
01:46:28.705 --> 01:46:33.405
the area, three constituents have 30 days to file a petition

1614
01:46:33.585 --> 01:46:36.165
to not accept that into California election.

1615
01:46:37.095 --> 01:46:40.835
So there is still potential, uh, election 30 days out,

1616
01:46:40.975 --> 01:46:44.395
but all of that then will be outside of the window

1617
01:46:44.575 --> 01:46:47.275
for the board to actually make decisions around the budget.

1618
01:46:47.935 --> 01:46:50.885
And so the whole was to try to make sure

1619
01:46:50.915 --> 01:46:54.365
that Area three is fully represented

1620
01:46:54.905 --> 01:46:55.965
as soon as possible.

1621
01:46:56.505 --> 01:47:01.165
The constituents, if a trustee does not get seated on

1622
01:47:01.365 --> 01:47:03.685
December 17th, they have vacated their spot.

1623
01:47:03.685 --> 01:47:05.485
They do not have to submit a resignation

1624
01:47:06.265 --> 01:47:09.165
if they're not seated on December 17th,

1625
01:47:09.195 --> 01:47:11.205
they are no longer a a trustee.

1626
01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:16.645
Um, the our legal counsel suggested, just to make it clear

1627
01:47:16.795 --> 01:47:18.685
that they're not gonna be here to be seated,

1628
01:47:18.795 --> 01:47:22.285
that they could submit a resignation, uh, to the district.

1629
01:47:22.425 --> 01:47:25.885
So, um, we can get more clarity from legal counsel,

1630
01:47:26.385 --> 01:47:28.685
but I have followed every step from legal counsel,

1631
01:47:28.865 --> 01:47:31.245
and I consulted with the majority

1632
01:47:31.245 --> 01:47:32.605
of the board on this direction,

1633
01:47:34.365 --> 01:47:35.375
Trustee Blackman.

1634
01:47:35.925 --> 01:47:36.975
Okay, so I wanna preface,

1635
01:47:37.055 --> 01:47:38.535
I hope you didn't talk to the majority of the board.

1636
01:47:39.235 --> 01:47:40.895
Um, but the one thing that I'm,

1637
01:47:41.765 --> 01:47:45.505
but to, to say that the item was on the agenda, yes,

1638
01:47:46.405 --> 01:47:47.905
but you told me the item was on the agenda,

1639
01:47:47.965 --> 01:47:49.305
but I'm also a little concerned

1640
01:47:49.305 --> 01:47:50.825
that we have an outgoing board member.

1641
01:47:50.975 --> 01:47:52.785
Typically, when the seat is vacant,

1642
01:47:53.005 --> 01:47:55.865
the outgoing board member, so for example, Joe Jean anyway,

1643
01:47:55.865 --> 01:47:57.505
stepped down, had no ability

1644
01:47:57.645 --> 01:48:00.225
to actually make any recommendation for how the process

1645
01:48:00.365 --> 01:48:01.745
to replace his seat would've occurred.

1646
01:48:02.325 --> 01:48:05.425
My concern right now is we've actually involved, um,

1647
01:48:05.695 --> 01:48:08.665
trustee quo in a decision to put forward on the agenda,

1648
01:48:08.805 --> 01:48:10.065
the option only to appoint.

1649
01:48:10.525 --> 01:48:13.705
And that would seem outside the norm if the position was

1650
01:48:13.705 --> 01:48:15.985
truly vacated, he wouldn't be part of the conversation

1651
01:48:15.985 --> 01:48:17.025
to put this on the agenda.

1652
01:48:17.125 --> 01:48:18.265
So he is already, in fact,

1653
01:48:18.265 --> 01:48:21.105
impressed upon the board his point of view,

1654
01:48:21.635 --> 01:48:23.585
which he should not have a vote on

1655
01:48:23.765 --> 01:48:26.705
how we proceed moving forward to replace Mr. Clark.

1656
01:48:27.955 --> 01:48:29.415
So I'm already concerned right now,

1657
01:48:29.505 --> 01:48:33.495
we've basically moved into some really dicey territory with

1658
01:48:33.495 --> 01:48:35.695
how we've handled this, I believe, to make certain

1659
01:48:35.695 --> 01:48:39.335
that this is clean and clear, that we actually wait until

1660
01:48:39.995 --> 01:48:42.215
the 17th so that we don't have

1661
01:48:42.215 --> 01:48:44.255
to worry about cleaning up whatever mess we

1662
01:48:44.255 --> 01:48:45.335
may have created at this point,

1663
01:48:48.395 --> 01:48:49.395
Trustee equal.

1664
01:48:53.305 --> 01:48:58.195
Um, I will say that getting appointed is

1665
01:48:58.355 --> 01:48:59.435
actually easier than running an election.

1666
01:48:59.535 --> 01:49:02.195
So I'll, I'll make that clear.

1667
01:49:02.775 --> 01:49:06.275
Um, so I'm hoping by that comment

1668
01:49:06.345 --> 01:49:08.755
that we would get more folks to

1669
01:49:09.495 --> 01:49:11.195
put their names in for appointment.

1670
01:49:11.535 --> 01:49:13.595
And yes, I agree with the fact that I shouldn't be deciding

1671
01:49:13.665 --> 01:49:15.555
what should be happening in on December.

1672
01:49:16.295 --> 01:49:20.955
Um, but I am appreciative, appreciative of the fact

1673
01:49:20.955 --> 01:49:23.475
that we're making this announcement so the community knows,

1674
01:49:23.815 --> 01:49:25.835
um, instead of waiting till two seven 17th

1675
01:49:25.895 --> 01:49:27.195
and get this thing rolling.

1676
01:49:28.015 --> 01:49:32.135
Um, but yeah,

1677
01:49:32.595 --> 01:49:33.735
so, so those are my comments.

1678
01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:35.455
I'm not sure if I should vote on this.

1679
01:49:35.755 --> 01:49:39.185
If you guys do decide to vote on this thing tonight that,

1680
01:49:39.185 --> 01:49:42.785
that's, need a little bit further thought on that one.

1681
01:49:44.385 --> 01:49:46.525
Um, can I make one comment then? I'll just here.

1682
01:49:46.995 --> 01:49:50.055
Um, and I know I'm, I'm rolling off, I know that, um,

1683
01:49:51.355 --> 01:49:54.615
but I, I believe it is in the best interest of the district

1684
01:49:54.805 --> 01:49:58.655
because of the speed at which

1685
01:49:59.975 --> 01:50:02.415
decisions need to be made about the budget in order for

1686
01:50:03.255 --> 01:50:05.855
reduction in force notices and all of that, that need

1687
01:50:06.095 --> 01:50:08.095
to be done in a very timely manner,

1688
01:50:08.405 --> 01:50:11.775
that if things are not done quickly, we will not have

1689
01:50:12.795 --> 01:50:13.885
area three represented.

1690
01:50:14.105 --> 01:50:16.085
We won't have a full board, um,

1691
01:50:16.105 --> 01:50:17.405
or you won't have a full board.

1692
01:50:18.065 --> 01:50:20.925
And, um, the likelihood of a two, two vote

1693
01:50:21.465 --> 01:50:23.645
and nothing passing and having no budget

1694
01:50:23.665 --> 01:50:25.965
and not being able to make the necessary budget cuts

1695
01:50:27.005 --> 01:50:30.475
is a realistic concern in my mind.

1696
01:50:31.215 --> 01:50:33.955
Um, whether it's waiting until December

1697
01:50:34.135 --> 01:50:37.435
to then start the appointment process, I think it needs

1698
01:50:37.435 --> 01:50:38.795
to be done quickly.

1699
01:50:39.335 --> 01:50:44.285
Um, I think whether it, you know, we, you guys discuss at

1700
01:50:44.285 --> 01:50:48.765
that meeting, um, you know, whether it's an appointment

1701
01:50:48.785 --> 01:50:52.765
or a a, um, election, um, I just think that the time

1702
01:50:52.825 --> 01:50:56.685
and cost that would take a special election in terms of

1703
01:50:56.685 --> 01:50:59.655
what decisions need to be done, um,

1704
01:51:00.355 --> 01:51:02.735
and be made at the district level, which are very,

1705
01:51:02.735 --> 01:51:03.935
very important decisions.

1706
01:51:04.295 --> 01:51:07.725
I think waiting and doing that is, is a disservice.

1707
01:51:08.545 --> 01:51:10.645
Um, and I'm, I've tried

1708
01:51:10.645 --> 01:51:13.085
to leave the place better than I got it when I

1709
01:51:13.085 --> 01:51:14.165
came here four years ago.

1710
01:51:14.345 --> 01:51:17.245
Um, and I kind of don't wanna leave a mess

1711
01:51:17.245 --> 01:51:18.365
for the next, the next group.

1712
01:51:19.065 --> 01:51:20.845
Um, and so that was my,

1713
01:51:22.225 --> 01:51:24.095
my kind of motivation.

1714
01:51:24.275 --> 01:51:28.335
Um, I know, um, I had asked that we, we run it by legal

1715
01:51:28.435 --> 01:51:29.975
and say, you know, what does this mean?

1716
01:51:30.035 --> 01:51:31.815
We have this, this resignation.

1717
01:51:31.845 --> 01:51:33.375
They, he said, he is not coming.

1718
01:51:33.805 --> 01:51:35.495
He's not going to, to fill this seat.

1719
01:51:35.635 --> 01:51:38.615
So I, I think it's very clear, um,

1720
01:51:39.115 --> 01:51:41.295
and maybe we get another letter that's different,

1721
01:51:41.315 --> 01:51:44.535
but I, I think if, if it was run by legal

1722
01:51:44.535 --> 01:51:46.775
that this letter was acceptable, um,

1723
01:51:46.875 --> 01:51:47.975
I'm not sure why we need that.

1724
01:51:48.235 --> 01:51:50.695
But, um, that's just my 2 cents, trustee chair.

1725
01:51:51.465 --> 01:51:52.495
Thank you. Um,

1726
01:51:53.715 --> 01:51:58.445
and the, um, trying to come to some sort of compromise here.

1727
01:51:59.745 --> 01:52:02.975
Um, I, um,

1728
01:52:05.775 --> 01:52:09.695
I I, I would be open to maybe having a,

1729
01:52:11.095 --> 01:52:14.535
starting the advertisement process, uh,

1730
01:52:14.535 --> 01:52:17.615
because, you know, you could word out something like there

1731
01:52:17.835 --> 01:52:21.195
may be a vacancy, something along those lines.

1732
01:52:21.255 --> 01:52:23.195
Please get your application in.

1733
01:52:24.055 --> 01:52:27.035
Uh, I, I truly don't think legally,

1734
01:52:27.335 --> 01:52:30.035
we have a vacancy right now, so it's hard to advertise

1735
01:52:30.035 --> 01:52:31.195
to say we have a vacancy.

1736
01:52:31.895 --> 01:52:33.635
But if there's a way around that, fine.

1737
01:52:34.775 --> 01:52:36.515
And, uh, I, I don't,

1738
01:52:36.915 --> 01:52:39.275
I think we need a little more time than trying

1739
01:52:39.275 --> 01:52:42.075
to do it on the 17th with, you know, that's normally a

1740
01:52:43.385 --> 01:52:45.365
resetting the board and everything else.

1741
01:52:46.825 --> 01:52:51.185
Uh, maybe a, uh, maybe that,

1742
01:52:51.215 --> 01:52:56.145
that first meeting we have in in January is the,

1743
01:52:56.165 --> 01:52:57.345
is the time to do that

1744
01:52:57.805 --> 01:53:01.345
and, uh, you know, have that meeting where we,

1745
01:53:01.805 --> 01:53:04.625
we interview the people and, and do it.

1746
01:53:04.655 --> 01:53:06.425
That gets the process going.

1747
01:53:07.325 --> 01:53:09.705
Uh, in the meantime, um,

1748
01:53:11.475 --> 01:53:15.725
perhaps we can ask Mr. Clark to actually submit

1749
01:53:16.985 --> 01:53:20.925
an effective December 18th letter to

1750
01:53:22.345 --> 01:53:24.845
the superintendent of education for Alameda County.

1751
01:53:24.945 --> 01:53:27.005
So there's no doubt that we're following the law.

1752
01:53:28.185 --> 01:53:29.645
He, he may or may not do that.

1753
01:53:30.705 --> 01:53:34.645
Uh, and if he doesn't want to do that, if I,

1754
01:53:34.805 --> 01:53:37.085
I can't find in here where it says, and,

1755
01:53:37.265 --> 01:53:39.765
and, you know, it's hard to read what you're trying to talk,

1756
01:53:40.625 --> 01:53:42.925
but, um, where it says,

1757
01:53:42.925 --> 01:53:44.725
if we don't seat him, he's not a trustee.

1758
01:53:44.945 --> 01:53:47.765
He is been actually elected to the office.

1759
01:53:48.225 --> 01:53:52.285
Um, I, I, I just want to double check

1760
01:53:53.145 --> 01:53:56.605
by whatever, wherever in the code, it's saying that, that,

1761
01:53:56.745 --> 01:53:59.405
uh, if you could get that me that information, uh,

1762
01:53:59.785 --> 01:54:02.085
superintendent funk, that'd be really appreciated.

1763
01:54:03.025 --> 01:54:06.685
Um, so I'd be,

1764
01:54:08.345 --> 01:54:11.125
do we need a resolution to just advertise?

1765
01:54:13.875 --> 01:54:16.815
Yes, the resolution is around the visual appointment

1766
01:54:16.835 --> 01:54:19.575
and that defines the, the process.

1767
01:54:19.835 --> 01:54:20.935
So I, I would be much,

1768
01:54:20.995 --> 01:54:23.495
if the board's not comfortable passing this resolution,

1769
01:54:23.565 --> 01:54:24.855
then I would rather wait

1770
01:54:25.355 --> 01:54:27.615
and not advertise without the resolution.

1771
01:54:28.515 --> 01:54:30.775
The, uh, county superintendent is aware

1772
01:54:30.795 --> 01:54:32.375
of the pending vacancy.

1773
01:54:32.755 --> 01:54:35.935
Uh, I will speak with her tomorrow to find out whether

1774
01:54:35.955 --> 01:54:39.335
or not the letter that I have will, um,

1775
01:54:39.715 --> 01:54:41.175
be suffice enough for her.

1776
01:54:41.555 --> 01:54:42.975
We were gonna send the resolution

1777
01:54:43.235 --> 01:54:45.535
and the current letter to, uh,

1778
01:54:45.555 --> 01:54:47.335
her tomorrow if the board had passed it.

1779
01:54:47.635 --> 01:54:49.575
But I will follow up with her on exactly the

1780
01:54:49.775 --> 01:54:50.855
documentation she would need.

1781
01:54:51.475 --> 01:54:52.935
My concern is, is that

1782
01:54:53.005 --> 01:54:57.855
that letter says effective immediately, he's not a trustee

1783
01:54:58.035 --> 01:54:59.535
yet, so he can't resign yet.

1784
01:55:00.115 --> 01:55:03.175
So it, it, there's nothing to resign from right now.

1785
01:55:03.555 --> 01:55:05.735
So the effective immediately doesn't make any sense

1786
01:55:06.605 --> 01:55:09.775
that from a, from a legality point of view,

1787
01:55:09.775 --> 01:55:10.935
you know, I do contracts all the time.

1788
01:55:10.935 --> 01:55:11.975
This doesn't make any sense.

1789
01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:15.255
What we're trying to do, we, it needs to be dated

1790
01:55:15.425 --> 01:55:19.895
after he becomes the trustee, uh, for it

1791
01:55:19.895 --> 01:55:21.135
to be a valid letter.

1792
01:55:21.475 --> 01:55:23.535
And it, um, so

1793
01:55:25.905 --> 01:55:27.175
those are my takes on it.

1794
01:55:27.175 --> 01:55:29.655
And if we want to start the advertisement process,

1795
01:55:29.835 --> 01:55:32.375
we have plenty of time to get good candidates.

1796
01:55:33.495 --> 01:55:34.735
I have no problem with that.

1797
01:55:35.075 --> 01:55:36.375
Uh, I know, uh,

1798
01:55:36.565 --> 01:55:39.655
trustee Blackman said we can't talk about any other way

1799
01:55:39.655 --> 01:55:43.135
of doing this, and I agree we should at least start

1800
01:55:43.435 --> 01:55:46.765
with the, um, the, um,

1801
01:55:48.585 --> 01:55:51.885
uh, appointment process, um,

1802
01:55:53.445 --> 01:55:55.905
you know, and, uh, uh,

1803
01:55:56.285 --> 01:55:59.425
but, you know, we have skipped a step in our normal process,

1804
01:56:00.525 --> 01:56:03.305
but, uh, that's, this is the agenda item we have

1805
01:56:03.305 --> 01:56:04.425
before us tonight, so,

1806
01:56:04.645 --> 01:56:07.145
So may I ask a clarification just on your point there?

1807
01:56:07.295 --> 01:56:08.505
Yeah. Are you suggesting

1808
01:56:08.505 --> 01:56:12.985
that we have an agenda item on December 3rd, whether

1809
01:56:12.985 --> 01:56:14.705
or not to do a

1810
01:56:15.335 --> 01:56:17.305
provisional appointment or to hold an election?

1811
01:56:18.165 --> 01:56:22.105
And if it's to do a provisional appointment that we bring

1812
01:56:22.105 --> 01:56:24.465
that resolution back on December 17th?

1813
01:56:27.895 --> 01:56:29.995
Um, we, we, we could do that.

1814
01:56:30.375 --> 01:56:35.275
Um, uh, if, if that sat, I, I,

1815
01:56:35.375 --> 01:56:37.875
you know, I'm, I'm already saying I'm, I probably okay

1816
01:56:37.905 --> 01:56:39.595
with the, the, the appointment.

1817
01:56:39.935 --> 01:56:43.875
Um, but it just, you know, we've never done this before.

1818
01:56:43.885 --> 01:56:47.715
We've always had, you know, step one

1819
01:56:47.715 --> 01:56:48.915
and then step two Sure.

1820
01:56:49.335 --> 01:56:52.505
Um, every other time we've done this.

1821
01:56:53.085 --> 01:56:55.425
Um, but, um,

1822
01:56:57.915 --> 01:57:02.815
uh, I don't know, to put it on the third, we'd have

1823
01:57:02.835 --> 01:57:06.095
to, we already approved one agenda item, so we'd have

1824
01:57:06.095 --> 01:57:07.495
to su suspend the rules

1825
01:57:07.635 --> 01:57:09.135
and that would take all of us to do that.

1826
01:57:09.435 --> 01:57:13.175
So, um, anyway, I,

1827
01:57:13.235 --> 01:57:14.455
I'm just throwing some ideas out there.

1828
01:57:14.495 --> 01:57:15.495
I don't know the answer.

1829
01:57:16.445 --> 01:57:18.215
Trustee Blackman and then Trustee Speck.

1830
01:57:18.475 --> 01:57:19.495
Hi. Sorry. I was wondering,

1831
01:57:19.495 --> 01:57:22.455
since we're having this discussion here, obviously, uh,

1832
01:57:22.455 --> 01:57:24.455
superintendent Funk and staff, you're going

1833
01:57:24.455 --> 01:57:27.455
to make some sort of a press release information shared

1834
01:57:27.455 --> 01:57:29.335
with the public about what happened at the board meeting,

1835
01:57:29.335 --> 01:57:30.855
which is a great opportunity for Chip

1836
01:57:30.855 --> 01:57:33.175
to do his wonderful writing skills

1837
01:57:33.355 --> 01:57:36.295
and basically somehow codified that there is a position

1838
01:57:36.295 --> 01:57:40.135
that will be opening up in area three, the current status of

1839
01:57:40.135 --> 01:57:43.015
that position that we'll be seeking candidates.

1840
01:57:43.675 --> 01:57:45.375
The process isn't yet well defined,

1841
01:57:45.475 --> 01:57:46.735
but these are the things to consider.

1842
01:57:46.835 --> 01:57:49.015
Here's an example of what the questionnaire might be.

1843
01:57:49.035 --> 01:57:50.295
So you get people thinking about,

1844
01:57:50.315 --> 01:57:51.935
and they can get geared up, which allows us

1845
01:57:51.935 --> 01:57:53.575
to go a lot faster without actually having

1846
01:57:53.595 --> 01:57:55.295
to have made the decision one way or another.

1847
01:57:56.115 --> 01:57:58.415
So I'm just saying, without us actually approving one thing

1848
01:57:58.415 --> 01:58:00.615
or another right now, you have the ability

1849
01:58:00.615 --> 01:58:03.175
to actually initiate engaging the community in

1850
01:58:03.325 --> 01:58:05.375
what would be an interest reaching out to

1851
01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:07.495
Them, not after this discussion tonight.

1852
01:58:07.635 --> 01:58:09.815
I'm not gonna authorize him to write anything about it,

1853
01:58:09.815 --> 01:58:11.135
because if the board does not

1854
01:58:12.085 --> 01:58:14.735
even take the action on this one way

1855
01:58:14.735 --> 01:58:17.895
or another, it just moves on to the next agenda item.

1856
01:58:18.155 --> 01:58:20.535
So we don't cover that in the, in the update.

1857
01:58:21.035 --> 01:58:24.895
Uh, and I'm certainly not gonna put out the qualifications

1858
01:58:24.915 --> 01:58:27.215
or the sample application without board's approval.

1859
01:58:27.675 --> 01:58:28.695
So unless I get,

1860
01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:30.415
unless there's action by this board,

1861
01:58:30.475 --> 01:58:33.735
I'm not gonna touch anything on this until, uh,

1862
01:58:33.855 --> 01:58:34.855
a resolution is passed.

1863
01:58:35.395 --> 01:58:36.575
Uh, just to clarify, the

1864
01:58:36.575 --> 01:58:38.135
applications attached to the agenda item?

1865
01:58:38.515 --> 01:58:40.055
Yes. So the public has access to it,

1866
01:58:40.445 --> 01:58:42.645
They have access to it because it's an agenda item.

1867
01:58:42.665 --> 01:58:45.925
But if the board takes no action, I, I'm not gonna follow up

1868
01:58:45.925 --> 01:58:47.885
with any, uh, further communication.

1869
01:58:48.435 --> 01:58:49.435
Okay.

1870
01:58:50.535 --> 01:58:53.305
Okay. So first off, it, it's all over the local news.

1871
01:58:53.405 --> 01:58:54.945
So it's already been in the Pleasanton Weekly,

1872
01:58:54.975 --> 01:58:55.985
it's been in the independent,

1873
01:58:55.985 --> 01:58:57.345
it's been in the Livermore Vine.

1874
01:58:57.725 --> 01:59:01.585
Um, so it, it's widely publicized that, um,

1875
01:59:02.205 --> 01:59:04.505
Mr. Clark is not coming into this role.

1876
01:59:05.205 --> 01:59:08.345
Um, you had said, you know, we could put out,

1877
01:59:08.345 --> 01:59:09.425
there might be a vacancy,

1878
01:59:09.425 --> 01:59:12.345
that there will be a vacancy on December 17th.

1879
01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:15.385
Now, I, I understand you want him to,

1880
01:59:15.405 --> 01:59:17.945
to submit a letter different than what our lawyer said,

1881
01:59:17.945 --> 01:59:19.345
which he can do.

1882
01:59:20.045 --> 01:59:23.265
But this gentleman has said he is not coming.

1883
01:59:24.005 --> 01:59:27.505
So, um, we can do different paperwork,

1884
01:59:27.765 --> 01:59:31.065
but we will have a vacancy on December 17th.

1885
01:59:31.485 --> 01:59:35.305
So, um, I just, I think it's important that we, we live in

1886
01:59:35.305 --> 01:59:38.905
that reality, um, and, and plan towards it.

1887
01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:41.425
You talked about on December 17th is typically our

1888
01:59:41.425 --> 01:59:42.425
organizational meeting.

1889
01:59:43.305 --> 01:59:45.465
I, I wouldn't, I mean, as one of the people coming back,

1890
01:59:46.085 --> 01:59:49.025
why would we four of us pick all the things

1891
01:59:49.025 --> 01:59:50.345
that we're gonna be involved in

1892
01:59:50.345 --> 01:59:52.865
and then redo it one meeting later?

1893
01:59:52.895 --> 01:59:54.665
Like, we would just wait.

1894
01:59:54.935 --> 01:59:56.905
It's different when you might have a

1895
01:59:57.065 --> 01:59:58.225
position open for six months.

1896
01:59:58.225 --> 01:59:59.705
Of course you would, you know, make sure you,

1897
01:59:59.705 --> 02:00:01.985
we have on the committee, but if, if we're just gonna meet

1898
02:00:02.575 --> 02:00:05.145
like a few weeks later, you wouldn't even bother with that.

1899
02:00:05.385 --> 02:00:07.025
'cause then you're gonna, you're gonna wanna make sure

1900
02:00:07.025 --> 02:00:08.225
that person gets their say.

1901
02:00:08.285 --> 02:00:12.455
And so, um, I just think it's, again,

1902
02:00:12.675 --> 02:00:16.455
if we have the time, which we do from right now,

1903
02:00:16.595 --> 02:00:18.135
to get everything in place

1904
02:00:18.155 --> 02:00:21.455
and do all the right steps, that we could try to appoint

1905
02:00:21.455 --> 02:00:22.495
that person on the 17th

1906
02:00:22.555 --> 02:00:24.015
so we can have an organizational meeting

1907
02:00:24.045 --> 02:00:25.295
with five individuals

1908
02:00:25.955 --> 02:00:28.135
and, you know, make sure that they each get

1909
02:00:28.805 --> 02:00:30.135
what they, what they're passionate about.

1910
02:00:30.235 --> 02:00:31.855
And every, you know, everything gets represented.

1911
02:00:32.085 --> 02:00:34.135
Otherwise, I think it's a short meeting

1912
02:00:34.495 --> 02:00:37.255
'cause you're waiting the couple weeks if we do decide

1913
02:00:37.255 --> 02:00:41.055
to wait till January, um, and, and doing it then.

1914
02:00:42.275 --> 02:00:45.335
So Trustee Cole.

1915
02:00:47.135 --> 02:00:48.945
Yeah. Um, I, I gave you some more thought.

1916
02:00:48.965 --> 02:00:53.665
And I think if we do end up voting on this today,

1917
02:00:53.785 --> 02:00:56.185
I will be, I will be approving it only

1918
02:00:56.185 --> 02:01:00.275
because as, uh, superintendent Funk mentioned

1919
02:01:00.275 --> 02:01:02.115
that the community does have 30 days

1920
02:01:02.135 --> 02:01:03.315
to rescind the appointment.

1921
02:01:03.935 --> 02:01:05.075
And in interest of time

1922
02:01:05.295 --> 02:01:08.835
and the functioning of the board going forward

1923
02:01:08.835 --> 02:01:13.315
with the budget on the agenda, um, you know, we'll see

1924
02:01:13.315 --> 02:01:15.595
how it goes, how, how it plays out if

1925
02:01:16.175 --> 02:01:17.715
the appointment comes forward.

1926
02:01:17.935 --> 02:01:20.075
And appointee is not someone that every three likes,

1927
02:01:20.075 --> 02:01:21.195
they have 30 days to change it.

1928
02:01:21.435 --> 02:01:24.395
I don't see how the timeline changes if we were

1929
02:01:24.395 --> 02:01:26.475
to go do an election and drag it everything out.

1930
02:01:26.615 --> 02:01:31.395
So, um, I'd be looking, I will support this

1931
02:01:31.395 --> 02:01:32.395
as is for today.

1932
02:01:33.885 --> 02:01:34.935
Trustee Blackman.

1933
02:01:35.355 --> 02:01:37.695
Hi. So I just remind every member of the board

1934
02:01:37.695 --> 02:01:41.765
that when you swore an oath of office, you swore an oath

1935
02:01:41.765 --> 02:01:44.285
to hold the state constitution all of our codes

1936
02:01:44.285 --> 02:01:46.205
and laws, as well as the federal Constitution

1937
02:01:46.205 --> 02:01:47.205
and all of our federal laws.

1938
02:01:47.735 --> 02:01:50.445
Which means that if you knowingly are actually moving ahead

1939
02:01:50.445 --> 02:01:52.885
with an act now to vote on something that, you know, skirts,

1940
02:01:52.995 --> 02:01:55.285
code and law, you have violated your oath.

1941
02:01:55.945 --> 02:01:59.245
It is why I'm vehemently against taking this action today.

1942
02:01:59.595 --> 02:02:02.165
Because we know that we are required to do certain things

1943
02:02:02.185 --> 02:02:04.485
and certain steps and certain process to ensure

1944
02:02:04.595 --> 02:02:06.845
that this individual has been properly seated,

1945
02:02:06.955 --> 02:02:09.485
he's properly resigned, we've properly taken action.

1946
02:02:09.945 --> 02:02:10.925
We have codes, we have

1947
02:02:10.945 --> 02:02:12.285
bylaws and things that we're supposed to follow.

1948
02:02:12.435 --> 02:02:15.125
Just because we feel that we have information that precludes

1949
02:02:15.665 --> 02:02:17.725
making those decisions in a timely,

1950
02:02:18.105 --> 02:02:21.085
lawful manner doesn't mean that we are actually imbued

1951
02:02:21.085 --> 02:02:22.405
with the ability to skirt those.

1952
02:02:23.145 --> 02:02:26.365
So I would caution anyone who decides that they feel

1953
02:02:26.365 --> 02:02:27.725
that they're comfortable with doing this,

1954
02:02:27.795 --> 02:02:30.085
that you actually bring upon you, um,

1955
02:02:30.085 --> 02:02:33.525
certain probably legal ramifications should anybody in

1956
02:02:33.525 --> 02:02:35.965
that community decide that we did not take lawful

1957
02:02:35.965 --> 02:02:37.045
steps that're required to do.

1958
02:02:40.865 --> 02:02:44.785
I would say personally, I would follow the advice

1959
02:02:44.785 --> 02:02:46.385
of legal counsel that said

1960
02:02:46.385 --> 02:02:49.185
that this is a resignation letter and we could move forward.

1961
02:02:49.885 --> 02:02:51.785
Um, and I would feel that I am following,

1962
02:02:53.615 --> 02:02:56.705
following the rules, um, in that, in that aspect.

1963
02:02:57.445 --> 02:03:01.035
Um, so I think there's two options. We can approve.

1964
02:03:01.095 --> 02:03:02.555
We can do nothing tonight.

1965
02:03:03.955 --> 02:03:07.055
We can potentially do something on the third

1966
02:03:07.555 --> 02:03:09.135
or what, whatever date that is.

1967
02:03:10.365 --> 02:03:11.665
We have a, a mini meeting.

1968
02:03:12.775 --> 02:03:15.235
Um, at some point potentially do something on

1969
02:03:15.235 --> 02:03:16.275
that if everyone is in agreement

1970
02:03:17.015 --> 02:03:19.555
or it waits until the December 17th meeting,

1971
02:03:19.615 --> 02:03:24.255
and then you don't have someone in place for that meeting

1972
02:03:24.475 --> 02:03:27.775
to do kind of the full reorganization.

1973
02:03:28.435 --> 02:03:31.855
Um, so at this point, um, I will take, if there's anyone

1974
02:03:31.855 --> 02:03:34.535
that has a motion at this point, um,

1975
02:03:35.195 --> 02:03:37.575
to move forward on something just so we can

1976
02:03:38.125 --> 02:03:39.135
vote or not vote.

1977
02:03:40.035 --> 02:03:42.015
Um, I think we need to, to kind

1978
02:03:42.015 --> 02:03:43.135
of get on the record on this.

1979
02:03:43.395 --> 02:03:48.135
Um, I believe that the consultation with legal

1980
02:03:49.205 --> 02:03:51.175
felt that this resignation letter was sufficient.

1981
02:03:51.715 --> 02:03:53.255
Um, and I'm okay with that.

1982
02:03:54.395 --> 02:03:58.935
Um, I, I think it's important that trust that Area three is

1983
02:03:59.815 --> 02:04:00.895
represented as soon as possible.

1984
02:04:02.475 --> 02:04:06.575
And just to clarify, legal said that, um, the letter

1985
02:04:07.175 --> 02:04:12.055
sufficient to pass a resolution to actually post the,

1986
02:04:12.555 --> 02:04:15.055
uh, vacancy, not to take action.

1987
02:04:15.435 --> 02:04:18.255
The board cannot take action until

1988
02:04:18.385 --> 02:04:23.375
after, uh, the election is certified.

1989
02:04:23.475 --> 02:04:25.335
And it's the second Friday of December.

1990
02:04:26.295 --> 02:04:28.435
We happen to have our board meeting on the 17th,

1991
02:04:29.015 --> 02:04:30.675
but it's actually the 14th

1992
02:04:31.215 --> 02:04:34.795
is when they actually assume the position, um,

1993
02:04:35.445 --> 02:04:36.475
based on the election.

1994
02:04:37.025 --> 02:04:39.965
Um, but we seat new trustees at our

1995
02:04:39.965 --> 02:04:41.165
board meeting on the 17th.

1996
02:04:41.905 --> 02:04:45.525
So taking action on the 17th would be appropriate

1997
02:04:45.705 --> 02:04:46.885
to fill the vacancy.

1998
02:04:47.365 --> 02:04:49.445
'cause the vacancy actually would occur on the 14th.

1999
02:04:51.465 --> 02:04:55.945
To clarify this resolution is to say

2000
02:04:56.135 --> 02:04:58.145
that there is going to be a vacancy

2001
02:04:58.765 --> 02:05:02.665
and this is the procedure that will be followed on

2002
02:05:04.725 --> 02:05:05.385
the 17th,

2003
02:05:07.695 --> 02:05:10.285
or I guess we have to decide

2004
02:05:10.285 --> 02:05:11.405
that. I think that would be part of the

2005
02:05:11.405 --> 02:05:12.405
Vote. Yeah, I mean, I, I'm

2006
02:05:12.405 --> 02:05:13.045
happy to make the motion.

2007
02:05:13.125 --> 02:05:17.205
I do have a couple questions specific into the resolution

2008
02:05:17.205 --> 02:05:18.245
and some of the questions,

2009
02:05:18.345 --> 02:05:22.885
but, um, I heard what President Pel said as far as if we,

2010
02:05:23.375 --> 02:05:24.725
maybe I, I'll make a motion

2011
02:05:24.725 --> 02:05:26.645
and we'll see if we then continue the discussion.

2012
02:05:26.985 --> 02:05:31.125
Um, so I'll move that we approve resolution 2024 slash 25

2013
02:05:31.125 --> 02:05:32.765
dash 19, notice of vacancy

2014
02:05:32.765 --> 02:05:35.245
and trustee area three for provisional appointment.

2015
02:05:39.895 --> 02:05:43.735
I will second. Okay.

2016
02:05:43.755 --> 02:05:46.535
We have a motion and a second. Any other motions?

2017
02:05:48.275 --> 02:05:51.375
Um, no, I would like to go on a record that I,

2018
02:05:51.955 --> 02:05:52.975
in my opinion,

2019
02:05:53.155 --> 02:05:54.255
and this is just my opinion,

2020
02:05:55.295 --> 02:06:00.175
I think on this particular item, um, item, uh,

2021
02:06:00.245 --> 02:06:03.455
trustee quo should be abstaining just

2022
02:06:03.455 --> 02:06:05.895
because it's, it's his vacancy.

2023
02:06:06.035 --> 02:06:07.415
But that's just my opinion.

2024
02:06:08.585 --> 02:06:10.765
Can I just clarify because he's not resigning.

2025
02:06:10.795 --> 02:06:14.275
It's not like he, his term is ending it.

2026
02:06:14.395 --> 02:06:16.035
I feel like it would be Trustee Clark

2027
02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:18.155
that couldn't be voting on this, that,

2028
02:06:18.265 --> 02:06:22.355
that is my interpretation of it is in that trustee quos

2029
02:06:24.065 --> 02:06:25.675
term has ended, my term has ended.

2030
02:06:26.505 --> 02:06:27.645
So then we're going forward.

2031
02:06:28.225 --> 02:06:30.765
So I don't know why he couldn't vote

2032
02:06:30.765 --> 02:06:31.965
on something. 'cause he's,

2033
02:06:32.475 --> 02:06:35.325
Because we would all normally do this if there's a vacancy

2034
02:06:35.325 --> 02:06:36.845
right now, there's no vacancy.

2035
02:06:36.905 --> 02:06:38.965
If he there was a vacancy, he wouldn't be here.

2036
02:06:39.675 --> 02:06:41.685
It's that, it's that circular logic.

2037
02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:47.245
Okay. Um, I hear what you're saying

2038
02:06:47.465 --> 02:06:48.605
and we've never been here before.

2039
02:06:48.605 --> 02:06:50.285
You're right. Because we've never had a situation

2040
02:06:50.285 --> 02:06:53.885
where the person who resigned was in this weird in between,

2041
02:06:53.885 --> 02:06:55.285
between this August and December.

2042
02:06:55.545 --> 02:06:56.845
So we have to make our own rules

2043
02:06:56.865 --> 02:06:57.885
and we can't just not,

2044
02:06:58.015 --> 02:07:00.125
we're not making it very clear that was a very bad boarding.

2045
02:07:00.175 --> 02:07:01.485
We're not making our own rules.

2046
02:07:01.985 --> 02:07:05.725
We are figuring out the way that we want to proceed to abide

2047
02:07:05.945 --> 02:07:07.285
by the law and the rules.

2048
02:07:07.865 --> 02:07:10.125
Um, but we, you know, while we like

2049
02:07:10.125 --> 02:07:12.405
to look towards the past, this is a unique situation.

2050
02:07:12.405 --> 02:07:14.285
We just haven't been in one like this before.

2051
02:07:14.745 --> 02:07:18.645
Um, I, I can understand both sides of it.

2052
02:07:18.825 --> 02:07:20.485
Um, one of my questions was,

2053
02:07:20.545 --> 02:07:21.805
and I, I think I know the answer,

2054
02:07:21.825 --> 02:07:24.925
but I just want it stated, um, when it act,

2055
02:07:25.065 --> 02:07:28.525
if we decided on dec, December 17th is the day we are going

2056
02:07:28.525 --> 02:07:33.205
to, um, review the people who want to be appointed

2057
02:07:33.385 --> 02:07:35.285
and make that decision in the meeting,

2058
02:07:35.945 --> 02:07:38.125
it would be the new trustee.

2059
02:07:38.305 --> 02:07:40.525
So it would be four trustees, three of us,

2060
02:07:40.785 --> 02:07:42.445
and the new trustee for area one.

2061
02:07:42.445 --> 02:07:44.485
Is that accurate? Who would be voting on it? That's

2062
02:07:44.485 --> 02:07:45.165
Correct. Okay.

2063
02:07:45.195 --> 02:07:47.045
Because if in any way we were stating

2064
02:07:47.075 --> 02:07:49.005
that Trustee Quo got a vote on that,

2065
02:07:49.125 --> 02:07:50.605
I would be adamantly against that.

2066
02:07:50.705 --> 02:07:55.085
So that's why I think it's okay if he votes on the process

2067
02:07:55.385 --> 02:07:59.685
for it, but absolutely not getting a vote on, um,

2068
02:08:00.025 --> 02:08:01.125
who fills the position.

2069
02:08:01.125 --> 02:08:03.365
Just like President Pel shouldn't have a vote on it

2070
02:08:03.365 --> 02:08:06.205
because, um, it's for the new, the new board.

2071
02:08:06.305 --> 02:08:07.405
So that was my first question.

2072
02:08:07.865 --> 02:08:12.605
Um, and then, um, what if this passes, what is the plan

2073
02:08:12.625 --> 02:08:14.125
for the district to do to advertise,

2074
02:08:14.125 --> 02:08:15.685
like I already mentioned the, um,

2075
02:08:15.685 --> 02:08:18.045
local publications have started the process for you,

2076
02:08:18.105 --> 02:08:20.925
but what is the district's plan to make sure

2077
02:08:20.925 --> 02:08:23.845
that area three folks, both parents who we have,

2078
02:08:23.905 --> 02:08:26.005
but like broader than parents, know

2079
02:08:26.005 --> 02:08:27.965
that this opportunity is available to them?

2080
02:08:29.545 --> 02:08:33.245
So we will advertise in, um, uh,

2081
02:08:33.645 --> 02:08:34.685
probably two newspapers.

2082
02:08:35.025 --> 02:08:37.365
One being Livermore and the other one being Pleasanton.

2083
02:08:37.705 --> 02:08:40.365
We will put it on our district website

2084
02:08:40.505 --> 02:08:43.605
and we will put it on all the schools within bound, uh,

2085
02:08:43.605 --> 02:08:45.205
area three on their websites.

2086
02:08:45.625 --> 02:08:48.405
Uh, we will actually look at what the cost would be

2087
02:08:48.465 --> 02:08:51.285
to do a radio ad, uh, on local radio.

2088
02:08:53.655 --> 02:08:56.395
And then would we send a note, do we have an ability

2089
02:08:56.415 --> 02:09:00.975
to send a note specifically to parents in area three, like

2090
02:09:00.975 --> 02:09:02.055
through Parents Square or something?

2091
02:09:02.355 --> 02:09:04.295
We can send it to current parents to, I know,

2092
02:09:04.355 --> 02:09:05.775
but not the greater, obviously

2093
02:09:05.775 --> 02:09:06.775
Yes. Community, but I, I'm

2094
02:09:06.775 --> 02:09:07.375
just, yes.

2095
02:09:07.935 --> 02:09:09.615
I mean, you, you hit on the broader community,

2096
02:09:09.635 --> 02:09:13.015
but then obviously we do have emails for current parents.

2097
02:09:13.085 --> 02:09:16.375
Correct. So we could also send an an email directly

2098
02:09:16.395 --> 02:09:17.895
to Yes. Area three.

2099
02:09:18.275 --> 02:09:20.255
Yes. And it will be in the Friday update

2100
02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:22.135
that goes out across the district.

2101
02:09:24.055 --> 02:09:27.095
Okay. Thank you. Okay, trustee

2102
02:09:27.095 --> 02:09:28.095
Blackman.

2103
02:09:28.195 --> 02:09:29.495
So I wanna share a process

2104
02:09:29.605 --> 02:09:30.815
that happened a couple years ago.

2105
02:09:31.315 --> 02:09:34.295
Joe Gini announced that he was stepping down from the board.

2106
02:09:35.075 --> 02:09:36.535
The board knew about it ahead of time,

2107
02:09:37.435 --> 02:09:39.495
but he didn't file the paperwork right then.

2108
02:09:39.755 --> 02:09:41.575
He actually sat on it, waited for weeks,

2109
02:09:42.315 --> 02:09:45.095
and at which point he actually submitted the paperwork

2110
02:09:45.095 --> 02:09:48.055
to the county is when the board actually acted

2111
02:09:48.475 --> 02:09:49.615
to actually determine whether

2112
02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:51.335
or not there would be an appointment or an election.

2113
02:09:52.155 --> 02:09:54.215
So I just wanna be mindful, we've actually been in this

2114
02:09:54.215 --> 02:09:56.495
place before and we followed the actual due

2115
02:09:56.495 --> 02:09:57.695
process that's been laid out.

2116
02:09:57.795 --> 02:09:59.775
We did not act in advance knowing that

2117
02:09:59.775 --> 02:10:02.575
that individual was stepping down to have him engage

2118
02:10:02.575 --> 02:10:03.815
and the discussion about

2119
02:10:03.815 --> 02:10:05.935
what would happen when his seat is vacant.

2120
02:10:06.355 --> 02:10:08.935
He was actually not in the seat when the determination was

2121
02:10:08.965 --> 02:10:11.055
made as to how to proceed going forward.

2122
02:10:11.755 --> 02:10:12.815
So I just wanna be clear

2123
02:10:12.925 --> 02:10:15.415
that this would be not following our typical

2124
02:10:15.415 --> 02:10:16.735
process that we've used.

2125
02:10:18.295 --> 02:10:20.415
I can agree with that, but I also feel like there is,

2126
02:10:20.485 --> 02:10:23.895
this is a very unique situation in terms of the timing

2127
02:10:24.315 --> 02:10:26.255
as the beginning of a reorganization

2128
02:10:26.835 --> 02:10:30.615
and the timing of a need to pass a,

2129
02:10:31.495 --> 02:10:34.765
a reduced budget and make RIF reduction in force

2130
02:10:35.545 --> 02:10:38.685
and all of that in time to be compliant with the law.

2131
02:10:38.745 --> 02:10:42.445
So I think there is, there is an urgency, um,

2132
02:10:43.545 --> 02:10:45.755
that may not have existed in other circum.

2133
02:10:45.995 --> 02:10:48.595
I mean, there's been very different in circumstances. Okay.

2134
02:10:48.595 --> 02:10:50.995
At this point we have an agenda on the, on the table,

2135
02:10:51.755 --> 02:10:52.835
I mean a motion on the table.

2136
02:10:53.415 --> 02:10:56.235
Um, are there any other, um, motions people would like

2137
02:10:56.235 --> 02:10:57.435
to make before I call for a vote?

2138
02:11:02.715 --> 02:11:05.205
Okay. And then I will, let's do this individually just

2139
02:11:05.365 --> 02:11:07.605
'cause of everything that's gone on. Can, can you repeat

2140
02:11:07.605 --> 02:11:08.605
The motion please?

2141
02:11:08.665 --> 02:11:11.085
Um, the motion was from Trustee Spec seconded

2142
02:11:11.085 --> 02:11:13.245
by trustee quo to pass the resolution

2143
02:11:14.065 --> 02:11:18.645
24 25 dash 19 as presented, correct? Thank

2144
02:11:18.645 --> 02:11:19.645
You. That is correct. And,

2145
02:11:19.645 --> 02:11:21.685
and in the resolution, it does not say

2146
02:11:23.295 --> 02:11:27.105
the date we would vote on it, right?

2147
02:11:29.145 --> 02:11:31.605
Dec, December 17th is not, it just says

2148
02:11:31.605 --> 02:11:33.645
that we would advertise, um,

2149
02:11:35.845 --> 02:11:37.595
for the vacancy.

2150
02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:42.885
It, it does not, um, correct.

2151
02:11:42.945 --> 02:11:45.005
The second piece when I introduced this was

2152
02:11:45.005 --> 02:11:47.125
to get direction on whether the board wanted

2153
02:11:47.145 --> 02:11:48.925
to take action on the 17th

2154
02:11:49.225 --> 02:11:52.365
or, uh, uh, a special board meeting

2155
02:11:52.365 --> 02:11:53.885
before the first board meeting in January,

2156
02:11:54.225 --> 02:11:55.965
or at that first board meeting in January.

2157
02:11:57.775 --> 02:12:02.585
Okay. So if this passes, well, I guess regardless

2158
02:12:02.605 --> 02:12:04.265
of it, we, we have to do something someday.

2159
02:12:04.845 --> 02:12:08.175
If this passes, will we then talk about

2160
02:12:08.555 --> 02:12:09.735
and give you that direction

2161
02:12:10.005 --> 02:12:11.535
that you take from the majority of the board?

2162
02:12:11.535 --> 02:12:12.655
Or do we vote?

2163
02:12:12.655 --> 02:12:15.265
How do we get to that resolution

2164
02:12:15.525 --> 02:12:18.095
or that agreement?

2165
02:12:20.225 --> 02:12:23.835
Well, I, I will ideally, I like the board, uh, to vote

2166
02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:25.635
to take action, but consensus would work,

2167
02:12:25.795 --> 02:12:28.355
I can bring it back on December 3rd if the board wants

2168
02:12:28.695 --> 02:12:29.915
to have time to think about it.

2169
02:12:30.135 --> 02:12:32.595
Uh, but the board would have to approve adding,

2170
02:12:33.415 --> 02:12:35.715
um, that agenda item. Okay.

2171
02:12:36.055 --> 02:12:38.395
All right. So the current motion is only this resolution

2172
02:12:42.725 --> 02:12:44.415
Trustee Blackman and then Trustee Paul.

2173
02:12:45.075 --> 02:12:48.135
So a couple items here on this resolution,

2174
02:12:48.135 --> 02:12:50.775
it makes statements that actually conflict with one another.

2175
02:12:51.115 --> 02:12:53.295
Um, and the, whereas Mr.

2176
02:12:53.325 --> 02:12:55.255
Clark's written resignation was submitted

2177
02:12:55.255 --> 02:12:58.175
to the Dell Unified School District on the October 16th date

2178
02:12:58.225 --> 02:13:01.055
prior to the commencement of his term as Area three trustee.

2179
02:13:01.995 --> 02:13:04.295
We make all these statements about his resignation,

2180
02:13:04.515 --> 02:13:05.615
but in effect,

2181
02:13:05.675 --> 02:13:07.615
he can only resign if he's actually a board member.

2182
02:13:08.075 --> 02:13:09.935
And in section one it says the above

2183
02:13:09.935 --> 02:13:11.255
or settles are all true and correct.

2184
02:13:12.035 --> 02:13:16.295
So we have conflicts, we can't possibly approve section one

2185
02:13:16.295 --> 02:13:17.455
because we know it's not,

2186
02:13:17.605 --> 02:13:19.375
he's not a board member when he's resigning.

2187
02:13:23.485 --> 02:13:25.645
I mean, the reason why I don't think this is clean is

2188
02:13:25.645 --> 02:13:27.205
because the resolution's just not clean.

2189
02:13:37.935 --> 02:13:42.195
So the main goal of this resolution is to announce vacancy

2190
02:13:42.335 --> 02:13:46.255
and start the provisional appointment paperwork,

2191
02:13:46.395 --> 02:13:49.295
if you will, like, maybe obtain applications

2192
02:13:49.315 --> 02:13:53.095
and get parents aware of or possible candidates aware of.

2193
02:13:53.515 --> 02:13:58.175
Um, is there,

2194
02:14:01.005 --> 02:14:02.225
is there a language that we can change,

2195
02:14:02.225 --> 02:14:03.705
like maybe change a few words here

2196
02:14:03.705 --> 02:14:04.825
to make it more compliant?

2197
02:14:04.885 --> 02:14:07.905
And then just has this resolution be passed?

2198
02:14:08.425 --> 02:14:11.025
I mean, when I read, whereas Jeff Clark's written

2199
02:14:11.025 --> 02:14:12.425
resignation was submitted

2200
02:14:12.425 --> 02:14:16.185
to the Dublin Unified School District on October 16th, 2024,

2201
02:14:16.515 --> 02:14:18.945
prior to the commencement of his term

2202
02:14:19.125 --> 02:14:21.945
as the area three trustee, that is a truthful statement.

2203
02:14:26.185 --> 02:14:27.105
I don't see a conflict.

2204
02:14:27.815 --> 02:14:29.345
Okay. I think we need to vote on this.

2205
02:14:29.585 --> 02:14:31.985
I do think there needs to be, depending on the outcome

2206
02:14:31.985 --> 02:14:35.855
of this vote, there needs to be a discussion as to dates,

2207
02:14:36.875 --> 02:14:39.255
but I think that is dependent on the outcome of this vote.

2208
02:14:39.255 --> 02:14:43.295
So I'm gonna call for a vote. Trustee PEs 20. Aye.

2209
02:14:43.565 --> 02:14:46.095
Trustee spec? Aye. Trustee Blackman?

2210
02:14:46.435 --> 02:14:49.135
No. Trustee Cherrier? No. Trustee quo.

2211
02:14:49.835 --> 02:14:54.035
Aye. And I vote, aye. So this passes is three to two.

2212
02:14:54.775 --> 02:14:57.605
Um, I believe

2213
02:15:02.945 --> 02:15:07.345
we need to come up with a consensus on the timing, um,

2214
02:15:07.805 --> 02:15:12.195
of when this, when the provisional appointment would occur.

2215
02:15:13.495 --> 02:15:17.995
Um, and I would defer to the three continuing trustees

2216
02:15:18.735 --> 02:15:21.365
in terms of, um,

2217
02:15:22.935 --> 02:15:24.365
would it be on the 17th?

2218
02:15:25.145 --> 02:15:28.445
Do you wish to do a special board meeting in January

2219
02:15:28.745 --> 02:15:30.285
or do you wish to do a

2220
02:15:31.535 --> 02:15:33.355
do it at the regular meeting in January?

2221
02:15:41.005 --> 02:15:42.335
Well, I mean, I think I've said I'd,

2222
02:15:42.335 --> 02:15:43.415
I'd prefer to do it on the 17th.

2223
02:15:43.635 --> 02:15:46.055
Um, otherwise I just think it's a short meeting.

2224
02:15:46.195 --> 02:15:49.135
We welcome our new trustee, we thank our outgoing,

2225
02:15:49.235 --> 02:15:52.975
and then I just wait till the next meeting to do much

2226
02:15:52.975 --> 02:15:55.295
because I wouldn't, I, I just think it's a waste of time

2227
02:15:55.295 --> 02:15:57.695
to talk the organizational piece without the fifth member.

2228
02:15:57.875 --> 02:15:59.895
But, so that's, that's my feeling.

2229
02:16:00.965 --> 02:16:01.975
Trustee Blackman,

2230
02:16:02.695 --> 02:16:04.375
I so, uh, make a point of order.

2231
02:16:04.845 --> 02:16:07.015
Unfortunately, when we passed the resolution,

2232
02:16:07.165 --> 02:16:10.255
that would've been the time to have actually made a proposal

2233
02:16:10.435 --> 02:16:12.575
to actually put a date on the provisional appointment

2234
02:16:13.355 --> 02:16:14.415
as it was not done.

2235
02:16:14.915 --> 02:16:17.295
Our action is done with this item.

2236
02:16:18.245 --> 02:16:20.475
Sorry, we didn't put on the agenda item

2237
02:16:20.575 --> 02:16:23.115
to determine the date for the appointment.

2238
02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:25.755
We just asked to approve the resolution.

2239
02:16:26.035 --> 02:16:28.315
I was hoping if somebody was going to make a motion,

2240
02:16:28.315 --> 02:16:31.245
they would've actually made the motion to include the date

2241
02:16:31.245 --> 02:16:32.365
of when this would actually,

2242
02:16:32.465 --> 02:16:33.925
the provisional appointment would occur.

2243
02:16:33.925 --> 02:16:37.125
But that did not happen. So we're done with this item.

2244
02:16:37.945 --> 02:16:40.485
Can we, as those who voted for it,

2245
02:16:40.505 --> 02:16:43.535
we can vote to reopen?

2246
02:16:44.835 --> 02:16:46.775
We can correct. There's a

2247
02:16:46.925 --> 02:16:51.785
That is correct, because you were in the

2248
02:16:51.985 --> 02:16:54.965
majority, so you can reopen it.

2249
02:16:56.525 --> 02:16:57.805
I can make a motion to open it.

2250
02:17:01.225 --> 02:17:02.995
Yeah, why don't you motion, you can motion

2251
02:17:02.995 --> 02:17:04.235
to reopen it since it was your motion.

2252
02:17:04.665 --> 02:17:07.625
I'll make a motion to o

2253
02:17:07.625 --> 02:17:12.445
reopen so we can pick a date. Re this item.

2254
02:17:13.075 --> 02:17:16.445
I'll second. And the, it has

2255
02:17:16.445 --> 02:17:18.765
to be those that approved the motion. I believe so.

2256
02:17:18.785 --> 02:17:23.685
So, so basically it's not reopening it is to, it is

2257
02:17:23.745 --> 02:17:27.525
to get rid of the last motion, like it never

2258
02:17:27.525 --> 02:17:28.965
Strike that previous motion and to,

2259
02:17:29.145 --> 02:17:30.645
and we start all over, start a new motion.

2260
02:17:31.035 --> 02:17:32.375
Okay. So

2261
02:17:32.525 --> 02:17:36.535
I'll make a motion to, to strike the last motion.

2262
02:17:38.805 --> 02:17:42.155
I'll second. And the three of us that need that voted

2263
02:17:42.215 --> 02:17:43.475
for it need to approve it.

2264
02:17:43.505 --> 02:17:48.315
Correct. So I, aye, aye. Okay. Now I'll take a new motion.

2265
02:17:48.755 --> 02:17:52.075
I would like, I mean, I know you guys voted against it

2266
02:17:52.075 --> 02:17:53.075
and are against at this point,

2267
02:17:53.215 --> 02:17:55.785
but do you have feedback on

2268
02:17:58.005 --> 02:17:59.245
December, January or January?

2269
02:18:00.225 --> 02:18:03.985
My concern, I'm sorry, I didn't raise my hand. Okay.

2270
02:18:04.405 --> 02:18:06.905
Um, my concern is,

2271
02:18:07.265 --> 02:18:10.185
I just wanna make sure all the i's are dotted

2272
02:18:10.185 --> 02:18:15.065
and t's crossed that we really do have a vacancy on the

2273
02:18:15.065 --> 02:18:18.145
17th because I would hate to be appointing someone

2274
02:18:18.535 --> 02:18:19.985
because to me,

2275
02:18:20.485 --> 02:18:24.975
and this is my interpretation of,

2276
02:18:26.305 --> 02:18:30.125
of, uh, 9 0 5 1, I mean 5 0 9 1,

2277
02:18:31.805 --> 02:18:33.745
it, a vacancy has to occur.

2278
02:18:35.045 --> 02:18:37.885
I have seen nothing here that is legally binding

2279
02:18:37.885 --> 02:18:39.205
to say we have a vacancy.

2280
02:18:39.225 --> 02:18:43.605
Now, Mr. Funk is saying if he's not seated on the 17th,

2281
02:18:43.795 --> 02:18:47.225
that automatically makes a vacancy,

2282
02:18:47.445 --> 02:18:50.105
but that won't happen until the end of that meeting.

2283
02:18:50.195 --> 02:18:54.785
Right? So to do it on the 17th, I think

2284
02:18:56.015 --> 02:18:58.485
we're appointed someone to a seat that's already full.

2285
02:18:59.585 --> 02:19:03.565
So there's no vacancy and I, I think we're running fast

2286
02:19:03.625 --> 02:19:04.685
and loose with the rules.

2287
02:19:06.045 --> 02:19:10.585
Um, if, if we could get Mr. Clark

2288
02:19:10.645 --> 02:19:14.745
to submit the correct resignation letter, file it

2289
02:19:14.745 --> 02:19:18.625
with the county board, I'd have no problem with the 17th

2290
02:19:19.165 --> 02:19:20.225
of the resignation letter.

2291
02:19:20.255 --> 02:19:24.585
Effective, you know, the 17th or the 16th.

2292
02:19:24.655 --> 02:19:27.025
It'd, you're saying that as soon as on

2293
02:19:27.085 --> 02:19:29.685
that Friday when the certification happens, then he's,

2294
02:19:29.875 --> 02:19:31.165
he's a trustee at that point.

2295
02:19:31.555 --> 02:19:34.885
Okay. Uh, I've never seen this thing about him having

2296
02:19:34.905 --> 02:19:36.485
to be seated, so if you could gimme

2297
02:19:36.485 --> 02:19:37.805
that information, that would be great.

2298
02:19:37.925 --> 02:19:40.085
I just don't, you know, there's a lot of ed code

2299
02:19:40.085 --> 02:19:41.725
that it's hard to follow at all.

2300
02:19:42.105 --> 02:19:46.825
Um, so to me,

2301
02:19:48.435 --> 02:19:52.905
until that little detail is, is handled,

2302
02:19:53.325 --> 02:19:56.705
I'm very uncomfortable actually

2303
02:19:57.265 --> 02:19:58.665
choosing the person we appoint.

2304
02:19:59.685 --> 02:20:02.745
Um, and, uh,

2305
02:20:04.565 --> 02:20:07.505
you know, um, I would probably not be able to vote

2306
02:20:07.505 --> 02:20:11.535
for anybody until I was assured that, um,

2307
02:20:12.925 --> 02:20:15.495
that we have, um, a vacancy.

2308
02:20:15.795 --> 02:20:17.495
And at that point I would not be assured

2309
02:20:17.495 --> 02:20:19.695
unless something else has happened in the meantime.

2310
02:20:20.285 --> 02:20:21.775
Trustee quote, and then just

2311
02:20:22.515 --> 02:20:25.015
So let's please this out on the 17th,

2312
02:20:25.895 --> 02:20:28.055
everyone's gathered here and Jeff Clark does not show.

2313
02:20:28.055 --> 02:20:30.535
Does that qualify? I mean, is that enough for you to realize

2314
02:20:30.535 --> 02:20:32.815
that there is a vacancy at that moment?

2315
02:20:34.435 --> 02:20:36.325
He's never submitted a resignation letter

2316
02:20:36.465 --> 02:20:39.285
and I'm not, I, it is not that I'm doubting Mr.

2317
02:20:39.475 --> 02:20:41.085
Funk, but I've never seen in here

2318
02:20:41.085 --> 02:20:42.045
where it says if we don't see

2319
02:20:42.125 --> 02:20:43.285
them, he's no longer a trustee.

2320
02:20:44.105 --> 02:20:47.645
All I've seen is that if he doesn't fulfill

2321
02:20:48.745 --> 02:20:51.445
the duties of his job for 90 days,

2322
02:20:51.555 --> 02:20:53.765
then he's automatically off the board that's in there.

2323
02:20:54.185 --> 02:20:56.045
And, and that's definitely in there,

2324
02:20:56.745 --> 02:20:59.445
but I've never seen this thing about not being seated and,

2325
02:20:59.945 --> 02:21:03.325
and you know, in the list of reasons why,

2326
02:21:03.465 --> 02:21:05.445
you can say someone's not on the board,

2327
02:21:05.665 --> 02:21:07.165
that's not one of those lists.

2328
02:21:07.185 --> 02:21:09.965
So there must be some other ED code where it's at.

2329
02:21:11.065 --> 02:21:14.245
Um, you know, I I would think

2330
02:21:14.245 --> 02:21:16.365
that if he doesn't submit a resignation letter,

2331
02:21:16.465 --> 02:21:18.605
we don't have a vacancy for 90 days.

2332
02:21:18.625 --> 02:21:20.205
That's the way I read the ED code.

2333
02:21:21.845 --> 02:21:22.825
So the letter And that

2334
02:21:22.825 --> 02:21:23.865
letter is not sufficient for you.

2335
02:21:24.805 --> 02:21:27.305
The letter, he hasn't given us a valid letter yet.

2336
02:21:27.525 --> 02:21:29.545
He has given a letter dated effective

2337
02:21:29.545 --> 02:21:30.705
immediately for something.

2338
02:21:30.705 --> 02:21:32.825
He's not even a trustee for it. So

2339
02:21:32.825 --> 02:21:34.745
If we had, if we had a revised letter, would you be

2340
02:21:35.645 --> 02:21:38.545
I'm all for it always has to do, submit something to the,

2341
02:21:39.325 --> 02:21:42.105
to the superintendent of education saying effective

2342
02:21:43.145 --> 02:21:45.625
December 17th, I hereby resign being a trustee.

2343
02:21:46.845 --> 02:21:47.845
That's good to go.

2344
02:21:50.195 --> 02:21:51.335
So I appreciate that feedback.

2345
02:21:51.455 --> 02:21:52.975
I could adjust that in the motion

2346
02:21:53.355 --> 02:21:54.655
to put that piece of information

2347
02:21:56.195 --> 02:21:59.485
Trustee Blackman, and then I'll let Trustee spec

2348
02:21:59.485 --> 02:22:00.485
Me there. Hi. So I

2349
02:22:00.485 --> 02:22:02.485
was just going back, I know we paused for a moment

2350
02:22:02.545 --> 02:22:04.365
to get the date in there, but I,

2351
02:22:04.525 --> 02:22:06.605
I was reading our actual agenda item

2352
02:22:06.905 --> 02:22:10.525
and it states that Mr. Clark is automatically seated unless,

2353
02:22:11.105 --> 02:22:12.765
and until he resigns that seat,

2354
02:22:12.825 --> 02:22:15.165
Mr. Clark has submitted his resignation in this case,

2355
02:22:15.185 --> 02:22:18.405
the resignation could not be effective before he has.

2356
02:22:18.625 --> 02:22:19.645
He was to take office.

2357
02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:22.165
The organizational meeting will trigger

2358
02:22:22.225 --> 02:22:26.535
the vacancy for area three. So,

2359
02:22:26.795 --> 02:22:29.175
So we're not voting to appoint anyone yet,

2360
02:22:29.555 --> 02:22:30.815
but we know it's coming,

2361
02:22:31.965 --> 02:22:32.965
So, right. But it's

2362
02:22:32.965 --> 02:22:34.025
gonna trigger the vacancy.

2363
02:22:34.045 --> 02:22:36.305
And again, I will state, you know, I'm not gonna vote

2364
02:22:36.305 --> 02:22:37.705
for this, but I will state again that all

2365
02:22:37.705 --> 02:22:40.345
of the documents I've read to date with our policies

2366
02:22:40.345 --> 02:22:42.305
and bylaws state that there has to be a vacancy for us

2367
02:22:42.305 --> 02:22:43.465
to move forward with any of this.

2368
02:22:43.965 --> 02:22:44.965
So,

2369
02:22:45.895 --> 02:22:46.895
Okay.

2370
02:22:46.895 --> 02:22:48.545
Trustee Speck, do you wanna make a new motion?

2371
02:22:49.705 --> 02:22:52.845
Yes, I do. I would like to make a motion

2372
02:22:53.705 --> 02:22:58.205
to approve resolution 2024 slash 25 dash 19 notice

2373
02:22:58.225 --> 02:22:59.605
of vacancy in trustee area.

2374
02:22:59.655 --> 02:23:03.845
Three provisional appointment with specified dates of,

2375
02:23:06.915 --> 02:23:10.945
um, voting in a new trustee

2376
02:23:12.205 --> 02:23:15.645
on December 17th, pending

2377
02:23:16.465 --> 02:23:19.125
an official letter from Mr. Clark

2378
02:23:19.345 --> 02:23:23.325
to the county superintendent stating he resigns effective

2379
02:23:26.155 --> 02:23:27.315
December 14th or 17th.

2380
02:23:27.415 --> 02:23:28.955
I'm a little unclear which the date it is,

2381
02:23:29.615 --> 02:23:32.395
but the appropriate date in December.

2382
02:23:33.955 --> 02:23:35.905
Okay, one second. Second.

2383
02:23:36.645 --> 02:23:38.105
All right, so we have a motion and a second.

2384
02:23:38.285 --> 02:23:39.745
Did you get all that, Vicky?

2385
02:23:39.895 --> 02:23:43.825
Okay, I'm gonna call for vote Trustee pe aye. Trustee spec?

2386
02:23:44.085 --> 02:23:46.985
Aye. Trustee Blackman? No. Trustee chair?

2387
02:23:47.605 --> 02:23:50.665
No for the other reasons. Trustee Quo Aye.

2388
02:23:50.925 --> 02:23:52.265
And President Pellum. Aye.

2389
02:23:54.645 --> 02:23:59.505
Um, and kind of directing staff to reach out to

2390
02:24:00.205 --> 02:24:03.105
Mr. Clark, um, regarding the request for an updated letter.

2391
02:24:03.895 --> 02:24:05.225
Will do. Okay.

2392
02:24:06.135 --> 02:24:08.305
Alright, we got like two more things

2393
02:24:08.325 --> 02:24:09.705
and then we still have all the data walks.

2394
02:24:09.705 --> 02:24:13.025
So if we can see if we can get through these next two, um,

2395
02:24:13.045 --> 02:24:14.505
and then take a break before data walk.

2396
02:24:14.605 --> 02:24:16.825
Is everybody good with that? Okay.

2397
02:24:17.085 --> 02:24:19.505
Um, we have a letter of engagement, um, from the city

2398
02:24:19.505 --> 02:24:21.625
of Dublin regarding the sports, the softball

2399
02:24:21.625 --> 02:24:23.185
and baseball fields at Fallon.

2400
02:24:24.375 --> 02:24:26.505
Yeah. I'm excited to bring forward this letter

2401
02:24:26.505 --> 02:24:28.665
of engagement from the city of Dublin.

2402
02:24:28.885 --> 02:24:32.825
Um, we have come to a tentative agreement, um,

2403
02:24:33.815 --> 02:24:37.025
that Emerald High School will have priority access

2404
02:24:37.125 --> 02:24:38.825
to the softball and baseball field,

2405
02:24:38.825 --> 02:24:42.625
the 90 foot baseball field at Fallon Sports Complex.

2406
02:24:43.565 --> 02:24:48.345
And in return for that priority, um, of those fields,

2407
02:24:48.685 --> 02:24:52.865
uh, the, the district will pay for the cost to

2408
02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:56.705
transform two little league fields into softball fields

2409
02:24:57.365 --> 02:25:01.345
and to extend, uh, the current baseball field

2410
02:25:01.365 --> 02:25:03.705
to 90 feet at Imel Glen Park.

2411
02:25:04.525 --> 02:25:08.825
Um, this would also require putting in a new backstop, um,

2412
02:25:09.285 --> 02:25:11.505
for the two so, uh, softball fields.

2413
02:25:12.245 --> 02:25:14.465
Um, so I'm very excited to bring this forward.

2414
02:25:14.805 --> 02:25:18.625
Um, and, uh, as you can see in the letter, uh,

2415
02:25:18.885 --> 02:25:21.265
the city understands the importance

2416
02:25:21.265 --> 02:25:23.485
that this is not a short term fix,

2417
02:25:23.625 --> 02:25:26.845
but a long-term, uh, solution for Emerald High School.

2418
02:25:28.905 --> 02:25:31.045
So this isn't, this is just a discussion item.

2419
02:25:31.145 --> 02:25:33.365
Are there any questions, trustee speck?

2420
02:25:33.785 --> 02:25:35.045
Um, yes, I have two questions.

2421
02:25:35.045 --> 02:25:36.525
Well, first I just wanna say thank you.

2422
02:25:36.525 --> 02:25:38.645
I know that this has been work, um, with you,

2423
02:25:38.645 --> 02:25:40.325
superintendent Funk and the city,

2424
02:25:40.425 --> 02:25:42.885
and I think that this is the right thing for this community.

2425
02:25:43.055 --> 02:25:44.245
These fields are much closer

2426
02:25:44.425 --> 02:25:47.205
and I think that they're gonna be much happier to be able

2427
02:25:47.205 --> 02:25:48.325
to be at Fallon Sports Park.

2428
02:25:48.745 --> 02:25:49.845
Um, my two questions.

2429
02:25:49.865 --> 02:25:52.445
The first, um, in the document it says beginning

2430
02:25:52.445 --> 02:25:53.845
25, 26 school year.

2431
02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:56.165
What about this spring? The 24 25 school year?

2432
02:25:56.755 --> 02:25:59.805
Yeah, so it doesn't say, uh, school year says season.

2433
02:26:00.265 --> 02:26:03.285
And so the 25 season begins this spring.

2434
02:26:04.035 --> 02:26:07.955
Oh, okay. Beginning with the 25, 26 high school season.

2435
02:26:09.075 --> 02:26:10.965
Okay. It's kind of an odd way to word it, but,

2436
02:26:11.425 --> 02:26:12.525
but it begins with the 25

2437
02:26:12.525 --> 02:26:13.685
season is what you're trying to tell me?

2438
02:26:13.755 --> 02:26:15.165
That is correct. Okay. And there'll be a

2439
02:26:15.165 --> 02:26:16.565
second document that will come back.

2440
02:26:16.745 --> 02:26:18.845
One will have to do a field use agreement,

2441
02:26:19.305 --> 02:26:22.725
but, uh, there'll be a second, uh, document that comes back

2442
02:26:22.725 --> 02:26:23.805
because the cost

2443
02:26:24.185 --> 02:26:26.885
to transform those fields will be more than the limit

2444
02:26:26.885 --> 02:26:27.925
that I have to approve.

2445
02:26:27.985 --> 02:26:30.245
So the board will have to approve it ahead of time.

2446
02:26:30.635 --> 02:26:33.365
Okay. Then my other question was on the statement right

2447
02:26:33.365 --> 02:26:35.245
before the two bullet points about the fields,

2448
02:26:35.265 --> 02:26:37.005
it says the required changes include,

2449
02:26:37.185 --> 02:26:38.725
but are not limited to.

2450
02:26:39.345 --> 02:26:42.685
And that just felt like a very open-ended phrase

2451
02:26:42.755 --> 02:26:44.405
that made me a little concerned.

2452
02:26:44.965 --> 02:26:47.125
I realize, you know, that's gonna come back

2453
02:26:47.125 --> 02:26:50.365
with details in the cost, but just that, but not limited to.

2454
02:26:50.875 --> 02:26:52.125
Like, why is that in there and

2455
02:26:52.615 --> 02:26:53.615
Right. So,

2456
02:26:53.615 --> 02:26:57.245
um, I'm the one that originally suggested

2457
02:26:57.245 --> 02:26:58.925
that there's not a batting cage there.

2458
02:26:59.305 --> 02:27:03.245
And that, um, originally when we proposed using that

2459
02:27:03.245 --> 02:27:04.405
as emerald's home field,

2460
02:27:04.645 --> 02:27:07.805
I had put in a batting cage double no leak has said they

2461
02:27:07.805 --> 02:27:08.805
don't need a batting cage.

2462
02:27:09.305 --> 02:27:12.925
Um, however, uh, there may need to be a, a storage unit

2463
02:27:13.435 --> 02:27:16.365
installed so that they have access to equipment.

2464
02:27:16.385 --> 02:27:19.485
So that storage unit would be initial lease, uh,

2465
02:27:19.515 --> 02:27:20.845
that the district would pick up

2466
02:27:20.845 --> 02:27:23.805
because it would be, um, something added that

2467
02:27:24.435 --> 02:27:26.565
they already have at Fallon Sports Complex.

2468
02:27:27.265 --> 02:27:29.005
So it's not a huge cost,

2469
02:27:29.385 --> 02:27:33.765
but again, this is just that we have a, uh, an agreement,

2470
02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:35.125
a verbal agreement in place,

2471
02:27:35.145 --> 02:27:37.685
and the details will come back to the board for approval.

2472
02:27:37.795 --> 02:27:39.205
Okay. And then we would know the exact

2473
02:27:39.205 --> 02:27:40.405
costs when we have the details?

2474
02:27:40.405 --> 02:27:41.645
Correct. Okay. Thank you

2475
02:27:43.065 --> 02:27:45.075
Trustee Blackman All.

2476
02:27:45.095 --> 02:27:47.955
So thank you for, um, both your work on this along

2477
02:27:47.955 --> 02:27:49.035
with Dublin Lil League and the city.

2478
02:27:49.425 --> 02:27:51.195
It's important that we get this work done

2479
02:27:51.455 --> 02:27:52.515
to support the students.

2480
02:27:53.355 --> 02:27:55.035
I just wanna point out that, um,

2481
02:27:55.135 --> 02:27:57.795
in the original determination by the committee

2482
02:27:57.935 --> 02:28:00.315
to select the site for the high school,

2483
02:28:01.285 --> 02:28:03.515
these fields were actually part of the agreement.

2484
02:28:03.575 --> 02:28:05.835
And at that time, the city never made a point

2485
02:28:05.835 --> 02:28:06.955
of actually objecting to it.

2486
02:28:06.975 --> 02:28:08.635
So it's nice to see that it took a while,

2487
02:28:08.635 --> 02:28:09.715
but that it actually has come

2488
02:28:09.715 --> 02:28:11.555
around full circle and it's getting done.

2489
02:28:11.615 --> 02:28:13.275
So I appreciate all the work that went into it.

2490
02:28:13.615 --> 02:28:16.795
The one question I had, um, is that, so this was

2491
02:28:16.815 --> 02:28:18.555
for sports teams after school,

2492
02:28:18.775 --> 02:28:20.635
during practice, during sports season.

2493
02:28:21.465 --> 02:28:24.045
Um, presuming that Emerald, um,

2494
02:28:24.235 --> 02:28:26.685
high school will eventually grow to full capacity,

2495
02:28:27.225 --> 02:28:29.725
is there any anticipation that during the school day

2496
02:28:29.755 --> 02:28:32.525
that there would be the ability for pe um,

2497
02:28:33.065 --> 02:28:34.205
to use those fields

2498
02:28:34.345 --> 02:28:36.045
for those sports when they do those sports?

2499
02:28:36.185 --> 02:28:38.845
Or are we presuming we are only allowed

2500
02:28:38.845 --> 02:28:40.885
to use those fields after school?

2501
02:28:42.235 --> 02:28:45.205
This as currently agreed to

2502
02:28:45.225 --> 02:28:46.445
and discussed, it's just

2503
02:28:46.465 --> 02:28:48.125
for the athletic teams after school.

2504
02:28:49.255 --> 02:28:54.025
Thank you. All right, so this is not an action item.

2505
02:28:54.045 --> 02:28:55.345
So those are any other questions. Again,

2506
02:28:55.565 --> 02:28:57.505
we appreciate the collaboration with the city.

2507
02:28:58.085 --> 02:29:01.895
Um, I think this will be a good solution for everybody.

2508
02:29:02.835 --> 02:29:05.375
Um, and next up is regarding the fencing,

2509
02:29:05.815 --> 02:29:07.215
RFP for Dublin High.

2510
02:29:09.425 --> 02:29:11.685
Yes, Chris Hobbs will be presenting this.

2511
02:29:11.835 --> 02:29:14.085
Just as a reminder, um,

2512
02:29:14.425 --> 02:29:18.365
Dublin High School is the only school in our, uh, district

2513
02:29:18.365 --> 02:29:22.965
that does not have, um, um, fencing around its campus.

2514
02:29:23.605 --> 02:29:25.565
I know it's been a long standing issue.

2515
02:29:26.105 --> 02:29:28.565
Um, um, it, it

2516
02:29:30.185 --> 02:29:33.065
I get when we talk about the aesthetics of Dublin High

2517
02:29:33.065 --> 02:29:34.625
and putting a fence up, um,

2518
02:29:34.805 --> 02:29:38.505
but someone that has spent his extensive part of his career

2519
02:29:39.125 --> 02:29:41.025
in secondary, I've come from systems

2520
02:29:41.075 --> 02:29:42.145
where all the high schools

2521
02:29:42.245 --> 02:29:43.985
and middle schools had fencing around them

2522
02:29:44.515 --> 02:29:48.265
after the event that took place, uh, in the locker room, um,

2523
02:29:49.045 --> 02:29:51.225
in the first couple weeks of school.

2524
02:29:51.765 --> 02:29:55.505
Um, this just kind of raised that attention level, uh,

2525
02:29:55.605 --> 02:29:57.545
around security at Dublin High.

2526
02:29:58.085 --> 02:30:01.985
Um, and so tonight, uh, Mr. Hobbs will present

2527
02:30:02.005 --> 02:30:04.945
to you the RFP that is going out.

2528
02:30:05.405 --> 02:30:09.105
Um, and then ultimately we'll bring back a contract

2529
02:30:09.125 --> 02:30:11.065
for the board to approve, um,

2530
02:30:11.525 --> 02:30:13.625
in the near future. Mr. Hobbs.

2531
02:30:13.915 --> 02:30:15.945
Thank you Superintendent Funk for setting that up.

2532
02:30:15.945 --> 02:30:19.505
So well, um, again, board tonight what we're presenting

2533
02:30:19.505 --> 02:30:22.625
to you is the, uh, the basically the, uh, request

2534
02:30:22.645 --> 02:30:24.425
for proposals that's already out on the streets

2535
02:30:24.525 --> 02:30:27.105
and in fact, we'll be getting responses back, uh, this week.

2536
02:30:27.765 --> 02:30:29.945
Um, the goal is to fence in the campus

2537
02:30:30.085 --> 02:30:32.065
and to make it look more like our other schools.

2538
02:30:32.845 --> 02:30:33.985
The, uh,

2539
02:30:34.775 --> 02:30:36.905
picture we're showing right now shows the

2540
02:30:36.905 --> 02:30:38.585
approximate location of those fences.

2541
02:30:39.055 --> 02:30:40.585
I'll say straight up, I drew this,

2542
02:30:40.655 --> 02:30:42.665
this is not the actual RFP drawings.

2543
02:30:42.665 --> 02:30:44.345
They were much more detailed than this,

2544
02:30:44.365 --> 02:30:46.065
but we wanted to give you the big picture of

2545
02:30:46.415 --> 02:30:47.425
what we were looking to do.

2546
02:30:48.085 --> 02:30:51.865
Um, and the goal really is to be able to put a fence

2547
02:30:52.065 --> 02:30:56.105
around the entire, um, uh, campus in a way that allows us

2548
02:30:56.105 --> 02:30:58.985
to keep kids inside, keep everybody else outside,

2549
02:30:59.415 --> 02:31:02.265
have controlled access through gates, as well as

2550
02:31:02.265 --> 02:31:04.225
through buildings to get onto the campus.

2551
02:31:04.805 --> 02:31:06.865
Um, and really to provide that same level of security

2552
02:31:06.865 --> 02:31:08.905
and safety that we have at each of our other campuses.

2553
02:31:09.645 --> 02:31:11.985
Um, the, if you look at the drawing, you'll see

2554
02:31:11.985 --> 02:31:13.705
that we've done a couple of things that I think are gonna be

2555
02:31:13.705 --> 02:31:15.105
really effective for the school site.

2556
02:31:15.565 --> 02:31:17.865
Um, the administration building is still open

2557
02:31:17.865 --> 02:31:19.605
to the parking lot, so still opening

2558
02:31:19.665 --> 02:31:21.485
and welcoming to folks coming onto campus.

2559
02:31:21.485 --> 02:31:22.805
They'll go through the front office

2560
02:31:22.805 --> 02:31:24.605
before they go anywhere else on campus.

2561
02:31:25.345 --> 02:31:27.165
Um, same for the performing arts center.

2562
02:31:27.215 --> 02:31:29.085
We'll have the opening for the performing arts center

2563
02:31:29.085 --> 02:31:31.165
exposed to the outside so that when we have events

2564
02:31:31.165 --> 02:31:33.525
after school, they're not having to come through lock gates

2565
02:31:33.525 --> 02:31:35.605
to get into that public facility.

2566
02:31:36.785 --> 02:31:39.565
Um, not shown on here, of course, in the numerous gates

2567
02:31:39.565 --> 02:31:42.165
that we've got in, uh, strategic locations, our maintenance

2568
02:31:42.165 --> 02:31:45.245
and operation staff have walked the site with the principal

2569
02:31:45.245 --> 02:31:47.325
with students to really make sure

2570
02:31:47.325 --> 02:31:49.925
that they're building something that's effective for the,

2571
02:31:49.945 --> 02:31:51.845
the school and will be operable for the school.

2572
02:31:53.555 --> 02:31:55.025
Right now we're estimating the price

2573
02:31:55.045 --> 02:31:56.385
and of course we'll know, uh,

2574
02:31:56.385 --> 02:31:59.345
when we get bids back this week, um, of approximate price

2575
02:31:59.345 --> 02:32:01.745
between 850 and uh, million dollars.

2576
02:32:02.125 --> 02:32:03.825
Um, that's based really, um,

2577
02:32:03.925 --> 02:32:06.185
on our recent project at Fallon Middle School

2578
02:32:06.185 --> 02:32:08.145
where we installed fencing at the front of that campus.

2579
02:32:08.685 --> 02:32:09.865
So we were able to use those

2580
02:32:09.885 --> 02:32:11.705
to at least give us a ballpark estimate of

2581
02:32:11.705 --> 02:32:12.985
what we expect these to come in.

2582
02:32:13.765 --> 02:32:16.065
Um, and again, what we'll be recommending

2583
02:32:16.065 --> 02:32:18.305
that we use some accumulated interest funds

2584
02:32:18.305 --> 02:32:20.305
that are accumulated in our bond funds to be able

2585
02:32:20.305 --> 02:32:21.585
to support that project.

2586
02:32:22.885 --> 02:32:25.745
We advertised for this project, uh, twice back in October.

2587
02:32:25.885 --> 02:32:28.585
We are doing this as a full blown request for proposals.

2588
02:32:29.045 --> 02:32:31.225
Had a mandatory site walk October 28th.

2589
02:32:31.225 --> 02:32:33.505
We had a half dozen vendors show up for that walk.

2590
02:32:33.685 --> 02:32:34.985
So we're really excited about that.

2591
02:32:35.345 --> 02:32:36.945
'cause of course, the more vendors you have,

2592
02:32:36.945 --> 02:32:38.945
generally the more competitive the pricing is.

2593
02:32:39.725 --> 02:32:42.105
The last day for them to submit questions was last week.

2594
02:32:42.195 --> 02:32:44.665
We're responding to those, um, have responded to those.

2595
02:32:45.365 --> 02:32:47.505
And bids are due at the end of this week.

2596
02:32:48.205 --> 02:32:50.785
Um, our goal is to bring back a contract, as Chris said

2597
02:32:50.785 --> 02:32:52.385
to the board in December.

2598
02:32:52.965 --> 02:32:54.665
Um, one of the open questions for us

2599
02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:56.745
that we'd like feedback from the board on is whether we

2600
02:32:56.745 --> 02:32:57.865
bring that contract back

2601
02:32:57.885 --> 02:33:00.425
as a consent item on the December 3rd agenda, knowing

2602
02:33:00.425 --> 02:33:03.585
that we were intentionally keeping that limited to the, uh,

2603
02:33:03.585 --> 02:33:04.585
first interim report

2604
02:33:04.925 --> 02:33:07.465
or bring that back for a full discussion on December 17th.

2605
02:33:07.565 --> 02:33:09.425
And we'll be looking forward to your feedback on that.

2606
02:33:10.245 --> 02:33:13.465
And we expect to have the project completed within 75 days

2607
02:33:13.605 --> 02:33:16.385
of, um, issuing the notice to proceed, which we will do

2608
02:33:16.385 --> 02:33:18.385
after the board has authorized the, uh,

2609
02:33:18.565 --> 02:33:19.665
the US going forward.

2610
02:33:20.955 --> 02:33:22.445
With that, I'm happy to answer any

2611
02:33:22.605 --> 02:33:23.725
questions the board might have or take.

2612
02:33:23.725 --> 02:33:24.725
Any comments,

2613
02:33:26.535 --> 02:33:28.305
Trustee, chair, and then Trustee Blackman.

2614
02:33:29.235 --> 02:33:33.785
Thank you. So, uh, did this ever come

2615
02:33:33.785 --> 02:33:38.545
before the board as an idea to do, or did we just go out

2616
02:33:38.605 --> 02:33:40.065
and think, this is a good idea,

2617
02:33:40.455 --> 02:33:42.505
This is being done, because staff decided it was

2618
02:33:42.545 --> 02:33:44.065
a worthy thing to be doing.

2619
02:33:44.575 --> 02:33:47.385
Okay. Thank you Trustee

2620
02:33:47.385 --> 02:33:48.385
Blackman.

2621
02:33:48.865 --> 02:33:51.625
I said, uh, thank you for bringing this forward.

2622
02:33:51.945 --> 02:33:54.105
I see it's just an information update for us,

2623
02:33:54.165 --> 02:33:56.025
so we're not be making any decisions,

2624
02:33:56.025 --> 02:33:57.105
we're just providing input.

2625
02:33:57.645 --> 02:33:59.065
The question I had, I understand,

2626
02:33:59.085 --> 02:34:01.745
and I appreciate that you clarified that you did the drawing

2627
02:34:01.985 --> 02:34:03.145
'cause I had lots of questions about it.

2628
02:34:03.765 --> 02:34:06.185
Um, we just put in fencing around Fallon

2629
02:34:06.485 --> 02:34:10.385
and at the comments related to that project, the request was

2630
02:34:10.405 --> 02:34:12.425
to make sure that there were enough egress

2631
02:34:12.425 --> 02:34:14.065
gates at that site.

2632
02:34:14.085 --> 02:34:16.345
And it's very clear that not enough were installed.

2633
02:34:17.065 --> 02:34:19.765
Um, I'm very concerned not being able to see the number

2634
02:34:19.765 --> 02:34:21.325
of gates being proposed

2635
02:34:21.345 --> 02:34:24.885
and the diagram shown that we have learned from that lesson.

2636
02:34:25.635 --> 02:34:28.925
This is a 3000 student school in an emergency.

2637
02:34:28.925 --> 02:34:30.805
When all those students are trying to get out,

2638
02:34:30.915 --> 02:34:33.725
what happens is that they jam up against a gate.

2639
02:34:33.865 --> 02:34:36.205
And we had that happen at Fallon during an event

2640
02:34:36.495 --> 02:34:40.205
where students were all gathered around an ice cream handout

2641
02:34:40.625 --> 02:34:43.005
and they all jammed by the gate and nobody could leave.

2642
02:34:43.545 --> 02:34:45.645
So I'm very concerned when we start

2643
02:34:46.155 --> 02:34:48.965
proposing fencing without actually showing the number

2644
02:34:48.985 --> 02:34:51.205
of egress points that we would have to have.

2645
02:34:51.865 --> 02:34:55.045
And I would not rely on a fencing contractor to tell you.

2646
02:34:55.445 --> 02:34:57.845
I would re rely on somebody who actually deals

2647
02:34:57.875 --> 02:35:00.485
with fire egress, maybe the fire department

2648
02:35:00.485 --> 02:35:01.525
or others to come in

2649
02:35:01.525 --> 02:35:03.365
and provide you with precisely

2650
02:35:03.365 --> 02:35:04.805
where those egress points should be

2651
02:35:04.805 --> 02:35:06.485
and that the panic bars be included.

2652
02:35:06.625 --> 02:35:08.765
So my other concern is that some

2653
02:35:08.765 --> 02:35:11.005
of the diagram shows the fencing right up against the

2654
02:35:11.365 --> 02:35:12.405
sidewalk in a case

2655
02:35:12.485 --> 02:35:14.685
where 3000 students are exiting very quickly

2656
02:35:14.825 --> 02:35:16.765
and there's lots of cars on the road, it's very easy

2657
02:35:16.785 --> 02:35:18.645
for students to come off on the sidewalk

2658
02:35:19.075 --> 02:35:20.285
when the fence has them.

2659
02:35:20.285 --> 02:35:21.645
They're right up against the,

2660
02:35:21.675 --> 02:35:23.405
when the sidewalk isn't large enough

2661
02:35:23.425 --> 02:35:24.725
and the fence is right up against it,

2662
02:35:24.725 --> 02:35:26.365
there's not enough room for that many number of students

2663
02:35:26.365 --> 02:35:28.365
to actually get away from the site.

2664
02:35:28.985 --> 02:35:30.845
So, um, I hope that it's just a diagram

2665
02:35:31.185 --> 02:35:32.845
and that the fence is further inboard

2666
02:35:32.845 --> 02:35:34.085
from the concrete sidewalk.

2667
02:35:34.745 --> 02:35:36.925
My last comment is also, we have problems

2668
02:35:36.955 --> 02:35:39.805
with the securing the fence that was installed at Fallon.

2669
02:35:40.305 --> 02:35:43.125
Um, and I would ask that there be stronger foundation for

2670
02:35:43.125 --> 02:35:45.565
that fence being installed at Dublin High School so

2671
02:35:45.565 --> 02:35:46.565
that we don't have the same problems

2672
02:35:46.565 --> 02:35:48.165
that we have at at Fallon.

2673
02:35:48.175 --> 02:35:49.175
Thank you.

2674
02:35:51.905 --> 02:35:53.985
I just had two minor questions.

2675
02:35:54.245 --> 02:35:57.585
Um, the drawing here stops at the pack

2676
02:35:58.125 --> 02:36:00.465
and I know there's an opening from the pack

2677
02:36:00.485 --> 02:36:02.345
to the ESN classrooms.

2678
02:36:02.345 --> 02:36:03.665
Thank you for calling that out. We actually do

2679
02:36:03.665 --> 02:36:04.745
have one more stretch.

2680
02:36:04.745 --> 02:36:06.705
Okay. On the other side of the pack, closing off

2681
02:36:06.705 --> 02:36:07.985
that driveway that goes

2682
02:36:07.985 --> 02:36:08.985
To the back. Okay. I just wanna make sure.

2683
02:36:08.985 --> 02:36:09.225
Yep.

2684
02:36:09.245 --> 02:36:13.385
And I'm assuming all of the places like that area, um,

2685
02:36:13.535 --> 02:36:17.265
that have kind of those metal removal things would have

2686
02:36:17.915 --> 02:36:19.465
gates that like a firetruck could correct.

2687
02:36:19.605 --> 02:36:21.025
Go through. Um,

2688
02:36:21.085 --> 02:36:22.825
and then my other question was on the,

2689
02:36:22.965 --> 02:36:24.585
the art building I think it is,

2690
02:36:24.885 --> 02:36:28.385
and which is just to the left of the office,

2691
02:36:31.085 --> 02:36:33.375
that one kind of closest to the parking lot.

2692
02:36:34.265 --> 02:36:36.245
Yep. Right, right there. Um,

2693
02:36:38.625 --> 02:36:40.305
I know there's some doors on the outside there,

2694
02:36:40.305 --> 02:36:41.305
but they don't get used.

2695
02:36:41.305 --> 02:36:42.305
They use the courtyard doors,

2696
02:36:42.325 --> 02:36:44.865
but there's also some double doors that don't seem

2697
02:36:44.885 --> 02:36:46.385
to be included.

2698
02:36:46.405 --> 02:36:48.705
So I don't know if those double doors never get used,

2699
02:36:49.685 --> 02:36:50.825
um, or anything.

2700
02:36:51.065 --> 02:36:52.225
I would just check on that.

2701
02:36:52.285 --> 02:36:55.865
But I did a walk this weekend, um, since I walked

2702
02:36:55.865 --> 02:36:57.945
through there a lot and was just noticing there's kind

2703
02:36:57.945 --> 02:37:01.905
of a double door entryway into that building kind

2704
02:37:01.905 --> 02:37:03.305
of in the top left corner.

2705
02:37:04.085 --> 02:37:06.025
Um, that looks like a main entrance.

2706
02:37:07.025 --> 02:37:08.915
That building. Yeah. So we made sure that the fencing is,

2707
02:37:09.825 --> 02:37:11.835
there's access to all of those classrooms

2708
02:37:11.835 --> 02:37:13.115
through the inside of that building.

2709
02:37:13.535 --> 02:37:14.955
And so the outside doors

2710
02:37:14.965 --> 02:37:15.965
Would all be locked outside. So those

2711
02:37:15.965 --> 02:37:17.685
outside doors would, that double doors aren't used

2712
02:37:17.965 --> 02:37:22.075
consistently That there is the inside, like in that corridor

2713
02:37:22.075 --> 02:37:23.155
between the two buildings.

2714
02:37:23.815 --> 02:37:25.645
Right. Okay. So that would be used. Okay.

2715
02:37:25.645 --> 02:37:27.285
That was just my two, my two questions

2716
02:37:28.395 --> 02:37:29.565
walking around this weekend.

2717
02:37:29.675 --> 02:37:33.125
Okay. Trust spec and trusty chair.

2718
02:37:34.435 --> 02:37:37.495
Um, I would need to just know where the exits are.

2719
02:37:37.575 --> 02:37:39.095
I understand this is informational and

2720
02:37:39.155 --> 02:37:41.215
but to vote on it, I would need to understand

2721
02:37:41.215 --> 02:37:44.295
where the different exits are and what kind of exit it is.

2722
02:37:44.295 --> 02:37:47.935
Single push bar, double, I don't know what you call it,

2723
02:37:47.935 --> 02:37:51.815
but the sliding door, garage door thing at Emerald

2724
02:37:51.815 --> 02:37:52.855
that they have at the front.

2725
02:37:53.075 --> 02:37:55.535
So, um, to get an idea of how many,

2726
02:37:55.535 --> 02:37:57.975
because egress is definitely the number one thing I've

2727
02:37:57.975 --> 02:38:00.095
heard, um, as I've talked, um, to folks

2728
02:38:00.155 --> 02:38:03.535
and just understanding what those, um, points are.

2729
02:38:03.875 --> 02:38:05.575
Um, number one

2730
02:38:05.575 --> 02:38:07.575
and absolute most important, um, is so

2731
02:38:07.575 --> 02:38:09.775
that people can get off campus if they need to.

2732
02:38:09.955 --> 02:38:13.575
But also we host a number of events, um, at this school

2733
02:38:14.035 --> 02:38:17.215
and I wanna make sure that, um, we still are able to,

2734
02:38:17.285 --> 02:38:18.815
it's an amazing school to be able to do that.

2735
02:38:18.835 --> 02:38:20.175
And so I wanna make sure we've thought

2736
02:38:20.175 --> 02:38:21.895
through those, um, as well.

2737
02:38:22.235 --> 02:38:26.135
And, um, we'll still be able to have people flowing

2738
02:38:26.135 --> 02:38:28.295
through campus as we need to for these events

2739
02:38:28.295 --> 02:38:30.295
that we will hold, you know, on weekends.

2740
02:38:31.155 --> 02:38:34.535
Um, so yeah, that's the main thing that I, I wanna make sure

2741
02:38:34.535 --> 02:38:36.215
that I would see before I could vote on it.

2742
02:38:42.325 --> 02:38:45.915
Thank you. Um, it looks like we're making comments too.

2743
02:38:46.035 --> 02:38:47.995
I okay. I, that's why I just asked the question.

2744
02:38:47.995 --> 02:38:49.555
Yeah, it's not an action item, so, okay.

2745
02:38:49.695 --> 02:38:52.395
All right. That makes sense. Uh, two things.

2746
02:38:53.975 --> 02:38:55.435
Um, the idea

2747
02:38:55.435 --> 02:38:58.515
of fencing at Dublin High was brought up when the

2748
02:38:58.625 --> 02:39:01.555
modernization happened quite some time ago.

2749
02:39:01.735 --> 02:39:04.355
The, the measure, uh, b modernization.

2750
02:39:05.695 --> 02:39:10.155
And, um, the board said we don't want fencing

2751
02:39:10.615 --> 02:39:11.795
for a lot of reasons.

2752
02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:16.715
One was aesthetics two was, um,

2753
02:39:18.265 --> 02:39:22.355
student mindset, you know, makes it look like it's kind

2754
02:39:22.355 --> 02:39:27.255
of a, a place she get kind of pinned in.

2755
02:39:28.195 --> 02:39:31.055
But the biggest reason, and, uh, Megan Rouse

2756
02:39:31.075 --> 02:39:33.815
and I were both, uh, trustee Megan Rouse

2757
02:39:33.815 --> 02:39:37.815
and I were both big on this, was is, uh,

2758
02:39:38.325 --> 02:39:42.295
student safety is, is, uh, let's say you have a, uh,

2759
02:39:42.685 --> 02:39:44.855
on-campus shooter and you're not gonna keep on campus

2760
02:39:44.855 --> 02:39:47.935
shooter out the, to,

2761
02:39:48.035 --> 02:39:51.495
to me the best thing is let everybody run every direction

2762
02:39:52.155 --> 02:39:53.295
to get away from that

2763
02:39:53.875 --> 02:39:57.135
and not, you know, congregate people at certain areas.

2764
02:39:57.515 --> 02:40:01.215
So, uh, you know, maybe when this,

2765
02:40:01.965 --> 02:40:05.295
this contract comes before us, if they show a lot of plans

2766
02:40:05.435 --> 02:40:07.295
and there's a lot of gates

2767
02:40:08.395 --> 02:40:10.295
and there's not, you know, um,

2768
02:40:11.725 --> 02:40:16.205
there's not choke points where it's easy to to,

2769
02:40:16.425 --> 02:40:19.245
to cause uh, damage

2770
02:40:19.345 --> 02:40:21.205
and that's what's happened in some other high schools.

2771
02:40:21.625 --> 02:40:26.045
Um, I, I would definitely be voting against the contract,

2772
02:40:26.065 --> 02:40:28.045
not for who the contractor is of the price or anything,

2773
02:40:28.105 --> 02:40:31.525
but just because of philosophical reason

2774
02:40:31.565 --> 02:40:33.325
that I don't believe this is in the

2775
02:40:33.325 --> 02:40:34.765
best interest of student safety.

2776
02:40:35.995 --> 02:40:40.565
That all aside, if we do end up with this on the very bottom

2777
02:40:40.665 --> 02:40:42.445
of this, uh, where it says Google,

2778
02:40:42.675 --> 02:40:44.205
there's a crosswalk right there,

2779
02:40:44.225 --> 02:40:46.205
and a lot of students enter right there.

2780
02:40:46.225 --> 02:40:49.605
Do you know if there's an in ingress gate right there?

2781
02:40:56.235 --> 02:40:57.295
And I just turned it off so

2782
02:40:57.295 --> 02:40:58.375
I couldn't, so you couldn't hear me.

2783
02:40:58.635 --> 02:40:59.815
So yeah, long Brighton, there,

2784
02:40:59.815 --> 02:41:01.215
there are ingress gates there.

2785
02:41:01.285 --> 02:41:06.235
Yeah. Well, we're kind of in the middle between the, the,

2786
02:41:06.435 --> 02:41:08.635
I don't know what the letters are anymore, I forget,

2787
02:41:08.735 --> 02:41:09.755
but there's a,

2788
02:41:09.815 --> 02:41:12.195
you can see a crosswalk coming just to the left of

2789
02:41:12.335 --> 02:41:13.235
The sheet, kinda of the, where the bike

2790
02:41:13.355 --> 02:41:14.395
racks are right now. Yep.

2791
02:41:14.825 --> 02:41:19.395
Okay. And that would be open, uh, that would be open

2792
02:41:19.575 --> 02:41:21.675
for students to, to come in and Right.

2793
02:41:21.735 --> 02:41:24.555
I'm gonna, it's okay. Invite principal.

2794
02:41:24.555 --> 02:41:25.915
Uh, and that would have to be open all

2795
02:41:25.915 --> 02:41:27.915
through a period and that kind of stuff. So

2796
02:41:28.735 --> 02:41:30.995
By principal burn up here, who was part of the walkthrough

2797
02:41:31.015 --> 02:41:33.155
and knows those gates better than I do.

2798
02:41:33.215 --> 02:41:34.215
Oh,

2799
02:41:36.865 --> 02:41:37.865
Ron, you could help me too.

2800
02:41:38.045 --> 02:41:40.085
'cause he was part of the, the walk as well.

2801
02:41:40.425 --> 02:41:43.565
So you're talking the, what we call the Brighton gap, right?

2802
02:41:43.585 --> 02:41:47.165
Yes. Okay. So I believe I'm, Ron, correct me if I'm wrong,

2803
02:41:47.375 --> 02:41:49.885
there was gonna be a double wide gate there so

2804
02:41:50.085 --> 02:41:51.605
that way trucks could get in

2805
02:41:52.105 --> 02:41:55.405
and we have, um, ability for students to get out

2806
02:41:56.965 --> 02:41:58.825
And come in in the morning And come in in the morning.

2807
02:41:58.885 --> 02:42:01.865
Yes. Okay. And another double wide, near the parking lot.

2808
02:42:02.135 --> 02:42:04.745
Okay. Well, as a minimum I think we should do that

2809
02:42:05.055 --> 02:42:07.745
because that's a big entry point for students.

2810
02:42:08.705 --> 02:42:10.105
I don't know how you do it

2811
02:42:10.105 --> 02:42:13.385
with some students starting a period, uh, zero period,

2812
02:42:13.455 --> 02:42:14.745
some periods starting one.

2813
02:42:15.245 --> 02:42:19.665
Do you reopen it? I mean, it's, it seems to have issues and,

2814
02:42:20.245 --> 02:42:21.585
and you know, there are a lot of 'em are leaving

2815
02:42:21.585 --> 02:42:23.225
after sixth period or whatever.

2816
02:42:23.255 --> 02:42:26.665
It's just, it, it just, uh, I don't see this working.

2817
02:42:27.705 --> 02:42:31.585
I think it's just a way for the like, um, someone

2818
02:42:31.615 --> 02:42:33.225
with ill intent to get in

2819
02:42:33.845 --> 02:42:35.825
and then it's trapping the students that are there.

2820
02:42:36.065 --> 02:42:40.905
I really think this is a bad idea, but my personal opinion,

2821
02:42:41.005 --> 02:42:42.825
and it was also Trustee Rouse's opinion

2822
02:42:43.165 --> 02:42:44.585
for whatever that means. And

2823
02:42:44.585 --> 02:42:46.065
I'll speak to that in public comment,

2824
02:42:48.045 --> 02:42:50.105
Uh, trustee Blackman and then Trustee Wanni.

2825
02:42:50.885 --> 02:42:53.425
So, uh, I'm glad Trustee Chair brought that up.

2826
02:42:53.665 --> 02:42:54.665
I know this is just a diagram,

2827
02:42:55.445 --> 02:42:57.825
but in a, I was part of a study

2828
02:42:57.825 --> 02:42:59.865
that happened in a New York City school with thousands

2829
02:42:59.865 --> 02:43:02.345
of students getting outta a gym and in a panic stone

2830
02:43:02.345 --> 02:43:03.585
and don't follow direction.

2831
02:43:03.585 --> 02:43:05.105
They don't think straight. You might say,

2832
02:43:05.105 --> 02:43:06.265
go down this Hal to the exit.

2833
02:43:06.265 --> 02:43:08.425
Don't go down that way. Students just go anyway.

2834
02:43:08.425 --> 02:43:11.065
It's like water. And you really can't predict,

2835
02:43:11.255 --> 02:43:12.525
which is why it's really important

2836
02:43:12.525 --> 02:43:15.165
that you have exit gates all over the place.

2837
02:43:15.485 --> 02:43:16.685
'cause wherever they are, that's

2838
02:43:16.685 --> 02:43:17.885
where they're going to need to get out.

2839
02:43:18.585 --> 02:43:19.925
My concern that I brought up

2840
02:43:19.925 --> 02:43:22.765
before about Fallon is that we asked for a double gate so

2841
02:43:22.765 --> 02:43:25.125
that large groups of people when they're two shoulder

2842
02:43:25.125 --> 02:43:27.965
or three feet apart, could actually get through on mass.

2843
02:43:28.435 --> 02:43:30.805
What was installed is a single gate panic,

2844
02:43:31.025 --> 02:43:32.885
but a large gate for a truck to go through.

2845
02:43:32.985 --> 02:43:34.925
You're not gonna have time to go out there

2846
02:43:34.945 --> 02:43:37.045
and unlock a gate when there's thousands

2847
02:43:37.045 --> 02:43:38.045
of students coming at you.

2848
02:43:38.665 --> 02:43:39.805
So it's really important

2849
02:43:39.805 --> 02:43:42.165
that if you're gonna do these long expanses of gates,

2850
02:43:42.165 --> 02:43:45.685
that you have exit doors with panic bar hardware all along

2851
02:43:46.065 --> 02:43:48.005
so that wherever the student ends up against

2852
02:43:48.125 --> 02:43:49.405
that wall, they can get out.

2853
02:43:49.785 --> 02:43:51.885
As Trustee Cherry was saying, it's difficult to,

2854
02:43:51.945 --> 02:43:53.125
you don't wanna trap anybody.

2855
02:43:53.945 --> 02:43:55.685
My other comment about the sidewalks is

2856
02:43:55.685 --> 02:43:57.565
that this campus was never designed, presuming

2857
02:43:57.565 --> 02:43:59.485
that there were gonna be gates all up against

2858
02:43:59.545 --> 02:44:00.565
all these buildings.

2859
02:44:00.625 --> 02:44:02.445
And these sidewalks, if you notice,

2860
02:44:02.455 --> 02:44:05.285
especially the student parking lot near the gym,

2861
02:44:05.715 --> 02:44:07.125
this is heavily used by students.

2862
02:44:07.155 --> 02:44:09.205
It's just easy to get to. They really like the parking lot.

2863
02:44:09.205 --> 02:44:11.285
They go to sports in the afternoon, they wanna park there.

2864
02:44:11.285 --> 02:44:13.925
It's really easy. But the number of students that come off

2865
02:44:13.925 --> 02:44:16.325
of campus moving from the west to the east into

2866
02:44:16.325 --> 02:44:17.925
that parking lot is huge.

2867
02:44:18.785 --> 02:44:21.405
So my concern is that if you're gonna put fencing there,

2868
02:44:21.405 --> 02:44:22.525
it means you're directing students

2869
02:44:22.525 --> 02:44:24.085
to certain locations to get out.

2870
02:44:24.145 --> 02:44:27.405
We don't actually have a lot of sidewalk depth there

2871
02:44:27.785 --> 02:44:29.805
to divide the sidewalk between a fence,

2872
02:44:30.155 --> 02:44:31.485
whether you're on one side

2873
02:44:31.485 --> 02:44:32.685
of the fence or you're on the other.

2874
02:44:32.905 --> 02:44:34.165
So I would ask, I know

2875
02:44:34.165 --> 02:44:35.925
that we're looking at putting something up to deal

2876
02:44:35.925 --> 02:44:38.125
with this right away, but I'm also concerned

2877
02:44:38.125 --> 02:44:40.085
that some point we're gonna sit there and go grimace

2878
02:44:40.085 --> 02:44:42.005
and wish we had put in maybe a little bit more thought

2879
02:44:42.005 --> 02:44:45.485
to crane wider sidewalks so that students wouldn't be forced

2880
02:44:45.485 --> 02:44:47.925
between a fence and a curb and an oncoming vehicle.

2881
02:44:48.665 --> 02:44:51.125
My fear right now in all this not seeing the detail is

2882
02:44:51.125 --> 02:44:53.565
again, some students could be walking on one side of

2883
02:44:53.565 --> 02:44:55.165
that fence and there won't be enough sidewalk

2884
02:44:55.265 --> 02:44:57.765
to protect them from being pushed into the oncoming traffic.

2885
02:44:58.115 --> 02:45:00.565
Granted, I hope they drive slowly, but you never know.

2886
02:45:00.665 --> 02:45:03.125
So anyways, I wish this would come back to us

2887
02:45:03.125 --> 02:45:05.405
with a little bit more detail before we like, bless it.

2888
02:45:05.405 --> 02:45:06.405
Thank you.

2889
02:45:07.795 --> 02:45:10.925
Yeah, I definitely understand all the concerns about

2890
02:45:10.985 --> 02:45:15.205
the entrances and exits and clustering, um, initially also,

2891
02:45:15.205 --> 02:45:17.685
because like, we can't see it on the diagram, but initially

2892
02:45:17.685 --> 02:45:20.885
before going to the walkthrough, I expect I did not expect

2893
02:45:20.945 --> 02:45:23.165
as many gates as they were talking about.

2894
02:45:23.165 --> 02:45:24.245
Like there were so many,

2895
02:45:24.705 --> 02:45:27.725
and I honestly, I visited the Fallon campus, of course,

2896
02:45:27.945 --> 02:45:29.045
and with the gates too.

2897
02:45:29.225 --> 02:45:33.205
And compared to that, I think there's many, many more gates.

2898
02:45:33.705 --> 02:45:36.645
So I think once we see it again, it might clarify a lot

2899
02:45:36.645 --> 02:45:38.165
of the concerns that are coming up right now.

2900
02:45:39.765 --> 02:45:40.975
Yeah. And also to clarify,

2901
02:45:40.985 --> 02:45:44.375
there are generally cars parked all along Brighton.

2902
02:45:44.375 --> 02:45:48.465
There, there's, there's a layer of, of parked cars always.

2903
02:45:50.165 --> 02:45:52.635
Um, so, um, I know this,

2904
02:45:52.875 --> 02:45:55.335
I think there probably will be more questions, um,

2905
02:45:55.725 --> 02:45:57.775
when the official RFP comes forward.

2906
02:45:58.235 --> 02:46:00.495
Um, um, and I believe un

2907
02:46:00.495 --> 02:46:02.615
unless I hear direction from the rest of the board

2908
02:46:02.645 --> 02:46:05.105
that the meeting on the third

2909
02:46:05.165 --> 02:46:07.705
or whatever is, is just that budget meeting.

2910
02:46:07.845 --> 02:46:12.515
So I'm assuming they would not want to bring this forward.

2911
02:46:13.995 --> 02:46:18.095
So the, the, the, the question on the third is, um,

2912
02:46:18.355 --> 02:46:19.775
we definitely, the motion was

2913
02:46:19.795 --> 02:46:22.175
to approve one operational agenda item,

2914
02:46:22.235 --> 02:46:23.575
and that was the first interim.

2915
02:46:24.315 --> 02:46:28.215
Uh, but usually you always have a consent calendar

2916
02:46:28.245 --> 02:46:31.375
that follows, um, even on special board meetings.

2917
02:46:31.375 --> 02:46:34.295
So is is it the board's recollection

2918
02:46:34.295 --> 02:46:36.455
that there would not even be a consent? Um,

2919
02:46:36.455 --> 02:46:37.855
Yeah, that was the motion that was approved.

2920
02:46:37.955 --> 02:46:40.655
It would be just the only one item.

2921
02:46:40.885 --> 02:46:42.855
Okay. So we'll bring it back on the 17th then.

2922
02:46:43.495 --> 02:46:46.935
I mean, we can change that by a consent on the board.

2923
02:46:47.225 --> 02:46:51.285
Right. But, uh, that's what was approved,

2924
02:46:52.575 --> 02:46:53.575
Right? No, I, I

2925
02:46:53.575 --> 02:46:54.845
I definitely know it was one item,

2926
02:46:54.945 --> 02:46:57.565
but usually when we talk about a a item,

2927
02:46:57.745 --> 02:47:00.525
we talk about operational, so not a problem.

2928
02:47:00.525 --> 02:47:01.765
We'll bring it back on the 17th

2929
02:47:01.765 --> 02:47:03.205
unless, uh, I hear different.

2930
02:47:06.475 --> 02:47:08.445
Okay. It is eight 17.

2931
02:47:09.045 --> 02:47:10.565
I think we're gonna need to take a quick break

2932
02:47:10.665 --> 02:47:12.565
before we head into data walk. President

2933
02:47:12.685 --> 02:47:13.285
Pellum. Oh,

2934
02:47:14.285 --> 02:47:15.615
Apologize for interrupting.

2935
02:47:15.615 --> 02:47:16.775
That's okay. Do you think there

2936
02:47:16.775 --> 02:47:17.855
was public comment on this item?

2937
02:47:18.115 --> 02:47:20.225
Oh, Oh, sorry.

2938
02:47:23.185 --> 02:47:24.575
Sorry. You wanna? Yes.

2939
02:47:24.595 --> 02:47:26.895
We have one person seeking to make public comment

2940
02:47:26.995 --> 02:47:28.175
and that is Maureen Byrne.

2941
02:47:32.165 --> 02:47:35.585
Hi again. Uh, I would like to thank you

2942
02:47:35.585 --> 02:47:37.385
for your consideration for this fence.

2943
02:47:37.895 --> 02:47:40.505
This conversation is really a long time coming.

2944
02:47:41.145 --> 02:47:44.465
I can remember as well as, um, board member chair,

2945
02:47:44.965 --> 02:47:48.145
the conversations when we first were rebuilding the campus

2946
02:47:48.805 --> 02:47:50.545
At that time, there was a lot of pushback,

2947
02:47:50.545 --> 02:47:51.865
and I was one of them as well.

2948
02:47:52.405 --> 02:47:54.985
Our campus was a very welcoming community

2949
02:47:55.005 --> 02:47:56.865
and it looked like a community college,

2950
02:47:57.405 --> 02:48:00.945
and the open field was part of that feel through the years.

2951
02:48:00.945 --> 02:48:02.505
So the conversation has changed.

2952
02:48:03.235 --> 02:48:06.105
About 10 years ago, I was walking a first responder

2953
02:48:06.105 --> 02:48:07.905
to a class in our science building

2954
02:48:07.905 --> 02:48:09.105
where they were a guest speaker.

2955
02:48:09.965 --> 02:48:11.505
She looked at me and said, wow,

2956
02:48:11.505 --> 02:48:12.825
this is really an open campus.

2957
02:48:13.465 --> 02:48:15.465
I thought it was a compliment until she

2958
02:48:15.975 --> 02:48:17.625
explained her safety concerns.

2959
02:48:18.035 --> 02:48:20.665
Since then, I've heard from multiple law enforcement

2960
02:48:20.745 --> 02:48:23.505
officers about those similar concerns.

2961
02:48:24.205 --> 02:48:26.105
And through the years, our country has changed

2962
02:48:26.205 --> 02:48:29.265
and our, our need for the fence has has also,

2963
02:48:29.795 --> 02:48:31.025
after Parkland, many

2964
02:48:31.025 --> 02:48:33.625
of our teachers downstairs in the buildings adjacent

2965
02:48:33.725 --> 02:48:36.145
to the bright to Brighton Express concerns

2966
02:48:36.375 --> 02:48:38.825
that anyone could walk in on the street easily.

2967
02:48:39.285 --> 02:48:42.065
And we have had that, we're a safe community

2968
02:48:42.085 --> 02:48:44.105
and we haven't had major problems,

2969
02:48:44.105 --> 02:48:47.345
but we have had parents coming in to check on the grades

2970
02:48:47.485 --> 02:48:48.945
for a teacher or check in with them.

2971
02:48:48.945 --> 02:48:52.545
And some have been aggressive admin had no idea about these

2972
02:48:52.675 --> 02:48:54.025
until after it happened.

2973
02:48:54.045 --> 02:48:57.065
So had no ability to help our teachers.

2974
02:48:58.355 --> 02:49:01.705
Since I became principal at nine years ago, I've lobbied

2975
02:49:01.705 --> 02:49:03.185
with every single superintendent,

2976
02:49:03.485 --> 02:49:06.065
and I wanna say I'm very grateful to Superintendent Funk

2977
02:49:06.085 --> 02:49:07.105
for bringing this forward.

2978
02:49:08.155 --> 02:49:12.445
This past week, I su surveyed the DHS staff, excuse me,

2979
02:49:12.925 --> 02:49:15.325
159 staff member responded.

2980
02:49:15.785 --> 02:49:17.445
Of those 112

2981
02:49:17.585 --> 02:49:22.045
or 70.4% responded, yes, 21%,

2982
02:49:22.845 --> 02:49:27.365
13, 30, 21 staff, 13.2% were on the fence.

2983
02:49:27.945 --> 02:49:29.085
Yes, the pun was intended.

2984
02:49:29.225 --> 02:49:31.525
And this was a choice they had those

2985
02:49:31.525 --> 02:49:34.085
who marked this choice were concerned about accessibility

2986
02:49:34.185 --> 02:49:37.005
to campus, the placement of the fence and aesthetics.

2987
02:49:37.625 --> 02:49:42.365
We had 26 members of staff, 16.4% say no.

2988
02:49:42.815 --> 02:49:45.485
Their rationale range from the aesthetic concerns

2989
02:49:45.505 --> 02:49:48.045
to remarking that this would not be a deterrent if someone

2990
02:49:48.045 --> 02:49:49.405
really wanted to do something.

2991
02:49:49.755 --> 02:49:52.005
Unfortunately, I think we all understand that,

2992
02:49:52.005 --> 02:49:53.005
that indeed is true.

2993
02:49:54.145 --> 02:49:56.845
Dublin High School is the only STU school in the district

2994
02:49:56.845 --> 02:49:59.285
and the only high school in the county without offense.

2995
02:49:59.775 --> 02:50:01.725
While we know it's not a panacea

2996
02:50:01.725 --> 02:50:04.485
that will prevent anything bad from happening,

2997
02:50:04.945 --> 02:50:07.645
it does provide both a deterrent and a delay.

2998
02:50:08.145 --> 02:50:10.645
If we have the opportunity to provide our students

2999
02:50:10.745 --> 02:50:13.365
and staff that we have an obligation to do so,

3000
02:50:14.065 --> 02:50:15.485
we have a beautiful campus

3001
02:50:15.545 --> 02:50:18.005
and recognize that the importance of having a fence

3002
02:50:18.005 --> 02:50:21.885
that enhances, not detracts from that we want our GAILs

3003
02:50:21.885 --> 02:50:25.245
to thrive at school, at a school that is not only beautiful,

3004
02:50:25.545 --> 02:50:27.725
but has an increased measure of safety.

3005
02:50:28.405 --> 02:50:29.485
I ask that when it comes

3006
02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:31.445
before you in December, you approve it.

3007
02:50:31.535 --> 02:50:32.535
Thank you.

3008
02:50:35.565 --> 02:50:38.385
We have one additional comment and that is Dean McKen.

3009
02:50:43.915 --> 02:50:47.025
Hello everyone. Goodnight. Um, I mean, good evening.

3010
02:50:47.785 --> 02:50:49.145
I wanna go to bed. Um,

3011
02:50:50.415 --> 02:50:52.015
I wanna thank you all for this proposal.

3012
02:50:52.235 --> 02:50:53.975
Um, this is one of the things that I,

3013
02:50:54.215 --> 02:50:56.295
I worked at Wells Middle School

3014
02:50:56.755 --> 02:50:58.855
and we fought for a long time to get more safety

3015
02:50:59.035 --> 02:51:00.335
and fencing around that school.

3016
02:51:00.795 --> 02:51:02.575
Um, moving over to Fallon

3017
02:51:02.955 --> 02:51:05.455
and being part of that process as well, um,

3018
02:51:05.515 --> 02:51:08.775
of getting the fencing, um, installed at that school.

3019
02:51:09.315 --> 02:51:10.455
And at that time,

3020
02:51:11.015 --> 02:51:12.975
I was a little concerned about the aesthetics of

3021
02:51:12.975 --> 02:51:15.255
what it would look like, how it would feel, um,

3022
02:51:15.315 --> 02:51:18.215
if our students would feel like they were being fenced in

3023
02:51:18.435 --> 02:51:21.975
and, um, being secluded or if they felt actually safe.

3024
02:51:22.035 --> 02:51:24.055
And more a sense of belonging on the campus.

3025
02:51:24.715 --> 02:51:25.735
Um, working as a teacher

3026
02:51:25.755 --> 02:51:27.615
and being a, being on different equity teams

3027
02:51:27.615 --> 02:51:29.575
and PBIS as we survey our students,

3028
02:51:29.675 --> 02:51:31.535
one thing we do ask them is about safety.

3029
02:51:32.115 --> 02:51:34.775
And an overwhelming majority of students have said

3030
02:51:34.775 --> 02:51:37.375
that they feel safer with the fencing around the campus.

3031
02:51:38.115 --> 02:51:42.495
Um, so just the, the, um, physical fence

3032
02:51:42.515 --> 02:51:45.375
of it does create a sense of safety for our students.

3033
02:51:45.795 --> 02:51:47.175
Um, we've also had writing prompts

3034
02:51:47.175 --> 02:51:48.375
that we've given the students to,

3035
02:51:48.375 --> 02:51:50.295
and just ask them a blanket statement of

3036
02:51:50.295 --> 02:51:52.095
what makes you feel safe here at Fallon.

3037
02:51:52.555 --> 02:51:54.095
And a lot of the students have said

3038
02:51:54.095 --> 02:51:56.095
that the fence makes them feel safe at Fallon.

3039
02:51:56.355 --> 02:51:58.975
Um, students are well versed in what's going on in social

3040
02:51:58.975 --> 02:52:00.935
media, what's going on in the climate in our world,

3041
02:52:01.235 --> 02:52:05.095
and they feel it more than maybe they're sharing about

3042
02:52:05.205 --> 02:52:07.245
needing to feel safe on our campuses.

3043
02:52:07.745 --> 02:52:10.205
Um, as a parent at Fallon

3044
02:52:10.205 --> 02:52:12.645
and Dublin High, um, one of the talks I did have

3045
02:52:12.645 --> 02:52:14.045
with Superintendent Funk was

3046
02:52:14.585 --> 02:52:17.045
why Dublin High did not have a fence, um,

3047
02:52:17.045 --> 02:52:19.085
after we installed at Fallon Middle School,

3048
02:52:19.315 --> 02:52:23.525
because I felt like it did show, um, that there was a lack

3049
02:52:23.525 --> 02:52:26.045
of care and concern for our high school students,

3050
02:52:26.145 --> 02:52:27.245
but we had care for all

3051
02:52:27.245 --> 02:52:28.445
of the other schools in the district.

3052
02:52:28.825 --> 02:52:31.045
So this is something that I do feel sends a message

3053
02:52:31.145 --> 02:52:32.725
to our students that we care about them,

3054
02:52:32.995 --> 02:52:34.205
that we want them safe.

3055
02:52:34.745 --> 02:52:38.565
And, um, yeah, that, like we said, it's not gonna prevent,

3056
02:52:39.105 --> 02:52:41.445
you know, something from happening from somebody who wants

3057
02:52:41.445 --> 02:52:43.765
to, but it's that extra sense of security

3058
02:52:43.765 --> 02:52:46.805
and safety in our minds that our, our babies are protected

3059
02:52:47.065 --> 02:52:50.445
and that when they, my son is on campus four nights a week,

3060
02:52:50.575 --> 02:52:53.005
practicing it on the weekends, that there's safety there

3061
02:52:53.025 --> 02:52:54.765
for him, people coming in from the trails.

3062
02:52:55.185 --> 02:52:57.285
Um, and that, yeah, just, I,

3063
02:52:57.325 --> 02:52:58.925
I really appreciate you bringing this to the board

3064
02:52:58.925 --> 02:53:00.765
and that our board considers this,

3065
02:53:00.865 --> 02:53:03.085
and I appreciate all of the safety concerns as well.

3066
02:53:03.465 --> 02:53:05.165
Um, but that's why we have drills

3067
02:53:05.185 --> 02:53:07.525
and we make sure that we instruct our students.

3068
02:53:07.985 --> 02:53:10.365
Um, also, I understand the fencing line,

3069
02:53:10.365 --> 02:53:12.325
but if students are getting out of the campus,

3070
02:53:12.325 --> 02:53:13.605
they're gonna run in the street regardless.

3071
02:53:13.785 --> 02:53:16.925
So, um, better we have something that with multiple gates

3072
02:53:16.925 --> 02:53:19.045
that is gonna allow them to get out safety and stop

3073
02:53:19.125 --> 02:53:20.525
or safely and stop themselves

3074
02:53:20.525 --> 02:53:22.085
before they run out into the street.

3075
02:53:22.295 --> 02:53:23.295
Thank you.

3076
02:53:24.305 --> 02:53:26.965
All right. Thank you. Um, Tracy Blackman,

3077
02:53:26.965 --> 02:53:28.765
and then I, do you wanna move on so we can get,

3078
02:53:29.245 --> 02:53:31.045
I do have one question about lunchtime.

3079
02:53:31.705 --> 02:53:33.925
Um, we allow our students to leave the campus

3080
02:53:33.925 --> 02:53:36.325
during lunchtime and is that now going

3081
02:53:36.325 --> 02:53:39.405
to be controlled at certain points of the fence?

3082
02:53:40.155 --> 02:53:42.965
Because I think they all kind of run to get out

3083
02:53:42.985 --> 02:53:45.205
and grab their cars and go. So

3084
02:53:45.235 --> 02:53:46.405
Yeah, well, they don't need to run

3085
02:53:46.565 --> 02:53:49.485
'cause they have 360 area to leave.

3086
02:53:49.625 --> 02:53:52.565
Um, yes, it would be definitely part of the conversation in

3087
02:53:53.225 --> 02:53:54.565
or to let students out

3088
02:53:54.665 --> 02:53:57.445
and making sure that if we do allow it,

3089
02:53:57.465 --> 02:53:58.485
it might be also a time

3090
02:53:58.485 --> 02:54:00.165
to revisit whether we're gonna be an open

3091
02:54:00.165 --> 02:54:01.365
campus or closed campus.

3092
02:54:01.825 --> 02:54:04.005
But those are all kind of future ideas.

3093
02:54:05.935 --> 02:54:07.955
All right. Thank you. I know I won't be

3094
02:54:07.955 --> 02:54:09.155
around on this vote, but I I,

3095
02:54:09.435 --> 02:54:11.475
I do think it unfortunately that it's time has come.

3096
02:54:11.595 --> 02:54:14.515
I think, you know, most any other high school you're

3097
02:54:14.515 --> 02:54:15.555
on is going to have that.

3098
02:54:15.695 --> 02:54:17.475
Um, I, I do love the aesthetics.

3099
02:54:17.475 --> 02:54:19.595
I love, love my walks through there,

3100
02:54:19.695 --> 02:54:22.155
but I do think that the time has come, unfortunately, um,

3101
02:54:22.155 --> 02:54:23.635
given this day and age.

3102
02:54:24.215 --> 02:54:26.315
All right, so it is 8 25.

3103
02:54:26.655 --> 02:54:29.035
I'm gonna give us about, it's five minutes enough

3104
02:54:29.035 --> 02:54:31.995
for everybody, so we can go at eight 30 to restart, um,

3105
02:54:32.215 --> 02:54:33.995
and to do data walk at that point in time.

3106
03:00:55.545 --> 03:00:59.005
All righty. We are back. I see Dr. Campbell

3107
03:00:59.005 --> 03:01:00.285
Campbell coming up to the podium

3108
03:01:01.065 --> 03:01:04.525
to lead the amazing ed services team through the data walk.

3109
03:01:06.275 --> 03:01:08.285
Well, thank you, uh, president Pellum,

3110
03:01:08.305 --> 03:01:10.605
superintendent funk, members of the board,

3111
03:01:10.705 --> 03:01:12.565
and, uh, members of the community

3112
03:01:12.565 --> 03:01:14.165
that are either in person or online.

3113
03:01:14.465 --> 03:01:16.485
Um, I appreciate you saying about the,

3114
03:01:16.705 --> 03:01:18.165
the amazing ed services team,

3115
03:01:18.165 --> 03:01:22.045
and I appreciate Karen's comments about the PD earlier today

3116
03:01:22.515 --> 03:01:26.445
because, um, I am flanked and I sit in front

3117
03:01:26.705 --> 03:01:29.205
or standing in front of an incredible team.

3118
03:01:29.505 --> 03:01:32.445
Um, but this is about the annual data walk.

3119
03:01:33.625 --> 03:01:38.445
Uh, we, we reflect on past data walks

3120
03:01:38.665 --> 03:01:41.485
and our intent is to bring it to you in a way

3121
03:01:41.715 --> 03:01:44.645
that you can digest it then,

3122
03:01:44.665 --> 03:01:45.925
and yet at the same time be present.

3123
03:01:46.785 --> 03:01:50.685
So we changed directions last year from the actual walking

3124
03:01:50.685 --> 03:01:52.245
around to the different stations.

3125
03:01:52.545 --> 03:01:56.205
And what you're gonna see today is gonna have a similar feel

3126
03:01:56.305 --> 03:01:59.845
to, to yesterday, or I'm sorry, to to last year.

3127
03:02:00.745 --> 03:02:02.565
Um, I, before I begin

3128
03:02:02.565 --> 03:02:05.125
and just kind of talk about what our process is gonna be,

3129
03:02:05.325 --> 03:02:10.085
I appreciate working in a district that uses data

3130
03:02:10.505 --> 03:02:15.245
as a ways, as a reflection tool, as a way

3131
03:02:15.245 --> 03:02:19.845
that we can look at our practice to improve how we can, um,

3132
03:02:20.185 --> 03:02:22.485
in essence engage with our community

3133
03:02:22.585 --> 03:02:23.925
and do whatever we can do

3134
03:02:24.025 --> 03:02:25.925
to help our students be successful.

3135
03:02:26.345 --> 03:02:30.325
So I appreciate the time that, that the board has given us

3136
03:02:30.865 --> 03:02:33.925
so that we can present out on our data

3137
03:02:34.185 --> 03:02:36.205
and then hear from you your thoughts

3138
03:02:36.205 --> 03:02:37.685
and reflections and then move forward.

3139
03:02:38.505 --> 03:02:41.605
So the, the data walk that you're gonna see today

3140
03:02:42.845 --> 03:02:45.485
reflects our LCAP that we just finished.

3141
03:02:45.905 --> 03:02:48.285
So the data that is, so it's, you know,

3142
03:02:48.285 --> 03:02:51.845
we're roughly six months behind, um,

3143
03:02:52.525 --> 03:02:54.845
whenever, uh, the data that you're gonna see.

3144
03:02:54.945 --> 03:02:58.005
So the LCAP that we just finished, finished in June,

3145
03:02:58.505 --> 03:03:01.605
but the most, the data is just released from the state.

3146
03:03:02.065 --> 03:03:05.285
So this data reflects our past lcap

3147
03:03:05.905 --> 03:03:07.765
and we thought that it was appropriate

3148
03:03:07.765 --> 03:03:10.445
that we finish out the LCAP with this,

3149
03:03:10.555 --> 03:03:11.805
with the most current data.

3150
03:03:13.355 --> 03:03:16.285
What you see behind me is, as I've already mentioned,

3151
03:03:16.285 --> 03:03:17.525
is the ed services team.

3152
03:03:18.075 --> 03:03:19.845
Last year I gave the whole presentation.

3153
03:03:19.845 --> 03:03:21.605
It was Melissa and I, we gave the whole presentation

3154
03:03:21.745 --> 03:03:24.445
and then we paused and then, um, um, and,

3155
03:03:24.505 --> 03:03:26.765
and the directors were here to answer questions,

3156
03:03:27.355 --> 03:03:29.565
felt like it was gonna be a little bit different.

3157
03:03:29.605 --> 03:03:31.245
I wanted it to be do it differently this year.

3158
03:03:31.865 --> 03:03:34.525
Um, these educators behind me are incredible.

3159
03:03:34.595 --> 03:03:36.685
They're hardworking, earnest, and dedicated,

3160
03:03:37.305 --> 03:03:39.965
and I want them to be on display

3161
03:03:39.965 --> 03:03:42.965
because they know the data, they're the experts in it,

3162
03:03:43.025 --> 03:03:45.005
and in essence, the they are going

3163
03:03:45.005 --> 03:03:48.085
to be presenting on the data and

3164
03:03:48.085 --> 03:03:50.405
or the departments that, that they, that they lead.

3165
03:03:51.425 --> 03:03:53.685
Um, so goal number one, uh, Curtis

3166
03:03:53.785 --> 03:03:58.005
and Sherry are going to co-present, uh, goal number one, uh,

3167
03:03:58.345 --> 03:04:00.685
uh, bill is going to present on goal number two.

3168
03:04:01.455 --> 03:04:04.645
Marco Taylor is going to present on goal number three.

3169
03:04:04.665 --> 03:04:08.045
And then Melissa is going to present on goal number five.

3170
03:04:08.875 --> 03:04:09.925
What we did last year,

3171
03:04:09.985 --> 03:04:12.405
and we're gonna incorporate this year, is that there's a lot

3172
03:04:12.405 --> 03:04:14.245
of data after each goal.

3173
03:04:14.345 --> 03:04:15.925
So we are going to pause

3174
03:04:17.275 --> 03:04:20.665
after we complete the presentation after each goal,

3175
03:04:21.045 --> 03:04:23.305
and then, then the director will be up here

3176
03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:26.065
and they will, um, then take, take the questions.

3177
03:04:26.925 --> 03:04:29.865
Um, my last, my, my last comment is this, it is,

3178
03:04:30.795 --> 03:04:32.445
this work is the result of many people.

3179
03:04:32.755 --> 03:04:34.565
It's, it's the result of, uh,

3180
03:04:34.725 --> 03:04:36.885
superintendent funks leadership, and then,

3181
03:04:36.905 --> 03:04:37.965
and then it filters down.

3182
03:04:37.985 --> 03:04:40.245
And so, yes, I've, I've highlighted the,

3183
03:04:40.305 --> 03:04:41.885
the directors behind me.

3184
03:04:42.075 --> 03:04:45.005
However, it was great to see Maureen Burn here.

3185
03:04:45.005 --> 03:04:46.245
I dunno if she's still here, she's not here.

3186
03:04:46.625 --> 03:04:50.045
Um, but just the, the site admin, their incredible work and,

3187
03:04:50.045 --> 03:04:52.405
and dedication, and then also the teachers

3188
03:04:52.825 --> 03:04:55.165
and the counselors that, that make this work happen.

3189
03:04:55.305 --> 03:04:57.965
So even though we are here presenting the data,

3190
03:04:58.105 --> 03:05:01.045
we are representing the entire district and,

3191
03:05:01.065 --> 03:05:04.605
and the hard work, uh, I'm gonna start with this, this,

3192
03:05:04.665 --> 03:05:05.885
uh, the demographics.

3193
03:05:06.065 --> 03:05:08.085
You can see the demographics of the district.

3194
03:05:08.465 --> 03:05:10.845
You can see, uh, the breakdown

3195
03:05:11.185 --> 03:05:15.685
and, uh, miss Blackman, Jesse Blackman, uh, we, we listen

3196
03:05:15.705 --> 03:05:18.965
to you and you can see the breakdown of our, of our, um,

3197
03:05:19.455 --> 03:05:20.605
Asian communities

3198
03:05:20.625 --> 03:05:23.845
and Asian, uh, student groups in, in the district as well.

3199
03:05:24.425 --> 03:05:26.165
Um, that's, that's who we are.

3200
03:05:26.165 --> 03:05:27.525
And those are the students that we serve.

3201
03:05:28.825 --> 03:05:30.285
Uh, so with that, I'd like to,

3202
03:05:30.425 --> 03:05:31.885
so this is, uh, goal number one.

3203
03:05:31.945 --> 03:05:33.925
I'd like to, as I said, introduce, uh,

3204
03:05:33.925 --> 03:05:35.325
Curtis Har and Sherry Sweeney.

3205
03:05:35.325 --> 03:05:36.605
They're gonna present goal number one.

3206
03:05:40.715 --> 03:05:42.985
Thank you Dr. Campbell. Good evening, board of trustees.

3207
03:05:43.725 --> 03:05:44.785
Um, just a reminder,

3208
03:05:44.785 --> 03:05:46.745
when we're looking at the following data sets,

3209
03:05:46.775 --> 03:05:48.225
it's really important to note

3210
03:05:48.225 --> 03:05:51.625
that when looking at student group data, some

3211
03:05:51.625 --> 03:05:53.905
of the student groups have a really small population

3212
03:05:54.045 --> 03:05:56.665
of the overall Dublin Unified School district.

3213
03:05:56.775 --> 03:05:59.465
That means that the difference of one or of one

3214
03:05:59.465 --> 03:06:02.025
or two students can greatly affect proficiency levels.

3215
03:06:02.805 --> 03:06:03.825
Uh, goal number one

3216
03:06:04.005 --> 03:06:06.945
for last LCAP was on academic achievement.

3217
03:06:07.365 --> 03:06:09.825
So the goal is that Dublin Unified will increase

3218
03:06:09.825 --> 03:06:11.145
opportunities and support

3219
03:06:11.285 --> 03:06:13.425
for our traditionally underserved student groups

3220
03:06:13.885 --> 03:06:17.105
to improve academic achievement outcomes in English language

3221
03:06:17.105 --> 03:06:18.185
arts and mathematics.

3222
03:06:21.555 --> 03:06:23.695
So this first slide shows Renaissance Star reading,

3223
03:06:23.705 --> 03:06:26.415
which is a local measure given as a screener

3224
03:06:26.415 --> 03:06:29.255
and a progress monitoring tool for all first

3225
03:06:29.255 --> 03:06:32.855
through eighth grade students in the following slides.

3226
03:06:32.995 --> 03:06:37.095
The blue bar indicates the 2021, um, school year,

3227
03:06:38.385 --> 03:06:41.765
um, in which, um, the assessments were taken

3228
03:06:41.765 --> 03:06:43.965
during hybrid learning, and many students took those

3229
03:06:43.965 --> 03:06:45.205
assessments from their home.

3230
03:06:46.275 --> 03:06:47.525
Overall, you can see

3231
03:06:47.525 --> 03:06:49.965
that the star reading scores over the past three years

3232
03:06:50.035 --> 03:06:51.245
have remained consistent.

3233
03:06:51.755 --> 03:06:53.485
However, our black student group

3234
03:06:53.505 --> 03:06:56.805
and students with disabilities have a steady upward trend.

3235
03:07:00.005 --> 03:07:02.735
This slide right here is on our elementary cohort.

3236
03:07:03.315 --> 03:07:06.335
Um, so the cohort data here are for students

3237
03:07:06.485 --> 03:07:09.575
that were in our school system here in Dublin Unified School

3238
03:07:09.815 --> 03:07:12.455
District for each of the past four school years.

3239
03:07:13.635 --> 03:07:15.615
The reading data from our local assessment,

3240
03:07:15.905 --> 03:07:17.655
which is the star, um, we noticed

3241
03:07:17.685 --> 03:07:20.975
that most student groups have declining achievement levels

3242
03:07:21.165 --> 03:07:24.935
from 2021 through the 2324 school years,

3243
03:07:25.465 --> 03:07:28.775
while we see a significant drop in the all students group

3244
03:07:28.805 --> 03:07:32.015
from 78 to 62%, the beginning

3245
03:07:32.075 --> 03:07:36.455
and midyear percentage for our sixth grade group was at 80%.

3246
03:07:37.005 --> 03:07:40.175
This. Um, and also when reassessing the current seventh

3247
03:07:40.175 --> 03:07:42.535
grade cohort at the beginning of this school year,

3248
03:07:42.745 --> 03:07:47.175
those cohort scores had also recovered back to 80% at

3249
03:07:47.195 --> 03:07:48.215
or above proficiency.

3250
03:07:49.105 --> 03:07:51.775
While we dunno the exact reason, we speculate

3251
03:07:51.775 --> 03:07:54.575
that this drop in scores may be due to testing fatigue,

3252
03:07:54.715 --> 03:07:56.975
as the assessment was administered last spring

3253
03:07:56.975 --> 03:08:01.835
after the CASP test, in efforts

3254
03:08:01.855 --> 03:08:03.195
to achieve our district's goal

3255
03:08:03.195 --> 03:08:05.715
to have all students read on grade level by third grade,

3256
03:08:05.975 --> 03:08:08.875
we looked closely at our local result results compared

3257
03:08:08.875 --> 03:08:12.235
to the state CASP assessment results for our third graders.

3258
03:08:12.905 --> 03:08:15.515
When comparing the star reading results from the beginning

3259
03:08:15.535 --> 03:08:19.475
of the year to the state spring CASP ELA assessment results,

3260
03:08:19.815 --> 03:08:22.395
we see that our local assessments are typically good

3261
03:08:22.395 --> 03:08:23.595
indicators of

3262
03:08:23.595 --> 03:08:25.035
how our students will perform on the

3263
03:08:25.195 --> 03:08:26.395
standardized state assessments.

3264
03:08:26.935 --> 03:08:29.875
We also see steady improvement in the STAR assessments

3265
03:08:29.875 --> 03:08:31.395
throughout the year in all

3266
03:08:31.395 --> 03:08:36.105
but one student group Transitioning

3267
03:08:36.165 --> 03:08:39.705
to math, Renaissance Star Math is a local measure

3268
03:08:39.705 --> 03:08:41.105
that is given as a screener

3269
03:08:41.105 --> 03:08:43.305
and progress monitoring tool for all first

3270
03:08:43.305 --> 03:08:44.705
through fifth grade students.

3271
03:08:45.605 --> 03:08:47.025
The first three years was

3272
03:08:47.125 --> 03:08:49.425
for students in first through eighth grades.

3273
03:08:50.085 --> 03:08:52.545
But in the 2324 school year, sixth

3274
03:08:52.545 --> 03:08:55.505
through eighth graders took the i-Ready Math assessment in

3275
03:08:55.505 --> 03:08:58.665
lieu of the Star Cottonwood Creek, continued

3276
03:08:58.665 --> 03:09:01.665
to assess using both assessments to have comparative data

3277
03:09:02.085 --> 03:09:04.185
for all of their, um, first through eighth grades.

3278
03:09:05.205 --> 03:09:07.505
The blue par again, administers, uh,

3279
03:09:07.605 --> 03:09:10.465
or indicates the math levels that were administered

3280
03:09:10.465 --> 03:09:11.505
during hybrid learning.

3281
03:09:11.845 --> 03:09:14.465
And again, many students took that assessment from home.

3282
03:09:15.215 --> 03:09:16.345
Overall, you can see

3283
03:09:16.415 --> 03:09:19.465
that the math assessment data remains consistent in most

3284
03:09:19.465 --> 03:09:21.825
student groups with a slight improvement

3285
03:09:21.825 --> 03:09:24.625
for our black student group and students with disabilities.

3286
03:09:24.965 --> 03:09:27.105
And a slight decline for our Hispanic

3287
03:09:27.165 --> 03:09:28.705
and multilingual student groups.

3288
03:09:31.575 --> 03:09:34.275
So much like reading. We also have our elementary, um,

3289
03:09:34.545 --> 03:09:35.915
cohorts data for math.

3290
03:09:36.775 --> 03:09:38.875
And again, while the cohort data didn't decline

3291
03:09:38.875 --> 03:09:40.755
as significantly as it did for STAR reading,

3292
03:09:40.815 --> 03:09:43.875
we do still see a decline for all student groups

3293
03:09:48.565 --> 03:09:50.345
in efforts to achieve our district school,

3294
03:09:50.365 --> 03:09:52.905
to have all students on grade level by eighth grade,

3295
03:09:53.465 --> 03:09:57.085
we looked closely at our local i-Ready results compared

3296
03:09:57.085 --> 03:09:58.925
to the state CASP assessment results.

3297
03:09:59.705 --> 03:10:02.765
We see that the i-Ready Math assessment is not indicative of

3298
03:10:02.765 --> 03:10:04.845
how our students will perform on the state CASP

3299
03:10:04.845 --> 03:10:06.325
assessments in all student groups.

3300
03:10:06.515 --> 03:10:10.205
However, overall students performed higher on the CASP

3301
03:10:10.205 --> 03:10:12.485
assessment than they did on our local assessment.

3302
03:10:16.325 --> 03:10:18.615
Transitioning to our CASP assessment data,

3303
03:10:19.315 --> 03:10:22.735
the CASP assessment is given to all students in grades three

3304
03:10:22.735 --> 03:10:24.775
through eight and also in grade 11.

3305
03:10:25.595 --> 03:10:27.575
The graph above provides an analysis of

3306
03:10:27.575 --> 03:10:30.375
how our elementary students performed in English Language

3307
03:10:30.375 --> 03:10:33.495
Arts on the CASP assessment broken down by school.

3308
03:10:34.405 --> 03:10:36.855
Overall, we see that our Dublin students are performing

3309
03:10:36.855 --> 03:10:38.455
consistently on the casp.

3310
03:10:39.075 --> 03:10:41.895
We have seen continuous improvement at Dublin Elementary

3311
03:10:42.035 --> 03:10:43.175
and Murray Elementary.

3312
03:10:43.965 --> 03:10:46.095
Cole Elementary had the most significant one year

3313
03:10:46.095 --> 03:10:48.015
improvement with a 6% increase.

3314
03:10:48.865 --> 03:10:51.775
While we see a slight decrease at Amador Elementary

3315
03:10:51.775 --> 03:10:52.895
and Cottonwood Creek School,

3316
03:10:53.655 --> 03:10:56.735
maintaining near 90% proficiency is no small feat.

3317
03:11:00.285 --> 03:11:03.255
This graph, uh, above provides an analysis of

3318
03:11:03.275 --> 03:11:06.055
how our secondary students performed in English Language

3319
03:11:06.055 --> 03:11:08.335
Arts on the CASP assessments broken down by school.

3320
03:11:09.285 --> 03:11:11.415
Overall, we see a consistent performance

3321
03:11:11.415 --> 03:11:12.535
over the past three years.

3322
03:11:13.185 --> 03:11:15.575
There is a slight decline at Wells Middle

3323
03:11:15.575 --> 03:11:16.815
School in Dublin High School.

3324
03:11:17.435 --> 03:11:20.215
The Valley High School data is difficult to identify trends.

3325
03:11:20.235 --> 03:11:21.775
It is only for grade 11

3326
03:11:22.085 --> 03:11:24.095
with a relatively small student group.

3327
03:11:24.635 --> 03:11:25.975
We look at data by student

3328
03:11:26.315 --> 03:11:28.655
and by standard to identify additional ways

3329
03:11:28.835 --> 03:11:30.575
to support each student in need.

3330
03:11:34.015 --> 03:11:36.025
This graph above provides an analysis of

3331
03:11:36.025 --> 03:11:38.665
how our students perform in English Language Arts on the ca

3332
03:11:38.975 --> 03:11:41.465
CASP assessments broken down by student groups.

3333
03:11:42.585 --> 03:11:45.175
While our overall data for all students is favorable,

3334
03:11:45.675 --> 03:11:47.775
the student group data shows that there is still work

3335
03:11:47.775 --> 03:11:50.655
to be done to support all students in equitable ways.

3336
03:11:51.395 --> 03:11:54.735
Our African American Hispanic multilingual learners

3337
03:11:54.795 --> 03:11:58.255
and students with disabilities continuously perform at lower

3338
03:11:58.255 --> 03:11:59.895
achievement levels than the overall

3339
03:11:59.895 --> 03:12:01.095
population of our students.

3340
03:12:05.045 --> 03:12:06.905
The graph above provides an analysis of

3341
03:12:06.905 --> 03:12:10.985
how our elementary students performed in math on the CASP

3342
03:12:10.985 --> 03:12:12.665
assessments broken down by school.

3343
03:12:13.725 --> 03:12:15.495
Overall, there is an upward trend.

3344
03:12:15.495 --> 03:12:18.615
Since the adoption of the Eureka Maths Squared curriculum

3345
03:12:18.755 --> 03:12:20.295
as our elementary math program,

3346
03:12:21.485 --> 03:12:23.655
Cole Elementary School made the most significant growth,

3347
03:12:23.655 --> 03:12:26.535
again, 9% with six of the eight schools

3348
03:12:26.605 --> 03:12:30.055
with elementary students showing no change or improvement.

3349
03:12:34.715 --> 03:12:36.685
This graph provides an analysis of

3350
03:12:36.685 --> 03:12:39.245
how our secondary students performed in math on the CASP

3351
03:12:39.245 --> 03:12:40.965
assessments broken down by school.

3352
03:12:41.695 --> 03:12:42.995
The data shows no change

3353
03:12:43.095 --> 03:12:45.155
or an increase in each school except one.

3354
03:12:45.695 --> 03:12:47.395
Dublin High School showed a decline

3355
03:12:47.395 --> 03:12:49.395
after last year's three year high.

3356
03:12:49.975 --> 03:12:52.285
As a result, this year, we have increased the amount

3357
03:12:52.285 --> 03:12:53.765
of math intervention support

3358
03:12:53.865 --> 03:12:56.565
for the 24 25 school year at Dublin High School.

3359
03:13:00.525 --> 03:13:02.895
This graph above provides an analysis of

3360
03:13:02.895 --> 03:13:04.815
how our student groups performed in math

3361
03:13:05.035 --> 03:13:06.175
on CASP assessments.

3362
03:13:06.785 --> 03:13:09.535
While the overall data, again, for students is favorable,

3363
03:13:09.835 --> 03:13:12.855
we again see that this, that there is work to be done

3364
03:13:12.855 --> 03:13:14.855
to support all students in equitable ways

3365
03:13:15.275 --> 03:13:18.455
as our African American Hispanic multilingual learners

3366
03:13:18.555 --> 03:13:21.455
and students with disabilities continuously perform at lower

3367
03:13:21.455 --> 03:13:23.895
achievement levels than the overall

3368
03:13:23.895 --> 03:13:25.015
population of our students.

3369
03:13:27.955 --> 03:13:29.775
Now we're moving on to CASP science.

3370
03:13:30.995 --> 03:13:33.175
Uh, the graph above provides an analysis of

3371
03:13:33.175 --> 03:13:35.935
how our students performed in science broken down by school.

3372
03:13:36.355 --> 03:13:37.375
Unlike language arts

3373
03:13:37.375 --> 03:13:40.135
and math, science is only assessed in grades five,

3374
03:13:40.345 --> 03:13:41.495
eight, and 11.

3375
03:13:42.355 --> 03:13:45.015
As you can see, this is a highlight of our CAS scores

3376
03:13:45.035 --> 03:13:47.575
for last year with an 8% growth overall.

3377
03:13:48.755 --> 03:13:52.295
Amador Elementary and Fredrickson had gains of 15%

3378
03:13:52.315 --> 03:13:54.255
and 25% respectively.

3379
03:13:55.275 --> 03:13:58.295
Dublin Elementary and KB also improved by 9%.

3380
03:13:59.105 --> 03:14:01.415
Every elementary site showed no change

3381
03:14:01.435 --> 03:14:03.775
or improvement in CAS science Last year,

3382
03:14:07.235 --> 03:14:10.215
uh, this graph graph above provides an analysis

3383
03:14:10.215 --> 03:14:13.175
of our secondary students performed in science on the CASP

3384
03:14:13.175 --> 03:14:15.055
assessments broken down by school.

3385
03:14:15.665 --> 03:14:17.415
Again, we see overall improvement

3386
03:14:17.415 --> 03:14:18.655
with Cottonwood Creek showing

3387
03:14:18.655 --> 03:14:21.575
that 19% improvement in Valley High School,

3388
03:14:21.655 --> 03:14:23.335
a 10% improvement from last year.

3389
03:14:23.755 --> 03:14:27.095
All other sites had a slight decline in science CASP scores.

3390
03:14:31.085 --> 03:14:32.465
And this slide here shows our

3391
03:14:32.465 --> 03:14:34.425
how our student groups performed on the

3392
03:14:34.425 --> 03:14:35.505
Science Cast assessment.

3393
03:14:36.195 --> 03:14:38.825
Again, while our overall data for students is favorable,

3394
03:14:39.365 --> 03:14:42.185
the student group data shows that there is work to be done

3395
03:14:42.185 --> 03:14:44.105
to support all students in equitable ways.

3396
03:14:44.685 --> 03:14:47.385
Our African-American Hispanic multilingual learners

3397
03:14:47.385 --> 03:14:50.705
and students with disabilities continuously perform at lower

3398
03:14:50.705 --> 03:14:53.065
levels than the overall population of our students.

3399
03:14:54.005 --> 03:14:56.185
At this point, I'm gonna pass it over to Sherry Sweeney,

3400
03:14:56.505 --> 03:14:57.825
director of Curriculum and Instruction

3401
03:14:57.825 --> 03:15:00.065
to share our multilingual data findings

3402
03:15:00.065 --> 03:15:01.505
and next steps for Goal one.

3403
03:15:04.065 --> 03:15:06.815
Thank you, Curtis. Good evening. Good.

3404
03:15:09.345 --> 03:15:12.765
So, um, picking up from where Curtis left off,

3405
03:15:13.825 --> 03:15:15.165
we do have some data we wanted

3406
03:15:15.165 --> 03:15:17.805
to share this evening about our multilingual learners.

3407
03:15:18.345 --> 03:15:21.405
As you can see from this slide, um, we have a number

3408
03:15:21.405 --> 03:15:23.645
of languages spoken here in the district,

3409
03:15:23.645 --> 03:15:26.005
and a number of multilingual learners in our schools.

3410
03:15:26.515 --> 03:15:30.085
Approximately 5.8% of the population

3411
03:15:30.105 --> 03:15:33.005
of our schools is, uh, multilingual,

3412
03:15:33.545 --> 03:15:36.205
and that's down a little bit actually from last year,

3413
03:15:36.205 --> 03:15:38.325
which was 7.2%.

3414
03:15:41.325 --> 03:15:44.015
Here you can see the English learners by site.

3415
03:15:44.675 --> 03:15:47.775
And, um, again, um, we have

3416
03:15:48.775 --> 03:15:50.485
declined a a little bit in the number of, uh,

3417
03:15:50.485 --> 03:15:53.165
multilingual learners, the percentage in our district,

3418
03:15:53.425 --> 03:15:56.125
but we do now have five campuses, um,

3419
03:15:56.125 --> 03:15:59.565
where the multilingual learner population is at least 10%

3420
03:15:59.625 --> 03:16:00.965
of the student body.

3421
03:16:04.975 --> 03:16:07.865
This slide, um, and graphs show the multilingual learner

3422
03:16:08.145 --> 03:16:09.305
reclassification rate.

3423
03:16:09.885 --> 03:16:12.345
And, um, the question that came

3424
03:16:12.345 --> 03:16:15.105
to our mind when we saw this data was, um,

3425
03:16:15.365 --> 03:16:19.185
why was there in 21, 22, such a high reclassification rate

3426
03:16:19.185 --> 03:16:20.225
and then a drop again?

3427
03:16:20.565 --> 03:16:23.425
Um, and that's because reclassification was difficult

3428
03:16:23.425 --> 03:16:24.505
to do during COD.

3429
03:16:24.725 --> 03:16:29.625
So the 2020, uh, 2021 data, um, was limited in the number

3430
03:16:29.625 --> 03:16:31.305
of students who could be reclassified

3431
03:16:31.305 --> 03:16:34.145
because we do still use the state's, uh, four criteria

3432
03:16:34.165 --> 03:16:35.225
for reclassification.

3433
03:16:35.615 --> 03:16:37.385
When we came back into the classrooms

3434
03:16:37.385 --> 03:16:40.505
and were able to evaluate students more effectively in

3435
03:16:40.505 --> 03:16:42.265
21, 22, we were able to pick up

3436
03:16:42.265 --> 03:16:44.825
and reclassify, um, many of the students we weren't able

3437
03:16:44.825 --> 03:16:46.545
to reclassify the year before.

3438
03:16:47.005 --> 03:16:48.505
And so in these last two years,

3439
03:16:48.505 --> 03:16:51.425
you'll see the data is actually, um, pretty, pretty, um,

3440
03:16:51.765 --> 03:16:54.425
steady at 26% and 22%.

3441
03:16:54.855 --> 03:16:56.945
Most of our students, uh, who come to us

3442
03:16:57.045 --> 03:16:59.665
as multilingual learners in kindergarten, um,

3443
03:16:59.685 --> 03:17:01.785
are reclassified by second or third grade.

3444
03:17:06.225 --> 03:17:10.125
So, um, picking up where, um, you know, with the graphs

3445
03:17:10.125 --> 03:17:11.365
that Curtis shared

3446
03:17:11.465 --> 03:17:12.805
and the, uh, information

3447
03:17:12.805 --> 03:17:15.845
that I've shared about multilingual learners, we are, um,

3448
03:17:16.055 --> 03:17:19.925
still facing a persistent gap, uh, between student groups.

3449
03:17:20.385 --> 03:17:22.845
So there are student groups, um,

3450
03:17:23.585 --> 03:17:26.765
who consistently perform better than other student groups

3451
03:17:26.795 --> 03:17:30.485
when we disaggregate data, um, over a number of, of factors,

3452
03:17:30.545 --> 03:17:33.125
and that's something we have to continue to, to work on.

3453
03:17:34.955 --> 03:17:38.615
Um, one of the things you'll see in the next few slides is a

3454
03:17:38.615 --> 03:17:41.975
consistent theme about, um, continuing the work

3455
03:17:41.975 --> 03:17:44.335
that we know is research based and effective.

3456
03:17:44.875 --> 03:17:48.295
Um, we are focusing our work on delivering a guaranteed

3457
03:17:48.295 --> 03:17:51.415
and viable curriculum so that it's clear that, uh,

3458
03:17:51.695 --> 03:17:54.615
students are receiving, um, a high quality, rigorous

3459
03:17:54.635 --> 03:17:57.975
and engaging, um, academic program no matter where they go

3460
03:17:57.975 --> 03:17:59.895
to school and no matter who their teacher is.

3461
03:18:00.315 --> 03:18:03.415
So you'll see that we are focusing on utilizing district

3462
03:18:03.415 --> 03:18:05.095
adopted instructional materials,

3463
03:18:05.435 --> 03:18:08.215
common assessments across the board, um,

3464
03:18:08.215 --> 03:18:11.535
administering screening assessments to identify students,

3465
03:18:11.715 --> 03:18:14.495
um, particularly in ELA with reading difficulty

3466
03:18:14.635 --> 03:18:15.855
as early as possible.

3467
03:18:16.115 --> 03:18:17.375
You heard us give the, um,

3468
03:18:17.435 --> 03:18:20.175
report on early literacy just in the last board meeting.

3469
03:18:20.635 --> 03:18:22.695
And that's critical to the work that, uh,

3470
03:18:22.695 --> 03:18:24.015
we believe will close the gap.

3471
03:18:24.635 --> 03:18:26.335
Um, providing training, again,

3472
03:18:26.335 --> 03:18:29.015
we talked about this last meeting on the language essentials

3473
03:18:29.015 --> 03:18:31.135
for teachers of reading and spelling the letters, training

3474
03:18:31.595 --> 03:18:34.215
for all teachers in preschool through grade three.

3475
03:18:34.915 --> 03:18:38.455
Um, and then supporting PLC teams, uh, across the district,

3476
03:18:38.875 --> 03:18:42.015
um, in preschool through grade eight with delivery

3477
03:18:42.155 --> 03:18:44.055
of effective, um, ELA instruction.

3478
03:18:44.055 --> 03:18:47.540
So again, using research based, um, instructional strategies

3479
03:18:47.540 --> 03:18:48.860
and high quality instructional

3480
03:18:49.095 --> 03:18:50.255
materials is really important.

3481
03:18:50.955 --> 03:18:53.495
And then I really wanna highlight, um, one of the things

3482
03:18:53.495 --> 03:18:55.215
that we began to do this year

3483
03:18:55.235 --> 03:18:57.935
and are gonna continue, um, through the next three years

3484
03:18:58.035 --> 03:18:59.175
of our new lcap.

3485
03:18:59.435 --> 03:19:02.135
And that's, um, focusing on inclusion and belonging.

3486
03:19:02.285 --> 03:19:05.055
Because if we're gonna close the gap between, uh,

3487
03:19:05.255 --> 03:19:07.935
student groups, we have to focus on the things

3488
03:19:07.935 --> 03:19:10.535
that are making it difficult for some students, um,

3489
03:19:10.555 --> 03:19:13.695
to be successful in, um, academic programs.

3490
03:19:14.035 --> 03:19:17.055
And so we really have begun to, to deliver more, um,

3491
03:19:17.455 --> 03:19:21.535
targeted PD around how to include our students with IEPs,

3492
03:19:21.555 --> 03:19:23.375
how to be sure that we're giving supports

3493
03:19:23.375 --> 03:19:26.455
to our multilingual learners, um, to be sure

3494
03:19:26.455 --> 03:19:29.255
that all students can see themselves in our instructional

3495
03:19:29.495 --> 03:19:31.495
materials and feel like they belong as part

3496
03:19:31.495 --> 03:19:32.815
of the classroom culture.

3497
03:19:33.035 --> 03:19:35.695
So, um, that is something that, that we'll be, um,

3498
03:19:36.015 --> 03:19:37.535
drilling down on even even more

3499
03:19:37.535 --> 03:19:38.655
over the next, uh, few years.

3500
03:19:39.515 --> 03:19:43.335
Um, and then we've talked several times, uh, with you and,

3501
03:19:43.355 --> 03:19:46.335
and we'll continue to talk about coordinating timely

3502
03:19:46.695 --> 03:19:48.375
targeted tier two and tier three

3503
03:19:48.375 --> 03:19:49.895
intervention in our schools.

3504
03:19:50.315 --> 03:19:51.815
So that's begun to make a difference

3505
03:19:51.815 --> 03:19:54.455
and we believe to that we'll continue to see payoff, um,

3506
03:19:54.455 --> 03:19:56.575
from that, um, investment.

3507
03:19:57.275 --> 03:20:00.335
And then finally, in ELA, we will monitor reading levels

3508
03:20:00.555 --> 03:20:03.095
for all, uh, students in grades K through eight

3509
03:20:03.395 --> 03:20:05.215
and adjust intervention as needed.

3510
03:20:07.615 --> 03:20:09.155
You'll see some very similar things

3511
03:20:09.155 --> 03:20:10.435
here for math and science.

3512
03:20:10.965 --> 03:20:13.635
Again, this, um, focus on the guaranteed

3513
03:20:13.635 --> 03:20:15.435
and viable curriculum, ensuring

3514
03:20:15.435 --> 03:20:17.915
that all students have high quality instructional materials.

3515
03:20:17.915 --> 03:20:20.835
Curtis mentioned, um, the Eureka Math Squared investment,

3516
03:20:21.215 --> 03:20:23.115
um, in the PD training

3517
03:20:23.335 --> 03:20:25.075
and, uh, implementation is beginning

3518
03:20:25.075 --> 03:20:27.835
to pay off at the elementary level, um, there.

3519
03:20:28.495 --> 03:20:31.475
And, um, same thing with our science, uh,

3520
03:20:31.475 --> 03:20:33.755
instructional materials and instruction with Twig.

3521
03:20:34.415 --> 03:20:37.795
Um, in addition to the things that I mentioned about ELA

3522
03:20:37.795 --> 03:20:40.715
that we'll be doing, uh, that we'll also be doing with math

3523
03:20:40.715 --> 03:20:42.515
and science, we are beginning

3524
03:20:42.535 --> 03:20:44.355
to develop more common formative

3525
03:20:44.375 --> 03:20:47.155
and summative assessments for, um, for science.

3526
03:20:47.695 --> 03:20:50.875
So because the cast will become part of the dashboard, uh,

3527
03:20:50.885 --> 03:20:52.835
we're beginning to, to look a little bit more

3528
03:20:52.835 --> 03:20:53.875
closely at our data there.

3529
03:20:54.695 --> 03:20:59.515
And then, um, also again, monitoring math skills for,

3530
03:20:59.615 --> 03:21:02.595
for students in K through eight, uh, screening,

3531
03:21:02.785 --> 03:21:04.995
providing intervention as early as possible

3532
03:21:05.015 --> 03:21:07.755
as we identify skills that students need, um,

3533
03:21:07.755 --> 03:21:08.875
additional support with.

3534
03:21:09.335 --> 03:21:11.755
And then, um, adjusting intervention as needed

3535
03:21:12.215 --> 03:21:15.635
and monitoring that data, um, in both math

3536
03:21:15.635 --> 03:21:17.315
and science as students progress.

3537
03:21:20.555 --> 03:21:23.695
So at this time, uh, we'd be happy to answer any questions,

3538
03:21:24.235 --> 03:21:26.855
um, or hear your feedback about goal number one.

3539
03:21:28.945 --> 03:21:30.385
I don't have any questions. I had just one

3540
03:21:30.385 --> 03:21:31.465
really minor question.

3541
03:21:32.125 --> 03:21:34.185
Um, the multilingual is that students

3542
03:21:34.205 --> 03:21:35.625
who are not yet reclassified,

3543
03:21:36.665 --> 03:21:38.915
That is students who are not yet reclassified.

3544
03:21:39.195 --> 03:21:40.435
Okay. So they're, they're still

3545
03:21:40.675 --> 03:21:41.755
considered learning English.

3546
03:21:42.575 --> 03:21:44.875
Yes. Although, um, we do monitor

3547
03:21:45.565 --> 03:21:47.725
students once they're reclassified for three years

3548
03:21:47.785 --> 03:21:49.845
to be sure that they are, um, continuing

3549
03:21:49.845 --> 03:21:51.445
To progress because you probably have a whole lot more

3550
03:21:51.445 --> 03:21:54.165
multilingual students who have been reclassified

3551
03:21:54.165 --> 03:21:56.125
or are yes, are considered English proficient.

3552
03:21:56.125 --> 03:21:57.525
Yes, continue to monitor, but these are the students

3553
03:21:57.525 --> 03:21:59.285
that are just learning correct

3554
03:21:59.285 --> 03:22:00.365
English, still receiving services.

3555
03:22:00.475 --> 03:22:03.565
Okay. That was my one by one, uh, trustee Speck.

3556
03:22:04.385 --> 03:22:06.885
Um, thanks, that was a great presentation so far.

3557
03:22:07.185 --> 03:22:09.925
Um, lots more to come. Um, I had just a couple questions.

3558
03:22:10.105 --> 03:22:13.365
Um, so when I looked at the, um,

3559
03:22:14.095 --> 03:22:18.805
elementary versus secondary on CAF scores for ELA, it's,

3560
03:22:18.805 --> 03:22:21.325
it's fairly, um, similar.

3561
03:22:21.625 --> 03:22:25.765
So the elementary, if, if I go to just all DUSD is 81

3562
03:22:25.945 --> 03:22:29.725
and it's 78 for secondary 81 elementary, 78 secondary,

3563
03:22:29.905 --> 03:22:31.765
but there's a quite a big drop for the math.

3564
03:22:32.105 --> 03:22:34.005
So the elementary is 82,

3565
03:22:34.305 --> 03:22:36.685
and then the math for secondary is 68.

3566
03:22:37.425 --> 03:22:40.645
Um, do you have any sense, is this a,

3567
03:22:40.985 --> 03:22:43.045
is this a typical drop that districts see?

3568
03:22:43.465 --> 03:22:44.805
Are we unique in Dublin?

3569
03:22:45.265 --> 03:22:48.055
Um, I guess

3570
03:22:48.055 --> 03:22:50.935
that's my first question. Do you know, you

3571
03:22:50.935 --> 03:22:52.175
Know, well we, we do know

3572
03:22:52.275 --> 03:22:56.295
and we looked at, um, took a look at, um, cohort data, uh,

3573
03:22:56.315 --> 03:22:58.015
for both math and ELA recently,

3574
03:22:58.195 --> 03:23:01.455
and we looked at students who'd been with us for three

3575
03:23:01.455 --> 03:23:02.695
or more years, um,

3576
03:23:02.695 --> 03:23:04.935
and what was happening in their math scores.

3577
03:23:05.435 --> 03:23:06.775
Um, and one, one of the things

3578
03:23:06.775 --> 03:23:08.815
that we saw both on the ELA side,

3579
03:23:08.815 --> 03:23:12.455
but more so on the math side, is that drop in sixth grade.

3580
03:23:12.515 --> 03:23:13.855
So that the transition from fifth

3581
03:23:13.855 --> 03:23:15.175
to sixth grade, we know is tricky.

3582
03:23:15.755 --> 03:23:17.615
Um, for students. Um, we found that

3583
03:23:17.615 --> 03:23:20.215
that held true whether they were in a traditional K

3584
03:23:20.215 --> 03:23:22.535
through five and then onto a middle school

3585
03:23:22.795 --> 03:23:24.415
or whether they were in a K through eight program.

3586
03:23:24.955 --> 03:23:27.935
So that's an area that we know that we need to, um,

3587
03:23:28.215 --> 03:23:29.935
shore up the supports that we're providing

3588
03:23:29.935 --> 03:23:31.895
and the transition, um, that we're providing

3589
03:23:31.895 --> 03:23:33.895
for our students as they enter, um, sort of

3590
03:23:33.895 --> 03:23:35.375
that middle school, those middle years.

3591
03:23:36.155 --> 03:23:39.455
Um, but we don't know for sure about the,

3592
03:23:39.585 --> 03:23:43.135
about the drop consistently beyond, beyond sixth grade.

3593
03:23:43.475 --> 03:23:44.895
We also know, though, that students

3594
03:23:45.605 --> 03:23:47.575
math courses start to change.

3595
03:23:47.725 --> 03:23:49.375
They, they have more choices about

3596
03:23:49.375 --> 03:23:50.615
what math courses they're taking

3597
03:23:50.675 --> 03:23:53.375
as they move from sixth grade on through high school.

3598
03:23:54.035 --> 03:23:57.295
And so students are taking all students at a particular

3599
03:23:57.295 --> 03:24:00.375
grade level take the same cast test whether

3600
03:24:00.475 --> 03:24:02.815
or not that material happens to be

3601
03:24:02.815 --> 03:24:04.535
what they're actively learning this year.

3602
03:24:05.075 --> 03:24:08.175
So, um, we don't know the effect that that has,

3603
03:24:08.235 --> 03:24:10.975
but we have been talking about disaggregating some of

3604
03:24:10.975 --> 03:24:13.935
that data so that we can see by math course Okay.

3605
03:24:13.935 --> 03:24:15.775
That how students are doing. Oh, you went, went

3606
03:24:16.185 --> 03:24:17.185
Right where I was going. That

3607
03:24:17.185 --> 03:24:20.255
good job. Um, I was gonna ask that having, um,

3608
03:24:20.595 --> 03:24:22.415
my own kids who've been in the accelerated

3609
03:24:22.435 --> 03:24:25.495
and when they come to it, they're, you know, uh, one

3610
03:24:25.495 --> 03:24:26.735
of 'em was just very, oh my gosh,

3611
03:24:26.765 --> 03:24:28.215
I've gotta remember from the past year.

3612
03:24:28.215 --> 03:24:30.215
And I'm just wondering, um,

3613
03:24:30.525 --> 03:24:33.135
obviously we have some just stellar, you know, we,

3614
03:24:33.295 --> 03:24:34.895
I remember there was a press release last year,

3615
03:24:34.895 --> 03:24:36.815
how many kids got perfect scores on casp?

3616
03:24:36.815 --> 03:24:38.135
And so I'm sure those kind

3617
03:24:38.135 --> 03:24:40.495
of kids are in the accelerated math, but um,

3618
03:24:41.555 --> 03:24:44.205
but yeah, I'm just, I would be curious if there's any bit

3619
03:24:44.205 --> 03:24:45.805
of data there that, um,

3620
03:24:46.075 --> 03:24:47.605
that hurts us specific with the math.

3621
03:24:47.995 --> 03:24:49.205
It's a question we've had as well

3622
03:24:49.205 --> 03:24:51.245
and we are, um, working to okay,

3623
03:24:51.245 --> 03:24:53.885
disaggregate the disaggregate that GA data

3624
03:24:53.985 --> 03:24:55.565
by course and see what that looks like.

3625
03:24:55.675 --> 03:24:56.685
Okay, good. Um,

3626
03:24:56.685 --> 03:24:58.445
and then my other question was, uh, still on the math.

3627
03:24:58.545 --> 03:25:02.405
Um, so I remember a couple years ago

3628
03:25:02.405 --> 03:25:05.245
before you were doing the i-Ready Math, the star math, um,

3629
03:25:05.375 --> 03:25:07.925
you'd said, Hey, the ELA, like you said, today

3630
03:25:08.385 --> 03:25:13.325
for STAR indicative is a good, um, indicator for casp,

3631
03:25:13.465 --> 03:25:14.845
but Star math was not,

3632
03:25:14.865 --> 03:25:16.765
and now we're doing i-Ready and I heard the same thing.

3633
03:25:17.265 --> 03:25:21.555
Um, so I don't really know what my question is in there,

3634
03:25:21.695 --> 03:25:24.155
but, um, are we surprised?

3635
03:25:24.215 --> 03:25:25.715
Do we still believe in i-Ready?

3636
03:25:26.255 --> 03:25:27.875
You know, I don't know that it necessarily has

3637
03:25:27.875 --> 03:25:32.035
to be an in indicator to, to, to say that it's a,

3638
03:25:32.055 --> 03:25:35.235
the right tool, but I guess I, I'm wondering as the leaders,

3639
03:25:35.265 --> 03:25:37.475
what, what's your thought is on that? We've talked a

3640
03:25:37.475 --> 03:25:38.715
Little bit about that as well.

3641
03:25:38.815 --> 03:25:40.435
At least one of the charts that, um,

3642
03:25:40.575 --> 03:25:44.755
is in the presentation tonight, um, includes both star math

3643
03:25:44.815 --> 03:25:45.915
and then iReady data.

3644
03:25:46.135 --> 03:25:47.955
So you're not looking at the same data.

3645
03:25:48.015 --> 03:25:49.035
And so that's important.

3646
03:25:49.175 --> 03:25:51.595
Um, the iReady is a diagnostic tool

3647
03:25:51.595 --> 03:25:52.715
that's much more detailed.

3648
03:25:53.175 --> 03:25:56.835
Uh, and so we still believe that it is an excellent tool

3649
03:25:57.175 --> 03:25:59.275
to identify what students' needs are.

3650
03:25:59.415 --> 03:26:01.875
Um, and we haven't been using it long enough

3651
03:26:01.875 --> 03:26:05.155
to have a very clear indication about how it aligns

3652
03:26:05.155 --> 03:26:06.195
with CASP testing.

3653
03:26:06.775 --> 03:26:11.155
Um, but I think that we have had some anecdotal, um, uh,

3654
03:26:11.185 --> 03:26:13.675
data that we've looked at that that suggests that the

3655
03:26:14.185 --> 03:26:15.915
i-Ready is actually a little bit more

3656
03:26:15.915 --> 03:26:17.115
difficult than the cast.

3657
03:26:17.375 --> 03:26:21.875
So, um, so we're hopeful that CAST scores will, will be, um,

3658
03:26:22.255 --> 03:26:24.235
higher than what we're seeing in the i-Ready,

3659
03:26:24.415 --> 03:26:26.875
but we still, we still feel like the i-Ready is, um,

3660
03:26:26.975 --> 03:26:28.995
is very good data and is very useful in the

3661
03:26:28.995 --> 03:26:30.315
classroom. Okay,

3662
03:26:30.405 --> 03:26:31.405
Great. Thank you.

3663
03:26:31.405 --> 03:26:31.755

3664
03:26:34.695 --> 03:26:38.925
Thank you. Um, I guess this isn't,

3665
03:26:39.695 --> 03:26:42.785
this is kind of a general question and it includes goal one,

3666
03:26:42.885 --> 03:26:47.425
but um, you know, there is a lot of test fatigue out there

3667
03:26:48.205 --> 03:26:50.425
and uh,

3668
03:26:50.485 --> 03:26:53.385
and I know some of these are mandatory by outside agency

3669
03:26:53.455 --> 03:26:55.985
that we have no, no, no control over.

3670
03:26:56.285 --> 03:27:00.865
But, um, you know, those, a lot

3671
03:27:00.865 --> 03:27:04.585
of the students I've, you know, dealt with some

3672
03:27:04.585 --> 03:27:06.625
of 'em when my daughter was growing up

3673
03:27:06.685 --> 03:27:07.945
and, you know, talk to 'em

3674
03:27:07.945 --> 03:27:11.355
and all they, they don't see a need

3675
03:27:11.415 --> 03:27:12.915
to really do well on these tests.

3676
03:27:13.255 --> 03:27:15.475
It doesn't seem to do anything for them personally.

3677
03:27:16.295 --> 03:27:18.955
Uh, I know when I was growing up, I, you know, I,

3678
03:27:19.295 --> 03:27:21.075
if if it didn't, if I didn't see any benefit,

3679
03:27:21.215 --> 03:27:22.755
you sure I wanted to learn, I to learn,

3680
03:27:22.935 --> 03:27:26.355
but the test seemed to be completely beside the point

3681
03:27:26.455 --> 03:27:30.035
and you just answer, beat everything and move on with life.

3682
03:27:30.135 --> 03:27:31.475
You know, um,

3683
03:27:34.345 --> 03:27:38.965
have we ever thought about the data we actually look at is

3684
03:27:38.965 --> 03:27:42.725
like asking every teacher, like, in third grade,

3685
03:27:43.945 --> 03:27:46.965
how many students do you have that are not at grade level?

3686
03:27:47.425 --> 03:27:48.725
And 'cause they're right there

3687
03:27:48.725 --> 03:27:50.285
with the kids every day they know

3688
03:27:50.985 --> 03:27:55.565
and forget all this testing stuff and just, and, and, and,

3689
03:27:55.945 --> 03:27:58.565
and because the kids are trying

3690
03:27:58.745 --> 03:28:00.925
and they're, you're gonna try to do what they want,

3691
03:28:01.185 --> 03:28:04.885
but they know these tests have no, no meaning to them.

3692
03:28:05.265 --> 03:28:08.445
So what can we get more data that's,

3693
03:28:08.665 --> 03:28:12.285
that's more useful? Yeah,

3694
03:28:12.325 --> 03:28:13.325
I, I, I'll speak to that.

3695
03:28:13.545 --> 03:28:15.325
Um, so the assessment data that we use

3696
03:28:15.505 --> 03:28:18.285
for local measures is more of a screening tool to see

3697
03:28:18.285 --> 03:28:22.005
where students may or may not be at that proficiency mark.

3698
03:28:22.305 --> 03:28:24.565
And then we use other assessments within the classroom

3699
03:28:24.565 --> 03:28:27.485
setting to do deeper dives on where students may

3700
03:28:27.485 --> 03:28:28.485
or may not be struggling.

3701
03:28:28.735 --> 03:28:32.485
There absolutely are times when the assessment data from one

3702
03:28:32.485 --> 03:28:35.245
of these local measures or a CASP assessment does not match

3703
03:28:35.245 --> 03:28:37.325
up perfectly for what the day-to-day.

3704
03:28:37.825 --> 03:28:39.605
Um, student performance might be.

3705
03:28:40.185 --> 03:28:41.405
Our teachers, um,

3706
03:28:41.625 --> 03:28:43.965
during their collaboration time on Wednesdays,

3707
03:28:44.035 --> 03:28:46.805
look at their common formative assessments within their

3708
03:28:46.805 --> 03:28:49.645
classrooms and the learning that they see

3709
03:28:49.645 --> 03:28:53.245
that students are doing to then determine appropriate means

3710
03:28:53.245 --> 03:28:56.205
of support that may be needed both within the classroom

3711
03:28:56.205 --> 03:28:59.005
setting or for more intensive, uh, needs

3712
03:28:59.005 --> 03:29:00.285
outside of the classroom setting.

3713
03:29:00.345 --> 03:29:03.085
So yes, we do look at the day-to-day performance

3714
03:29:03.085 --> 03:29:06.205
of students, but this is important for us to also be able

3715
03:29:06.205 --> 03:29:10.125
to get that kind of aerial view of which students are above

3716
03:29:10.145 --> 03:29:12.365
and, and which students are below that proficiency mark

3717
03:29:12.365 --> 03:29:13.885
to at least give us a starting point.

3718
03:29:15.855 --> 03:29:20.815
Okay. Thank you Trustee Blackman, thank you

3719
03:29:20.815 --> 03:29:22.255
for walking us through this information.

3720
03:29:22.255 --> 03:29:26.215
It's a lot. Um, I will say that in some cases a lot

3721
03:29:26.215 --> 03:29:28.535
of the data is just sort of like holding, um,

3722
03:29:28.535 --> 03:29:30.815
there's just a couple up and downs, which I'm sure you see.

3723
03:29:30.915 --> 03:29:32.975
The one thing that I have I always struggle with is

3724
03:29:32.975 --> 03:29:35.295
that we get this, I love the fact the theme was on

3725
03:29:35.295 --> 03:29:36.495
page five of the document.

3726
03:29:37.075 --> 03:29:39.775
We broke down the data between third, fourth, fifth, sixth,

3727
03:29:39.775 --> 03:29:41.295
which is following the cohorts,

3728
03:29:41.295 --> 03:29:42.535
which I find really, really helpful.

3729
03:29:43.275 --> 03:29:45.735
The thing is, we don't get to what happens in seventh,

3730
03:29:45.795 --> 03:29:46.895
but then we get this eighth grade

3731
03:29:46.895 --> 03:29:48.295
and we're sort of like, oh, what happened in sixth grade?

3732
03:29:48.315 --> 03:29:49.655
You know, something strange happened

3733
03:29:49.655 --> 03:29:52.015
and I don't know necessarily how the students, like

3734
03:29:52.725 --> 03:29:54.535
what occurred Is it switching a campus

3735
03:29:54.635 --> 03:29:56.055
and finding your new grounding?

3736
03:29:56.575 --> 03:29:58.295
I also think that probably some of the testing

3737
03:29:58.395 --> 03:30:00.495
and the expectations are a lot more stressful

3738
03:30:00.495 --> 03:30:01.575
for students and it shows.

3739
03:30:01.755 --> 03:30:03.975
And so that there's this, how do I make,

3740
03:30:04.395 --> 03:30:05.495
how do I do well knowing

3741
03:30:05.495 --> 03:30:06.695
that I carry much larger load

3742
03:30:06.695 --> 03:30:07.775
than I did in elementary school.

3743
03:30:08.335 --> 03:30:10.775
I think we heard some of that also today with the students

3744
03:30:10.775 --> 03:30:12.975
who are presenting on the issues with regard

3745
03:30:12.975 --> 03:30:15.855
to mental health and the stresses of the, some

3746
03:30:15.855 --> 03:30:18.055
of the complexities of some of the courses that we offer.

3747
03:30:18.055 --> 03:30:20.615
And I've heard that actually a lot from students who've

3748
03:30:20.615 --> 03:30:22.215
graduated saying that we're really tough.

3749
03:30:22.915 --> 03:30:24.255
It helps them when they get to college

3750
03:30:24.615 --> 03:30:25.855
'cause they're really well prepared,

3751
03:30:26.275 --> 03:30:27.815
but it's very hard on them mentally.

3752
03:30:27.915 --> 03:30:31.415
So maybe some of what's showing up is, we've gone

3753
03:30:31.415 --> 03:30:33.935
to this point, which I've said last year is like stasis,

3754
03:30:34.525 --> 03:30:36.035
we're not moving the bar all that much.

3755
03:30:36.175 --> 03:30:37.755
The the changes are very minute.

3756
03:30:38.535 --> 03:30:42.165
So is there something we could do to, actually, maybe some

3757
03:30:42.165 --> 03:30:46.005
of it is just the stress of school is having an impact on

3758
03:30:46.005 --> 03:30:47.285
how they learn in the classroom.

3759
03:30:47.385 --> 03:30:51.445
And so, um, I look at a gap between not understanding

3760
03:30:51.445 --> 03:30:53.525
what happens at the end of sixth grade to the data sets

3761
03:30:53.525 --> 03:30:54.525
that show up in eighth grade

3762
03:30:54.525 --> 03:30:55.925
and then boom, we're in 11th grade.

3763
03:30:56.565 --> 03:30:58.325
I can't connect those dots

3764
03:30:58.325 --> 03:30:59.805
to see you're seeing all the data,

3765
03:30:59.905 --> 03:31:02.925
but from my point of view, I love the cohort information.

3766
03:31:03.005 --> 03:31:04.845
I just wanna see extracted a little bit more.

3767
03:31:05.485 --> 03:31:06.965
I understand we have an issue with math.

3768
03:31:07.525 --> 03:31:09.265
Um, it seems to be showing up prevalent.

3769
03:31:10.215 --> 03:31:12.555
My only, there's, there's not a lot of like things you can,

3770
03:31:12.995 --> 03:31:14.555
I mean there lots of things you can do,

3771
03:31:15.095 --> 03:31:17.155
but one of the things I always found really surprising is

3772
03:31:17.155 --> 03:31:19.195
that in this public school system,

3773
03:31:19.215 --> 03:31:21.835
we don't offer languages at elementary school level.

3774
03:31:22.415 --> 03:31:23.835
And I know that it's really important

3775
03:31:23.855 --> 03:31:25.635
for developing the math minded brain

3776
03:31:26.095 --> 03:31:28.355
and for students that deal with multiple languages,

3777
03:31:28.355 --> 03:31:29.835
they're probably better prepared for math

3778
03:31:29.835 --> 03:31:31.355
because they're dealing with multiple languages.

3779
03:31:31.455 --> 03:31:32.875
So it's just one of those things

3780
03:31:32.875 --> 03:31:35.475
where maybe there are other things we could start to look at

3781
03:31:35.475 --> 03:31:37.515
that might actually help us improve math starting

3782
03:31:37.515 --> 03:31:38.675
earlier in elementary school.

3783
03:31:39.175 --> 03:31:41.195
Um, I just think that some of the data sets,

3784
03:31:41.295 --> 03:31:43.635
I'm a little surprised when we see some steep drops

3785
03:31:43.635 --> 03:31:45.875
that just occur all of a sudden, like on the, um,

3786
03:31:47.055 --> 03:31:48.955
I'm looking at the star math and iReady

3787
03:31:48.955 --> 03:31:51.235
and all of a sudden the numbers just drop precipitously.

3788
03:31:51.385 --> 03:31:54.995
Like literally from 75 to 50 between two tests, star math

3789
03:31:54.995 --> 03:31:57.955
and i-Ready and I start to question is i-Ready?

3790
03:31:58.235 --> 03:31:59.835
I know you described that it's providing us

3791
03:31:59.835 --> 03:32:02.795
with certain information, but the drop sometimes is so much

3792
03:32:02.795 --> 03:32:05.715
that I start to wonder like, are we teaching to try

3793
03:32:05.715 --> 03:32:07.355
and understand what we need to get out

3794
03:32:07.355 --> 03:32:08.835
of i-Ready to improve those scores?

3795
03:32:09.455 --> 03:32:11.875
Or are the other tests actually providing

3796
03:32:12.035 --> 03:32:15.995
to be more fruitful because they're more reality based?

3797
03:32:16.025 --> 03:32:18.035
Like it's, I I'm just kind of curious.

3798
03:32:18.095 --> 03:32:19.315
The difference is so great in some

3799
03:32:19.315 --> 03:32:20.435
cases when the drops occur.

3800
03:32:20.855 --> 03:32:24.155
Um, one of the things I wanna dial back to is that, uh,

3801
03:32:24.155 --> 03:32:27.195
something we missed in the introductory presentation on page

3802
03:32:27.195 --> 03:32:29.515
two, we talk about, um, our student groups,

3803
03:32:30.725 --> 03:32:33.065
but we forgot the multi-ethnic groups.

3804
03:32:33.215 --> 03:32:35.345
There's, it's one of the largest growing groups

3805
03:32:35.345 --> 03:32:36.465
that we have in the school district

3806
03:32:36.465 --> 03:32:37.465
that's not on this chart.

3807
03:32:37.885 --> 03:32:39.265
We mentioned elsewhere in the document,

3808
03:32:39.285 --> 03:32:40.625
but we don't list those students

3809
03:32:40.625 --> 03:32:43.865
that actually list themselves as checking multiple boxes.

3810
03:32:44.445 --> 03:32:45.625
And so we need to quantify that.

3811
03:32:45.785 --> 03:32:47.785
'cause if this is a toll number of students somewhere buried

3812
03:32:47.785 --> 03:32:50.105
in this information or students that don't find themselves.

3813
03:32:50.525 --> 03:32:51.745
And the reason why I ask is

3814
03:32:51.745 --> 03:32:52.785
because I'm giving you an example.

3815
03:32:53.475 --> 03:32:55.985
Let's say I'm from Egypt. What box do I check?

3816
03:32:56.735 --> 03:32:59.625
What box do I check? There's not anything for me to check,

3817
03:32:59.685 --> 03:33:02.545
so I just pick other, not mixed, whatever.

3818
03:33:02.845 --> 03:33:03.905
So I sometimes find

3819
03:33:03.905 --> 03:33:06.065
that these groups I know are required to do it by law.

3820
03:33:06.335 --> 03:33:08.185
They don't really capture people

3821
03:33:08.445 --> 03:33:10.625
and probably there are other ways we could look at it

3822
03:33:10.625 --> 03:33:13.065
that might actually help us find ways

3823
03:33:13.165 --> 03:33:15.145
to engage students when they're struggling.

3824
03:33:15.655 --> 03:33:16.905
Like I don't see anything in here

3825
03:33:16.905 --> 03:33:18.625
that talks about single parent families.

3826
03:33:18.905 --> 03:33:20.305
I know that that's a struggle for kids,

3827
03:33:20.405 --> 03:33:21.465
but they're studying in other things

3828
03:33:21.465 --> 03:33:22.825
and it shows up probably in their test scores,

3829
03:33:22.885 --> 03:33:24.665
but we don't ever ask those sort of things.

3830
03:33:24.685 --> 03:33:26.625
So anyways, great information.

3831
03:33:26.705 --> 03:33:28.825
I don't see anything like really big surprising.

3832
03:33:29.045 --> 03:33:30.665
How do we get some of our groups that are fall,

3833
03:33:30.665 --> 03:33:32.665
they're still persistently at the same place.

3834
03:33:33.665 --> 03:33:34.935
There are new groups of students.

3835
03:33:35.495 --> 03:33:36.575
I know it's school one,

3836
03:33:37.385 --> 03:33:39.205
but I would ask if it we're showing

3837
03:33:39.205 --> 03:33:41.005
that consistency is carrying across

3838
03:33:41.005 --> 03:33:42.205
with new students coming across

3839
03:33:42.225 --> 03:33:45.565
and those groups are not improving, then it's not

3840
03:33:45.565 --> 03:33:47.245
that we're not doing enough, it's

3841
03:33:47.245 --> 03:33:48.725
that we probably have to switch techs.

3842
03:33:49.335 --> 03:33:50.635
We, we need to try something new

3843
03:33:50.635 --> 03:33:52.035
because even though we've been,

3844
03:33:52.245 --> 03:33:53.635
we've shown we're consistent,

3845
03:33:53.985 --> 03:33:55.835
that consistency is still holding

3846
03:33:55.835 --> 03:33:57.075
those students at a certain level.

3847
03:33:57.775 --> 03:33:59.795
So I would suggest thinking outside the box

3848
03:33:59.815 --> 03:34:01.075
and trying to find something,

3849
03:34:01.075 --> 03:34:02.595
embracing something completely different

3850
03:34:02.935 --> 03:34:04.305
because we need to find

3851
03:34:04.305 --> 03:34:06.305
however it is to connect with them, to lift them up.

3852
03:34:06.325 --> 03:34:08.065
So thank you very much for the presentation.

3853
03:34:13.545 --> 03:34:15.895
Sorry, I'll make my quick, um,

3854
03:34:16.415 --> 03:34:18.135
'cause John Durley Elementary School is right

3855
03:34:18.135 --> 03:34:20.575
behind my backyard fence, so

3856
03:34:21.095 --> 03:34:22.695
I just look at their day a little bit more.

3857
03:34:23.115 --> 03:34:26.975
Um, it's interesting to see the ELA hand math

3858
03:34:28.005 --> 03:34:29.365
dropping year by year,

3859
03:34:29.425 --> 03:34:32.885
but then there's signs is kind of same flat across.

3860
03:34:33.515 --> 03:34:35.485
Just curious if there's an explanation for that.

3861
03:34:35.485 --> 03:34:37.885
While all the other elementary schools are either holding

3862
03:34:37.885 --> 03:34:41.245
level or having smaller percentage drops, it just,

3863
03:34:41.525 --> 03:34:45.085
JDS just has this downward trend the last four years.

3864
03:34:46.145 --> 03:34:47.605
Do we have any, I mean,

3865
03:34:47.605 --> 03:34:48.805
it's just something that I found interesting.

3866
03:34:48.805 --> 03:34:49.885
You don't have to answer me now,

3867
03:34:49.885 --> 03:34:52.685
and just to see what kind of data, what kind

3868
03:34:52.725 --> 03:34:54.085
of stuff we can glean from that.

3869
03:34:54.835 --> 03:34:57.565
Yeah, the, the biggest, uh, the biggest thing

3870
03:34:57.625 --> 03:34:59.965
for Doherty Elementary School, and I,

3871
03:34:59.965 --> 03:35:02.525
and I would have to definitely do a deeper dive in regards

3872
03:35:02.525 --> 03:35:03.645
to which students there are,

3873
03:35:03.645 --> 03:35:06.245
but I will say that Doherty, out of all

3874
03:35:06.245 --> 03:35:08.365
of our elementary schools, has the largest number

3875
03:35:08.465 --> 03:35:12.245
of students that are intra district transfers, um,

3876
03:35:12.635 --> 03:35:15.565
from another school district, um, particularly Murray

3877
03:35:15.665 --> 03:35:18.205
to Dublin el or to, um, Doherty Elementary School.

3878
03:35:18.745 --> 03:35:23.325
Um, we've approved each year any, anywhere between 30

3879
03:35:23.465 --> 03:35:26.765
and 90 students over the course of the past three, um,

3880
03:35:26.765 --> 03:35:27.805
school years just

3881
03:35:27.805 --> 03:35:30.765
because of where students are zoned, where they live,

3882
03:35:30.825 --> 03:35:32.885
but they're, uh, zoned for the Murray area,

3883
03:35:32.945 --> 03:35:35.845
but intra, um, district over to Dougherty.

3884
03:35:35.865 --> 03:35:38.765
So that could be an impact, um, just in regards

3885
03:35:38.825 --> 03:35:41.165
to the amount of intra district transfers

3886
03:35:41.165 --> 03:35:42.165
that they have compared to

3887
03:35:42.165 --> 03:35:43.765
comparatively speaking to other schools.

3888
03:35:44.415 --> 03:35:46.405
Right. But the data is also conflicting

3889
03:35:46.405 --> 03:35:51.125
because sign scores are consistent, but then the math

3890
03:35:51.125 --> 03:35:53.125
and English, I mean, you gotta have English

3891
03:35:53.145 --> 03:35:54.725
and math skills to be able to do science.

3892
03:35:54.905 --> 03:35:56.485
So I just find that kind of interesting.

3893
03:35:57.905 --> 03:36:02.445
That's it. I think that's it.

3894
03:36:02.465 --> 03:36:04.365
So we can go on to goal two.

3895
03:36:15.655 --> 03:36:17.185
Good evening. I'm Bill Bronca.

3896
03:36:17.365 --> 03:36:19.265
I'm the Assistant director for, uh,

3897
03:36:19.265 --> 03:36:20.505
adult and career education.

3898
03:36:20.965 --> 03:36:25.825
Um, so I cover a lot of the high school, um, readiness

3899
03:36:26.525 --> 03:36:29.705
as far as college and career and as part of my assignment.

3900
03:36:29.965 --> 03:36:33.865
So moving on to lcap, um, goal number two,

3901
03:36:34.285 --> 03:36:35.645
and I'll just read this real quick.

3902
03:36:35.845 --> 03:36:38.125
DOSD will increase student achievement for all students

3903
03:36:38.225 --> 03:36:40.805
by providing a wide array of educational options

3904
03:36:41.145 --> 03:36:42.965
and ensuring that all seniors graduate

3905
03:36:43.205 --> 03:36:44.245
prepared for college and career.

3906
03:36:44.905 --> 03:36:49.005
So much of the data that you'll see in here, um,

3907
03:36:49.705 --> 03:36:54.325
covers measures that would address a lot of these things.

3908
03:36:54.515 --> 03:36:59.005
However, it also, um, measures our college

3909
03:36:59.005 --> 03:37:03.165
and career readiness that comes under the, um, dashboard

3910
03:37:03.165 --> 03:37:04.885
that will be out over the next month.

3911
03:37:05.425 --> 03:37:07.525
Um, the college career readiness indicator.

3912
03:37:07.945 --> 03:37:10.565
And so just to note that some of the data

3913
03:37:10.565 --> 03:37:14.585
that you see on here, any of the data that's, um,

3914
03:37:15.085 --> 03:37:16.265
around graduation

3915
03:37:16.365 --> 03:37:19.985
or A through g that's from last year's graduating class

3916
03:37:19.985 --> 03:37:21.505
class of 2024,

3917
03:37:21.855 --> 03:37:23.665
that comes from our student information system,

3918
03:37:24.005 --> 03:37:28.265
our infinite campus, if there's earlier data, um, on there,

3919
03:37:28.285 --> 03:37:30.985
that's usually outta CDE or data Quest.

3920
03:37:31.565 --> 03:37:36.185
And so that data for like the most recent data

3921
03:37:36.245 --> 03:37:39.945
for lack, we have that for our, um, graduating class,

3922
03:37:40.245 --> 03:37:43.385
but we won't have that for like California or the county

3923
03:37:43.485 --> 03:37:45.425
or until about a month from now.

3924
03:37:45.965 --> 03:37:50.435
So, um, the graduation rate, much of the data

3925
03:37:50.435 --> 03:37:53.515
that you'll see in here is stayed fairly flat.

3926
03:37:53.935 --> 03:37:57.155
Um, you'll see like a, a drastic shift,

3927
03:37:57.305 --> 03:38:00.555
like the 91% going from a hundred percent

3928
03:38:00.575 --> 03:38:03.555
for middle college, um, which falls under DUSD,

3929
03:38:03.735 --> 03:38:04.795
but that was one student.

3930
03:38:05.215 --> 03:38:09.675
So one student. And so when we measure students for the,

3931
03:38:09.895 --> 03:38:11.275
the way the state measures students

3932
03:38:11.335 --> 03:38:14.515
for high school graduation rate, it's a four year cohort.

3933
03:38:15.135 --> 03:38:17.315
So it's students that enter their freshman year

3934
03:38:17.975 --> 03:38:20.355
and that stay for the whole time.

3935
03:38:20.415 --> 03:38:22.435
And then you have students that enter over

3936
03:38:22.435 --> 03:38:23.875
that four years or leave.

3937
03:38:24.615 --> 03:38:29.405
The caveat to that is if they leave, we, they have

3938
03:38:29.405 --> 03:38:30.725
to be accounted for somewhere else.

3939
03:38:31.345 --> 03:38:32.845
So if they just fall off

3940
03:38:33.425 --> 03:38:36.285
and we can't account for them that they went

3941
03:38:36.285 --> 03:38:38.645
to another school district, like they never ask

3942
03:38:38.645 --> 03:38:40.165
for their QM file or things like that,

3943
03:38:40.475 --> 03:38:42.005
they get counted as a dropout.

3944
03:38:43.045 --> 03:38:44.985
So sometimes they're just,

3945
03:38:44.985 --> 03:38:47.225
they don't finish their graduation requirements

3946
03:38:47.445 --> 03:38:49.465
and they're a dropout, but other times

3947
03:38:50.015 --> 03:38:52.545
they get kinda lost in the system over those four years.

3948
03:38:53.405 --> 03:38:56.345
So that accounts for some of those students as well.

3949
03:38:57.235 --> 03:39:00.735
So Dublin Height stayed, um, I had

3950
03:39:00.735 --> 03:39:03.295
to keep checking these numbers 'cause it's pretty odd

3951
03:39:03.295 --> 03:39:06.295
that you end up with the same graduation rate,

3952
03:39:06.675 --> 03:39:08.815
but I did check the numbers, uh, several times

3953
03:39:09.315 --> 03:39:10.615
and then 98, 2%.

3954
03:39:10.635 --> 03:39:13.615
So they stayed actually, uh, very flat.

3955
03:39:14.155 --> 03:39:17.535
Um, with that, uh, valley High School dropped a little bit.

3956
03:39:17.955 --> 03:39:21.415
Um, I would say that some of those are students that, um,

3957
03:39:22.785 --> 03:39:25.235
that kind of got lost to the system in the four years

3958
03:39:25.655 --> 03:39:27.395
and didn't get picked up somewhere else.

3959
03:39:27.935 --> 03:39:30.075
Um, but those are also students that we need to,

3960
03:39:30.175 --> 03:39:32.385
um, uh, work with.

3961
03:39:32.445 --> 03:39:33.765
And some of the students we're,

3962
03:39:33.765 --> 03:39:34.925
we're continuing to work with.

3963
03:39:35.485 --> 03:39:37.645
'cause even if they move on, um,

3964
03:39:38.105 --> 03:39:42.005
and they come back, they get, still get counted as a, um,

3965
03:39:42.115 --> 03:39:43.125
dropout during that time.

3966
03:39:43.145 --> 03:39:45.325
So if they drop outta the system with,

3967
03:39:45.505 --> 03:39:48.365
and we don't know that they didn't, that they're coming back

3968
03:39:48.385 --> 03:39:50.965
for a fifth year to where we can mark them,

3969
03:39:51.715 --> 03:39:54.965
even if they come back and finish their high school diploma.

3970
03:39:55.745 --> 03:39:56.885
And it doesn't happen

3971
03:39:57.785 --> 03:40:01.685
before July when the data goes in, um,

3972
03:40:01.865 --> 03:40:03.965
it gets marked down as a dropout.

3973
03:40:04.505 --> 03:40:08.725
So, um, but we do, like if they do come back

3974
03:40:08.745 --> 03:40:12.485
and graduate later, they get marked, um,

3975
03:40:12.505 --> 03:40:14.045
in Infinite Campus that way as well.

3976
03:40:14.465 --> 03:40:16.405
But, uh, Mr. Bronca, just to be clear,

3977
03:40:16.515 --> 03:40:21.205
even though 98.2% both years is considered flat mm-Hmm.

3978
03:40:21.325 --> 03:40:23.365
That is an amazing graduation rate, correct?

3979
03:40:23.575 --> 03:40:24.365
Let's not forget that

3980
03:40:24.385 --> 03:40:25.805
that's one of the highest in the state.

3981
03:40:25.945 --> 03:40:28.485
No, it, it's, And it's like a hundred mark and

3982
03:40:28.485 --> 03:40:29.525
It's like much room to Go up

3983
03:40:29.585 --> 03:40:30.685
and it's like a hundred more kids.

3984
03:40:31.155 --> 03:40:33.605
It's like seven 60 to eight 70. Impressive.

3985
03:40:33.665 --> 03:40:35.605
So it's the same rate with a hundred more

3986
03:40:35.635 --> 03:40:37.605
correct to start with. Yep. Good.

3987
03:40:38.285 --> 03:40:41.205
I guess I'm so used to seeing the good data that it's,

3988
03:40:41.275 --> 03:40:44.745
it's, it's, Um,

3989
03:40:46.155 --> 03:40:49.335
the student groups, um, again, you'll see kind of some drops

3990
03:40:49.335 --> 03:40:51.255
with some of the student groups, um,

3991
03:40:51.625 --> 03:40:53.975
going from like a hundred percent to 96.9

3992
03:40:53.995 --> 03:40:55.015
for African Americans.

3993
03:40:55.615 --> 03:40:57.835
Um, and then also for the multilingual learners

3994
03:40:57.935 --> 03:41:00.835
and students with disabilities, you'll see drops there.

3995
03:41:01.335 --> 03:41:06.035
Um, this is also, um, a possibility that some

3996
03:41:06.035 --> 03:41:09.395
of these students that were in the earlier years, um,

3997
03:41:09.865 --> 03:41:14.195
were also had grades with the pass fail that we were using

3998
03:41:14.195 --> 03:41:15.595
during the covid time.

3999
03:41:16.135 --> 03:41:20.905
So some of those, um, graduation rates at,

4000
03:41:20.905 --> 03:41:22.265
during the 22

4001
03:41:22.265 --> 03:41:26.685
and 23 years, maybe a little bit artificially higher.

4002
03:41:34.095 --> 03:41:38.395
And then, um, our graduation, so all our students

4003
03:41:38.395 --> 03:41:43.345
that graduate, we look at how many pass the A

4004
03:41:43.345 --> 03:41:44.585
through G requirements

4005
03:41:44.845 --> 03:41:46.745
and A through G requirements is a set of courses,

4006
03:41:47.035 --> 03:41:51.265
everything from English, math, social studies, um,

4007
03:41:52.275 --> 03:41:56.265
world language, uh, college electives, um,

4008
03:41:57.325 --> 03:41:58.545
and they have to pass those

4009
03:41:58.545 --> 03:42:00.745
with a C are better, C minus are better.

4010
03:42:01.885 --> 03:42:05.225
So again, we have, they're counted out the number

4011
03:42:05.225 --> 03:42:08.305
of graduates, not the number of students in the senior year,

4012
03:42:08.305 --> 03:42:10.145
but the number of graduates, how many

4013
03:42:10.145 --> 03:42:12.305
of them completed the requirements?

4014
03:42:12.765 --> 03:42:16.305
So again, that continues to go up. Uh, 77.6.

4015
03:42:16.925 --> 03:42:18.825
Um, if you were to go back

4016
03:42:18.825 --> 03:42:21.265
and look at 10 years ago, it would,

4017
03:42:21.365 --> 03:42:22.425
it was like in the fifties.

4018
03:42:23.425 --> 03:42:26.525
So, um, we just continue to make strides in that.

4019
03:42:28.545 --> 03:42:30.445
Um, again, this is

4020
03:42:30.445 --> 03:42:33.365
where you'll see the data from a couple years ago.

4021
03:42:33.945 --> 03:42:35.445
Um, it's the most recent data

4022
03:42:35.445 --> 03:42:37.685
that they have in about a month from now.

4023
03:42:37.685 --> 03:42:39.045
They'll have the new data on there,

4024
03:42:39.545 --> 03:42:43.005
but we continue to be higher than the state

4025
03:42:43.105 --> 03:42:44.885
and county significantly.

4026
03:42:50.705 --> 03:42:52.245
And so this is the enrollment.

4027
03:42:52.245 --> 03:42:54.605
So when we say access to a wide range

4028
03:42:54.605 --> 03:42:56.245
of classes is kinda what we're talking about.

4029
03:42:56.345 --> 03:42:59.765
So our CTE courses and when we have CTE courses

4030
03:43:00.625 --> 03:43:04.365
and like a, our, um, computer science class for example,

4031
03:43:04.625 --> 03:43:07.005
that's both AP and CTE,

4032
03:43:07.465 --> 03:43:09.855
but our CTE courses, um,

4033
03:43:10.645 --> 03:43:13.775
because we have CTE teachers teaching them

4034
03:43:14.155 --> 03:43:16.255
and they have CTE standards,

4035
03:43:16.665 --> 03:43:19.095
those are courses like engineering, biomed,

4036
03:43:19.315 --> 03:43:22.775
but also like culinary and video graphics

4037
03:43:22.915 --> 03:43:24.775
or animation as well.

4038
03:43:24.875 --> 03:43:28.095
So, but our probably most popular classes are engineering,

4039
03:43:28.375 --> 03:43:30.815
computer science, biomed, and then culinary.

4040
03:43:33.055 --> 03:43:37.575
Um, and just the number of students we continue

4041
03:43:37.575 --> 03:43:42.175
to have in those and AP courses, um, continue to go up,

4042
03:43:44.475 --> 03:43:45.815
um, in this data.

4043
03:43:46.265 --> 03:43:49.295
Right now it's all DHS data.

4044
03:43:50.025 --> 03:43:51.605
So Emerald, right now, we have,

4045
03:43:52.185 --> 03:43:53.765
we didn't have any AP classes.

4046
03:43:53.945 --> 03:43:56.485
We had students that may have been taking an AP course,

4047
03:43:57.005 --> 03:44:01.525
a few students, but last year we did not have any AP courses

4048
03:44:01.955 --> 03:44:03.285
that were at Emerald This year.

4049
03:44:03.585 --> 03:44:05.965
We have eight courses, actually check that.

4050
03:44:06.335 --> 03:44:10.215
Seven courses and 18 sections, um,

4051
03:44:10.325 --> 03:44:11.735
with students in those sections.

4052
03:44:12.195 --> 03:44:14.095
Um, so we'll start having data

4053
03:44:14.595 --> 03:44:16.855
for those in future years from Emerald as well.

4054
03:44:20.295 --> 03:44:23.875
Um, the advanced placement exams, again, we had a little bit

4055
03:44:23.875 --> 03:44:26.895
of drop in the, the number exams

4056
03:44:27.475 --> 03:44:29.775
the students went up just by three students,

4057
03:44:30.195 --> 03:44:33.735
but the number exams, um, drop by two students.

4058
03:44:34.585 --> 03:44:38.415
And then the, the score with, um, three

4059
03:44:38.415 --> 03:44:41.015
or plus went down, uh, by a few points.

4060
03:44:46.515 --> 03:44:48.325
This is also a very high number.

4061
03:44:50.935 --> 03:44:52.865
Just say it before superintendent funk it,

4062
03:44:53.885 --> 03:44:57.665
Um, Especially with the number of students

4063
03:44:57.665 --> 03:44:59.265
that we continue to have to take those courses.

4064
03:45:00.205 --> 03:45:03.745
Um, now this is the number

4065
03:45:03.745 --> 03:45:06.825
of students within each ethnic group that took the exam

4066
03:45:07.445 --> 03:45:11.665
or actually that were in the, in the courses, AP courses,

4067
03:45:12.445 --> 03:45:14.185
and then the ones that took exams

4068
03:45:14.365 --> 03:45:16.905
and that the percentage is the number of students

4069
03:45:16.905 --> 03:45:20.995
that took the exam, um, of the ones that were enrolled.

4070
03:45:32.925 --> 03:45:34.465
And the last thing that kind of,

4071
03:45:34.465 --> 03:45:37.345
that's also covered again in the dashboard is

4072
03:45:37.345 --> 03:45:38.465
the CTE pathways.

4073
03:45:38.845 --> 03:45:43.605
And like I said, the uh, the, um, the CTE pathways,

4074
03:45:43.605 --> 03:45:47.525
we just, the number of students that complete, um,

4075
03:45:48.425 --> 03:45:52.765
the pathway as far as two courses, 300 hours, um,

4076
03:45:52.965 --> 03:45:56.285
a sequence of two courses within the same pathway, um,

4077
03:45:56.515 --> 03:45:58.085
that continues to go up as well.

4078
03:45:58.585 --> 03:46:01.485
Um, 317 of the seniors last year.

4079
03:46:02.705 --> 03:46:06.055
Um, but when they take a pathway,

4080
03:46:08.195 --> 03:46:09.805
there's kind of two things that happen.

4081
03:46:09.805 --> 03:46:12.165
Sometimes they're taking that pathway

4082
03:46:12.635 --> 03:46:14.565
because they think they might be interested

4083
03:46:14.565 --> 03:46:15.765
and then they find out later that

4084
03:46:15.765 --> 03:46:16.925
they're not maybe interested in that.

4085
03:46:17.135 --> 03:46:19.125
We've had students that have, uh, entered

4086
03:46:19.125 --> 03:46:20.565
that in like biomed

4087
03:46:20.865 --> 03:46:22.285
and went through the nursing program,

4088
03:46:22.655 --> 03:46:25.125
which the nursing program on its own is completing a whole

4089
03:46:25.125 --> 03:46:27.685
pathway because it's a 300 hours with the internship.

4090
03:46:28.425 --> 03:46:29.915
But they'll take that pathway

4091
03:46:30.455 --> 03:46:31.995
and they said they love the work,

4092
03:46:31.995 --> 03:46:34.555
they love being at the hospital, they love doing the stuff,

4093
03:46:34.855 --> 03:46:35.875
but it's not for them.

4094
03:46:36.685 --> 03:46:38.135
They want to go do something else.

4095
03:46:38.715 --> 03:46:41.255
So, but along that path

4096
03:46:41.975 --> 03:46:45.965
of completing those courses, they're learning all kinds

4097
03:46:45.965 --> 03:46:50.285
of other soft skills that will relate to whatever career

4098
03:46:51.305 --> 03:46:53.155
that they choose to go into in the future.

4099
03:46:53.615 --> 03:46:56.235
And also it'll help in some of their colleges

4100
03:46:56.535 --> 03:46:57.875
and their courses and the things

4101
03:46:57.875 --> 03:46:59.235
that they choose to do there as well.

4102
03:47:00.505 --> 03:47:05.055
So, um, one of the things that we're working on with, uh,

4103
03:47:05.055 --> 03:47:08.885
this as well is, you know, making

4104
03:47:09.485 --> 03:47:12.165
students more aware of the pathways and,

4105
03:47:12.465 --> 03:47:15.885
and, um, kind of taking courses

4106
03:47:16.595 --> 03:47:20.855
that might fit the pathway interest that they have along

4107
03:47:20.855 --> 03:47:23.255
with the Pathway courses or the CT courses as well.

4108
03:47:23.935 --> 03:47:28.295
Um, and there's all kinds of data that students

4109
03:47:28.325 --> 03:47:30.535
that are in a pathway that they enjoy

4110
03:47:30.595 --> 03:47:33.415
or complete a pathway do much better in college,

4111
03:47:34.115 --> 03:47:38.325
um, when they get there.

4112
03:47:38.985 --> 03:47:43.285
Um, and speaking of college, um, this is out of the, uh,

4113
03:47:43.565 --> 03:47:46.115
national Clearinghouse data.

4114
03:47:46.975 --> 03:47:49.475
Um, this, again, this is older data.

4115
03:47:49.475 --> 03:47:50.995
This is the most recent that they

4116
03:47:50.995 --> 03:47:52.515
have on the clearing house.

4117
03:47:52.515 --> 03:47:53.755
So it's 21, 22.

4118
03:47:54.175 --> 03:47:57.315
And this is students, this is measuring students.

4119
03:47:58.725 --> 03:48:03.215
Um, I wanna get this right. So 10 to six, let me make sure.

4120
03:48:07.375 --> 03:48:09.555
Um, 12 to 16 months

4121
03:48:09.555 --> 03:48:12.315
after they graduate, so 12 to 16

4122
03:48:12.315 --> 03:48:14.115
that they've enrolled in a college.

4123
03:48:15.165 --> 03:48:17.265
So that's what this data is reflecting.

4124
03:48:23.565 --> 03:48:26.945
So we don't have historical data on this slide right here,

4125
03:48:27.425 --> 03:48:31.965
but I would could tell you that, uh, much of the challenges

4126
03:48:31.965 --> 03:48:36.025
that we have or the student groups that we have, um,

4127
03:48:36.695 --> 03:48:39.865
that are not represented in some of these areas

4128
03:48:39.925 --> 03:48:44.265
or in some of these college choices are, um, the same.

4129
03:48:47.545 --> 03:48:49.765
And last, um, findings and next steps.

4130
03:48:50.225 --> 03:48:51.685
Um, we're always aspiring

4131
03:48:51.685 --> 03:48:53.365
for the a hundred percent graduation rate.

4132
03:48:53.825 --> 03:48:57.265
Um, I think, uh, as we, um,

4133
03:48:58.485 --> 03:49:01.495
look at data, um, from our, um,

4134
03:49:02.365 --> 03:49:05.815
changes in our grading, I think we'll see

4135
03:49:06.525 --> 03:49:10.255
over the next couple years changes also in the graduation

4136
03:49:10.255 --> 03:49:12.735
rate as well as the a e through G passing rate

4137
03:49:12.835 --> 03:49:16.875
or the, the meeting, the, those requirements because, um,

4138
03:49:17.955 --> 03:49:20.035
'cause it's not only, as they've talked about in some

4139
03:49:20.035 --> 03:49:22.395
of the, um, discussions about grading,

4140
03:49:22.545 --> 03:49:24.315
it's not just the grade itself,

4141
03:49:25.425 --> 03:49:27.275
it's the motivation factor as well.

4142
03:49:27.735 --> 03:49:32.555
And so, you know, getting that, um, the grade at least

4143
03:49:32.555 --> 03:49:36.595
to a point where they think they still have a shot of maybe

4144
03:49:37.115 --> 03:49:39.315
reaching college or even going to, to junior college

4145
03:49:39.695 --> 03:49:43.115
or community college, um, I think that we'll see

4146
03:49:43.115 --> 03:49:46.875
that those changes that you, uh, voted for on,

4147
03:49:46.975 --> 03:49:49.975
on our grading, uh, will make a difference.

4148
03:49:51.165 --> 03:49:53.985
Um, continue to, uh, build on

4149
03:49:54.405 --> 03:49:56.825
and leverage our, um, relationships

4150
03:49:56.825 --> 03:49:58.665
with Tri-Valley later in the spring.

4151
03:49:58.725 --> 03:50:01.585
I'm sure we'll have a presentation with, uh, ROP and CTE.

4152
03:50:01.845 --> 03:50:06.565
Um, but our relationship has opened up avenues

4153
03:50:06.565 --> 03:50:07.725
to create, um,

4154
03:50:08.345 --> 03:50:12.205
or to apply for grants that has brought in tons of funding

4155
03:50:12.305 --> 03:50:14.765
for us that we'll have for the next three years

4156
03:50:15.155 --> 03:50:19.205
that I think will hopefully offset some of the, um, pain,

4157
03:50:20.205 --> 03:50:21.945
um, that some of the cuts will bring.

4158
03:50:23.265 --> 03:50:26.005
And then also our relationship with Las Pita.

4159
03:50:26.265 --> 03:50:30.685
Um, right now we have, uh, a course happening at, uh,

4160
03:50:30.965 --> 03:50:33.085
Emerald and well next year

4161
03:50:33.225 --> 03:50:35.525
or next semester we'll have a course at both

4162
03:50:35.545 --> 03:50:36.965
Dublin High School and Emerald.

4163
03:50:37.625 --> 03:50:41.085
Um, they also helped with the geometry, um,

4164
03:50:41.085 --> 03:50:43.765
course in the summertime we had about 250

4165
03:50:44.045 --> 03:50:45.365
students complete that.

4166
03:50:46.275 --> 03:50:48.575
And then also we have,

4167
03:50:48.725 --> 03:50:51.815
this year we have about 30 valley students

4168
03:50:52.475 --> 03:50:55.215
taking a college course, um,

4169
03:50:55.485 --> 03:50:56.855
that they're gonna receive college

4170
03:50:56.855 --> 03:50:58.575
credit plus high school credit.

4171
03:50:58.595 --> 03:50:59.935
So they'll complete that course

4172
03:50:59.935 --> 03:51:01.655
and they'll get three times the high school

4173
03:51:01.655 --> 03:51:03.295
credit elective credit.

4174
03:51:03.835 --> 03:51:06.215
And, um, those students are doing really well.

4175
03:51:06.955 --> 03:51:10.575
And, um, it's a, uh, essentially a, a counseling course

4176
03:51:10.955 --> 03:51:14.375
or, um, under the counseling area, so a college

4177
03:51:14.395 --> 03:51:16.575
and career course that the, the Valley students are taking.

4178
03:51:17.035 --> 03:51:21.105
But, um, really what I would tell those students is

4179
03:51:21.305 --> 03:51:23.105
that we believe that you can do it

4180
03:51:23.565 --> 03:51:25.365
and we're gonna gonna show you

4181
03:51:25.365 --> 03:51:28.085
by having this college course here that you can do it,

4182
03:51:28.665 --> 03:51:30.925
and so that they can maybe get a taste of

4183
03:51:30.955 --> 03:51:33.845
what it'll look like, um, at Las Macias.

4184
03:51:33.985 --> 03:51:37.605
And part of that also was, it was part of the CCAP agreement

4185
03:51:37.635 --> 03:51:41.325
that you, um, have actually, um, uh,

4186
03:51:41.605 --> 03:51:42.725
MOU that you've signed twice.

4187
03:51:43.425 --> 03:51:45.925
Um, and that, so that helped with that

4188
03:51:46.185 --> 03:51:47.725
and having those courses there.

4189
03:51:47.985 --> 03:51:50.645
And what we're gonna see, I think, is being able

4190
03:51:50.645 --> 03:51:53.325
to get those students also with the CCAP agreement,

4191
03:51:53.825 --> 03:51:56.045
get them on field trips over to Las Pita

4192
03:51:56.305 --> 03:51:59.965
so they can really kind of see what, um, their potential is.

4193
03:52:01.465 --> 03:52:05.665
And we are taking another break for questions.

4194
03:52:06.615 --> 03:52:08.755
All righty. Any questions? Uh, trustee Blackman,

4195
03:52:09.845 --> 03:52:11.475
Thank you for the presentation Bill.

4196
03:52:11.975 --> 03:52:14.795
Um, a couple things. I just wanna do a rah rah.

4197
03:52:15.635 --> 03:52:16.755
I love the fact that you guys,

4198
03:52:16.755 --> 03:52:18.155
all the work you put into in creating

4199
03:52:18.155 --> 03:52:20.515
that summer course at Las BetUS, I'm thrilled to hear

4200
03:52:20.515 --> 03:52:22.275
what you're doing with Tri-Valley over there

4201
03:52:22.275 --> 03:52:23.595
because I think those students,

4202
03:52:23.655 --> 03:52:25.755
the experience they'll get from doing a college level course

4203
03:52:25.755 --> 03:52:27.235
will open their eyes to the potential

4204
03:52:27.235 --> 03:52:29.395
and sometimes that's what they need is to just see

4205
03:52:29.585 --> 03:52:30.635
what options are out there.

4206
03:52:31.215 --> 03:52:33.715
Um, from that point of view, I would ask if,

4207
03:52:33.835 --> 03:52:35.075
I know this is not our data,

4208
03:52:35.455 --> 03:52:37.435
but on the slide, it was on page 25

4209
03:52:37.445 --> 03:52:40.635
where you talk about those lovely multicolored bars of

4210
03:52:40.635 --> 03:52:44.035
where every student goes to college, not college, is that,

4211
03:52:44.135 --> 03:52:45.635
um, I find it interesting,

4212
03:52:45.635 --> 03:52:46.635
but I don't see us

4213
03:52:46.785 --> 03:52:49.755
that we looked at trades like there are a lot of students

4214
03:52:49.755 --> 03:52:50.795
that go into the trades

4215
03:52:50.795 --> 03:52:51.795
and it looks like we just kinda,

4216
03:52:52.195 --> 03:52:53.275
I don't know if we have the data,

4217
03:52:53.335 --> 03:52:57.835
but it'd be nice to show it also the, um, I don't, again,

4218
03:52:57.875 --> 03:52:59.795
I don't know if this is ours, but I think the real

4219
03:53:00.035 --> 03:53:02.995
differentiator is four year, two year, nothing in trade.

4220
03:53:03.555 --> 03:53:05.475
I think those are the four primary categories.

4221
03:53:05.755 --> 03:53:07.555
I don't think it's that important to differentiate

4222
03:53:07.705 --> 03:53:09.635
that they go to uc, A CSU

4223
03:53:09.655 --> 03:53:11.595
and in-state of private, it's just

4224
03:53:11.595 --> 03:53:13.035
that they're pursuing four year.

4225
03:53:13.055 --> 03:53:15.075
Now, if it's important for us to find out like that,

4226
03:53:15.075 --> 03:53:16.675
we're sending a lot of students to one type

4227
03:53:16.675 --> 03:53:17.875
of four-year school or another,

4228
03:53:18.455 --> 03:53:19.875
and it has to do with counseling

4229
03:53:19.875 --> 03:53:23.315
or our alignment with um, our state, you know,

4230
03:53:23.325 --> 03:53:25.035
graduation requirements, that's helpful.

4231
03:53:25.175 --> 03:53:26.715
But I think if we're looking at modeling and

4232
03:53:26.715 --> 03:53:29.355
after students that it really doesn't matter what type

4233
03:53:29.355 --> 03:53:31.035
of four year, it's just they're going to four year.

4234
03:53:31.375 --> 03:53:32.595
And the reason why I bring it up is

4235
03:53:32.595 --> 03:53:34.395
because some of our community college students actually do

4236
03:53:34.395 --> 03:53:36.355
go and, and transfer to a four year school,

4237
03:53:36.415 --> 03:53:38.475
but this document doesn't necessarily capture that.

4238
03:53:38.985 --> 03:53:41.635
Okay. My next follow up is that I know we've,

4239
03:53:41.685 --> 03:53:42.915
throughout the first goal

4240
03:53:42.915 --> 03:53:44.235
and the second goal, we aggregate

4241
03:53:44.235 --> 03:53:45.395
everything by these charts.

4242
03:53:45.895 --> 03:53:47.435
And the one thing I realize is listening

4243
03:53:47.435 --> 03:53:50.595
to everybody speaking is that we don't actually

4244
03:53:51.315 --> 03:53:53.435
re-aggregate the information around the groups.

4245
03:53:54.235 --> 03:53:56.875
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually take all this

4246
03:53:56.875 --> 03:53:59.755
information to develop a presentation about each group?

4247
03:54:00.215 --> 03:54:01.475
How are we seeing where they're going?

4248
03:54:01.655 --> 03:54:04.355
How are they doing their aps, how are they doing

4249
03:54:04.355 --> 03:54:05.795
with like sign up for these other courses?

4250
03:54:06.015 --> 03:54:08.315
Are they interested in getting their A 3G credits?

4251
03:54:08.315 --> 03:54:09.995
Where are we seeing the numbers coming down

4252
03:54:10.175 --> 03:54:12.755
or going up when they take their cast test?

4253
03:54:13.175 --> 03:54:14.955
In other words, like we break it all down

4254
03:54:14.955 --> 03:54:16.315
that compare each group to each other,

4255
03:54:16.415 --> 03:54:18.195
but it's not really a race between groups.

4256
03:54:19.055 --> 03:54:20.515
I'm sort sort of wondering like,

4257
03:54:20.515 --> 03:54:22.915
do we ever look at each group in its entirety

4258
03:54:23.025 --> 03:54:24.805
to say we're gonna paint a full picture of

4259
03:54:24.805 --> 03:54:26.765
what all these group, this one group is doing,

4260
03:54:27.265 --> 03:54:28.725
how can we see some connections?

4261
03:54:29.225 --> 03:54:31.805
So if I find that, that would be really helpful for me.

4262
03:54:31.965 --> 03:54:33.245
'cause I'm always trying to connect the dots,

4263
03:54:33.245 --> 03:54:34.925
but it gets a little frustrating for me.

4264
03:54:34.925 --> 03:54:36.325
But I really appreciate some

4265
03:54:36.325 --> 03:54:39.005
of the information you've presented on the AP side.

4266
03:54:39.905 --> 03:54:42.045
I'm thrilled. We have a lot of students taking ap,

4267
03:54:42.545 --> 03:54:45.325
but the data sets are showing that it's primarily one group

4268
03:54:46.225 --> 03:54:48.325
and I look at the percentages between the other groups

4269
03:54:48.385 --> 03:54:49.965
and there's just this massive cliff.

4270
03:54:50.715 --> 03:54:52.775
So I'm wondering, do students just not see,

4271
03:54:52.775 --> 03:54:54.935
like you were describing the, uh, the course

4272
03:54:54.935 --> 03:54:56.895
that you're doing for the Tri-Valley students over at Las

4273
03:54:57.095 --> 03:54:58.895
eu, do they just not see the potential that

4274
03:54:59.405 --> 03:55:01.735
they too can actually pursue AP classes?

4275
03:55:02.715 --> 03:55:04.855
I'm, I'm just worried that I look at the percentage

4276
03:55:04.855 --> 03:55:07.575
and the breakdown of students and we have like 80% Asian

4277
03:55:07.815 --> 03:55:11.055
students and, uh, less than 1% Pacific Islander.

4278
03:55:11.635 --> 03:55:16.375
Um, even multiracial is only at 5.4%. Those are huge gaps.

4279
03:55:16.995 --> 03:55:19.615
So although I applaud that we have so many students taking

4280
03:55:20.155 --> 03:55:23.095
aps, I get worried that somehow there's just the largest

4281
03:55:23.315 --> 03:55:25.375
of the rest of the student body doesn't see themselves

4282
03:55:25.375 --> 03:55:26.615
fitting in really well with that.

4283
03:55:26.955 --> 03:55:29.495
And to that extent, we have this advanced placement exam

4284
03:55:29.495 --> 03:55:32.535
data sets, but it doesn't really tell us of the students

4285
03:55:32.535 --> 03:55:34.015
that are taking the AP courses

4286
03:55:34.195 --> 03:55:36.415
and then decide to take the test, how many

4287
03:55:36.415 --> 03:55:38.375
of them are taking multiple AP courses?

4288
03:55:38.675 --> 03:55:40.215
How many of them are taking all the tests?

4289
03:55:40.955 --> 03:55:43.015
Um, because it could be just a handful of students

4290
03:55:43.015 --> 03:55:44.295
that are taking four AP classes

4291
03:55:44.395 --> 03:55:46.135
and they're, they're racking up all the exams.

4292
03:55:46.715 --> 03:55:48.735
And to that extent, I would actually like us

4293
03:55:48.735 --> 03:55:50.695
to track the scores that are four and above

4294
03:55:50.725 --> 03:55:52.055
because I understand colleges

4295
03:55:52.055 --> 03:55:53.495
and universities really don't accept the three.

4296
03:55:53.995 --> 03:55:56.255
If you wanna get the college credit, you gotta do a four

4297
03:55:56.435 --> 03:55:58.215
and that qualifies you to actually move on

4298
03:55:58.215 --> 03:56:01.095
to a higher level tier of coursework when you're in college.

4299
03:56:01.715 --> 03:56:03.975
Um, we can get that. That would be great.

4300
03:56:04.475 --> 03:56:07.295
Um, one of the things also that I wanted to ask about is

4301
03:56:07.295 --> 03:56:09.855
that we talk about some of our graduation rates, which are

4302
03:56:10.815 --> 03:56:12.575
phenomenal and I love that there are anomalies

4303
03:56:12.775 --> 03:56:14.575
'cause that shows that magic can sometimes happen.

4304
03:56:14.675 --> 03:56:17.015
But I know that we have summer makeup courses

4305
03:56:17.485 --> 03:56:19.775
that allow students to catch up so that they can graduate.

4306
03:56:20.035 --> 03:56:23.535
But I have heard, um, from staff asking a query

4307
03:56:24.245 --> 03:56:26.655
that when we offer those makeup courses in the summer,

4308
03:56:27.275 --> 03:56:29.415
do we have a different qualification

4309
03:56:29.795 --> 03:56:31.375
for those students during the summer?

4310
03:56:31.835 --> 03:56:34.815
To the extent that normally a student that wanna take, say,

4311
03:56:34.855 --> 03:56:37.535
geometry to makeup for the requirement a six week course.

4312
03:56:38.795 --> 03:56:40.695
I'm understanding that some of our courses are being cut

4313
03:56:40.695 --> 03:56:41.975
back to three weeks for those students

4314
03:56:41.975 --> 03:56:43.055
that are doing makeup credits.

4315
03:56:43.755 --> 03:56:45.175
And I've been asked to try and find,

4316
03:56:45.195 --> 03:56:46.775
and I would love it if staff's listening tonight

4317
03:56:46.775 --> 03:56:48.535
that we find out exactly why that is happening

4318
03:56:48.925 --> 03:56:51.695
because our students should be held to the same standard

4319
03:56:52.295 --> 03:56:54.095
regardless of what school or group that they're in.

4320
03:56:54.095 --> 03:56:55.975
So I would love some information here about

4321
03:56:56.155 --> 03:56:58.935
how we're addressing our summers, our students

4322
03:56:58.935 --> 03:57:00.655
that are making up credits that they can graduate.

4323
03:57:00.815 --> 03:57:01.935
'cause I think that's also an important

4324
03:57:01.935 --> 03:57:03.055
aspect for us to understand.

4325
03:57:03.595 --> 03:57:06.935
Um, otherwise, you know, this stuff, I mean,

4326
03:57:07.315 --> 03:57:09.415
we could be really selfish about it

4327
03:57:09.415 --> 03:57:11.295
and just say, wow, we're doing so amazingly well.

4328
03:57:11.395 --> 03:57:12.415
But I do think that there are

4329
03:57:12.415 --> 03:57:13.615
little improvements we can make.

4330
03:57:13.635 --> 03:57:15.695
So absolutely. Thank you for the presentation.

4331
03:57:17.885 --> 03:57:20.935
Trustee spec. Um, hi, I just had one question.

4332
03:57:20.965 --> 03:57:24.165
Question on the A to G. Do you have, um, any data that says

4333
03:57:24.165 --> 03:57:28.565
of the kids who don't get A to G is the majority of it

4334
03:57:28.565 --> 03:57:29.805
because of grades or

4335
03:57:29.805 --> 03:57:31.365
because of not taking the right classes?

4336
03:57:32.425 --> 03:57:34.525
Um, most of it's probably because of grades.

4337
03:57:34.685 --> 03:57:38.285
I don't have that like from last year's group, um,

4338
03:57:38.605 --> 03:57:41.125
specifically, but, um, a lot of times it's the English

4339
03:57:41.865 --> 03:57:45.005
and world language are the two top ones.

4340
03:57:45.585 --> 03:57:48.525
And um, 'cause most students, most of our students do get

4341
03:57:48.635 --> 03:57:51.485
that are on that track, um, are doing okay

4342
03:57:51.485 --> 03:57:52.485
with the algebra two.

4343
03:57:53.215 --> 03:57:56.155
Um, but it's the, uh, the English grade.

4344
03:57:56.225 --> 03:57:57.995
When you say the English, like English grade,

4345
03:57:58.455 --> 03:57:59.715
so like not getting the C

4346
03:57:59.715 --> 03:58:01.515
or higher, getting too low a grade in English.

4347
03:58:01.655 --> 03:58:03.435
And also world language is a big one

4348
03:58:03.815 --> 03:58:04.875
For the grade grade.

4349
03:58:05.265 --> 03:58:07.035
Okay. Okay. Because

4350
03:58:07.225 --> 03:58:09.595
Most of our classes right now, um,

4351
03:58:09.815 --> 03:58:11.435
are A through G eligible.

4352
03:58:12.315 --> 03:58:13.825
Right. Most of the classes That we have,

4353
03:58:13.855 --> 03:58:16.065
Yeah, I guess I'm thinking of like the fine art, right?

4354
03:58:16.165 --> 03:58:18.345
Um, you know, if

4355
03:58:19.445 --> 03:58:21.265
If and so like they, and so, and

4356
03:58:21.265 --> 03:58:22.665
because of our graduation requirements

4357
03:58:22.665 --> 03:58:24.385
and also the graduation requirements we had

4358
03:58:24.945 --> 03:58:27.025
previously most students were, um,

4359
03:58:27.245 --> 03:58:29.065
taking those courses, right?

4360
03:58:29.245 --> 03:58:31.305
So it's, it's mostly been a grade

4361
03:58:31.895 --> 03:58:33.225
from the lowest C minus. But

4362
03:58:33.365 --> 03:58:36.225
The graduate, the district graduation is the can,

4363
03:58:36.225 --> 03:58:37.385
the applied art can count,

4364
03:58:38.295 --> 03:58:39.425
Applied arts can count,

4365
03:58:39.605 --> 03:58:40.945
Can count, but they don't count for A

4366
03:58:40.945 --> 03:58:43.865
to GI can say I have a, I have a kid that yeah,

4367
03:58:44.055 --> 03:58:44.865
That really Made it to college

4368
03:58:44.865 --> 03:58:45.745
without being a to G

4369
03:58:45.945 --> 03:58:46.985
eligible. 'cause she didn't take a fine art.

4370
03:58:47.165 --> 03:58:50.765
Is that the only class that, um, is

4371
03:58:50.965 --> 03:58:55.565
I didn't either That puts you not at A to G

4372
03:58:55.745 --> 03:58:58.165
but still hits the minimum graduation.

4373
03:58:58.545 --> 03:59:00.925
It, it won't count for like either the art,

4374
03:59:01.775 --> 03:59:02.915
the art requirement

4375
03:59:02.915 --> 03:59:06.195
or like in some cases the, the applied art can't even count,

4376
03:59:06.735 --> 03:59:07.995
um, for a world language.

4377
03:59:08.095 --> 03:59:09.155
But it doesn't,

4378
03:59:09.395 --> 03:59:10.835
I think there's additional math too isn't,

4379
03:59:10.835 --> 03:59:12.835
don't you need three years of math for A to G

4380
03:59:12.975 --> 03:59:14.755
and you only need two to graduate from us.

4381
03:59:15.055 --> 03:59:16.875
And maybe it's science too, right? But

4382
03:59:16.905 --> 03:59:19.035
Like I said, most of the students are taking algebra two.

4383
03:59:21.315 --> 03:59:23.365
Okay. So, uh, we believe,

4384
03:59:23.365 --> 03:59:25.245
but we don't necessarily have the data for sure to say

4385
03:59:25.245 --> 03:59:28.285
that it's more a grade piece that is I can get that

4386
03:59:28.285 --> 03:59:31.365
Data if be Okay, if it's easy.

4387
03:59:31.585 --> 03:59:32.765
If it's not, don't worry about it.

4388
03:59:33.125 --> 03:59:34.405
Absolutely. Okay. Thank you.

4389
03:59:35.185 --> 03:59:38.005
Um, I just wanna commend, I I do appreciate

4390
03:59:38.005 --> 03:59:40.885
that both the CTE and the AP are are shared

4391
03:59:40.885 --> 03:59:42.285
because I do think they both play a very,

4392
03:59:42.285 --> 03:59:45.165
very important role in kind of a well-rounded kiddos.

4393
03:59:45.385 --> 03:59:48.385
And I think it's important that it's kids take both of 'em

4394
03:59:48.385 --> 03:59:49.505
because I think they, they both pay

4395
03:59:49.575 --> 03:59:50.665
play roles in doing that.

4396
03:59:50.815 --> 03:59:53.865
Yeah. I just know with the, the fine art tends to be kind

4397
03:59:53.865 --> 03:59:56.865
of a loophole that like culinary counts as applied art

4398
03:59:56.865 --> 03:59:58.865
so they can meet the graduation requirements

4399
03:59:58.865 --> 04:00:01.465
for the district, but it doesn't count as a A to G

4400
04:00:01.525 --> 04:00:04.875
but they weren't applying to any uc, so it didn't matter.

4401
04:00:05.015 --> 04:00:07.255
So we went our way.

4402
04:00:07.755 --> 04:00:10.015
Um, but yeah, I do appreciate that

4403
04:00:10.015 --> 04:00:14.515
and I, I think it's, um, helpful to have kind

4404
04:00:14.515 --> 04:00:15.995
of the, the breakdown.

4405
04:00:16.175 --> 04:00:20.415
Um, and I, it's nice to see that people are continuing

4406
04:00:20.415 --> 04:00:22.135
to take the test and pass as the number

4407
04:00:22.135 --> 04:00:23.815
of kids taking the classes increases.

4408
04:00:23.815 --> 04:00:25.935
Sometimes a lot more kids take it than like

4409
04:00:25.995 --> 04:00:27.055
the new ones don't pass it.

4410
04:00:27.075 --> 04:00:28.095
So I, I appreciate that.

4411
04:00:28.095 --> 04:00:29.455
And I know there's been outreach and I hope

4412
04:00:29.455 --> 04:00:31.735
that will continue to help all students feel

4413
04:00:31.735 --> 04:00:34.935
that like they are capable of taking an AP test, um,

4414
04:00:34.995 --> 04:00:37.935
or an AP class and then taking the test if they want to or,

4415
04:00:38.355 --> 04:00:39.815
or not if it wasn't their thing.

4416
04:00:40.355 --> 04:00:41.455
So thank you on those.

4417
04:00:42.955 --> 04:00:44.815
Any other ones before we go on to three?

4418
04:00:48.005 --> 04:00:49.005
Thank you. Thank you Bill.

4419
04:01:00.505 --> 04:01:02.285
All right. Good evening. Superintendent Funk

4420
04:01:02.285 --> 04:01:04.485
and board of trustees, Marco Taylor, director

4421
04:01:04.485 --> 04:01:05.925
of Equity Inclusion and Student support.

4422
04:01:07.355 --> 04:01:10.575
Uh, tonight I'll be providing an update on goal three,

4423
04:01:10.795 --> 04:01:13.815
our LCAP of our lcap, which focuses on creating a safe,

4424
04:01:13.925 --> 04:01:16.735
welcoming and inclusive environment for all students.

4425
04:01:17.285 --> 04:01:18.615
This is our wellness goal.

4426
04:01:18.915 --> 04:01:21.575
We aim to ensure that every student feels supported

4427
04:01:21.595 --> 04:01:23.295
and valued in their school environment.

4428
04:01:25.675 --> 04:01:27.935
Uh, let's start with some suspension data

4429
04:01:28.315 --> 04:01:31.055
for the 20 23 20 24 school year.

4430
04:01:31.635 --> 04:01:33.335
Our suspension rate has decreased

4431
04:01:33.355 --> 04:01:37.775
to 1.4% from 1.7% the previous year,

4432
04:01:38.065 --> 04:01:39.455
which is a positive step.

4433
04:01:40.005 --> 04:01:42.255
However, we continue to see disproportionalities

4434
04:01:42.435 --> 04:01:44.455
and suspensions among student groups.

4435
04:01:45.155 --> 04:01:47.975
Uh, for example, while African American students make up

4436
04:01:47.975 --> 04:01:51.335
3.5% of our student population, they account

4437
04:01:51.395 --> 04:01:53.895
for 16% of suspensions.

4438
04:01:54.435 --> 04:01:58.375
Uh, similarly Hispanic students represent 9.55%

4439
04:01:58.375 --> 04:01:59.615
of our student population,

4440
04:01:59.675 --> 04:02:02.415
but, uh, represent 20% of suspensions.

4441
04:02:03.315 --> 04:02:06.535
To address this, we focused on alternatives to suspension,

4442
04:02:06.535 --> 04:02:09.135
including positive behavioral interventions

4443
04:02:09.135 --> 04:02:11.735
and supports, uh, also known as PBIS

4444
04:02:11.875 --> 04:02:13.255
and restorative practices.

4445
04:02:14.095 --> 04:02:16.095
Additionally, we've partnered with characters strong

4446
04:02:16.115 --> 04:02:18.735
to guide staff and culturally responsive practices

4447
04:02:19.195 --> 04:02:21.855
and implementation science around, uh, MTSS

4448
04:02:21.855 --> 04:02:25.015
or multi-tiered, uh, systems of supports for our students.

4449
04:02:28.395 --> 04:02:32.375
Um, regarding attendance, our goal is to improve attendance

4450
04:02:32.595 --> 04:02:34.975
as we know this, this, this directly correlates

4451
04:02:34.975 --> 04:02:36.935
with student achievement in our district.

4452
04:02:36.995 --> 04:02:40.255
And yet instill chronic absenteeism, uh, remains a concern

4453
04:02:40.255 --> 04:02:41.855
that we are actively addressing.

4454
04:02:42.675 --> 04:02:46.295
In response, uh, we're taking a proactive approach, uh,

4455
04:02:46.295 --> 04:02:47.775
when students reach three absences.

4456
04:02:47.775 --> 04:02:50.255
Administrators make calls to connect with families

4457
04:02:50.255 --> 04:02:52.175
and identify any barriers to attendance.

4458
04:02:52.875 --> 04:02:54.295
Uh, if absences continue.

4459
04:02:54.355 --> 04:02:57.055
We use resources like the school attendance review teams,

4460
04:02:57.595 --> 04:02:59.295
uh, coordination of services teams.

4461
04:02:59.475 --> 04:03:01.975
And we're partnering, uh, with county services

4462
04:03:02.075 --> 04:03:03.295
to provide further support

4463
04:03:06.865 --> 04:03:08.285
And just more of our chronic absence.

4464
04:03:08.345 --> 04:03:10.165
Uh, chronic absence by student group data

4465
04:03:11.965 --> 04:03:13.025
and, uh, across data.

4466
04:03:13.055 --> 04:03:14.185
I'll come back to this as well.

4467
04:03:15.885 --> 04:03:17.780
And I want to talk about our, uh, mental health

4468
04:03:17.785 --> 04:03:19.685
and social emotional supports for our students.

4469
04:03:20.345 --> 04:03:22.525
Uh, student mental health is a top priority.

4470
04:03:22.705 --> 04:03:25.845
We offer tier supports, uh, through our school counselors.

4471
04:03:25.985 --> 04:03:28.085
Uh, if you look at the slide, uh,

4472
04:03:28.085 --> 04:03:30.765
tier one focuses on school-wide activities, uh,

4473
04:03:30.765 --> 04:03:33.605
to foster positive po uh, a positive climate.

4474
04:03:34.145 --> 04:03:36.045
And tier two and three, uh,

4475
04:03:36.045 --> 04:03:39.045
provide more targeted support including, uh, group

4476
04:03:39.145 --> 04:03:40.405
and individual counseling

4477
04:03:42.465 --> 04:03:45.565
to ensure students are supported his, uh, holistically.

4478
04:03:45.745 --> 04:03:47.205
Uh, we've as a district

4479
04:03:47.225 --> 04:03:48.765
and as a student, uh,

4480
04:03:48.765 --> 04:03:50.605
support team have leveraged coordination

4481
04:03:50.605 --> 04:03:52.365
of services teams at all school sites.

4482
04:03:52.985 --> 04:03:55.045
Uh, coordination of services teams, also known

4483
04:03:55.045 --> 04:03:57.325
as cost teams meet regularly, regularly

4484
04:03:57.325 --> 04:03:59.205
to discuss student needs, um,

4485
04:03:59.265 --> 04:04:01.885
and connect them with the appropriate resources covering

4486
04:04:02.125 --> 04:04:04.045
academic, behavioral and social emotional needs.

4487
04:04:09.535 --> 04:04:12.155
And our findings for goal three, highlight progress and

4488
04:04:12.255 --> 04:04:14.155
and areas for continued improvement.

4489
04:04:14.325 --> 04:04:17.235
While suspension rates have decreased, there's still need

4490
04:04:17.235 --> 04:04:19.995
to address disproportionality among certain student groups.

4491
04:04:21.215 --> 04:04:25.035
To address these findings, we've expanded our PBIS, um,

4492
04:04:25.055 --> 04:04:27.435
and restorative practices to reduce suspensions

4493
04:04:27.435 --> 04:04:29.475
and support conflict resolution at the school sites.

4494
04:04:30.355 --> 04:04:33.105
We're also strengthening our multi-tier systems of support,

4495
04:04:33.725 --> 04:04:37.025
um, and cost process to ensure students receive the academic

4496
04:04:37.045 --> 04:04:38.625
and social support that they need.

4497
04:04:39.235 --> 04:04:41.665
Additional efforts include professional development

4498
04:04:41.665 --> 04:04:44.385
for staff or professional learning for staff on inclusion

4499
04:04:44.405 --> 04:04:47.305
and belonging, creating wellness spaces across school sites,

4500
04:04:47.805 --> 04:04:49.145
um, and continuing partnerships

4501
04:04:49.145 --> 04:04:50.385
with mental health providers.

4502
04:04:50.845 --> 04:04:53.225
Uh, these steps aim to build a safe, inclusive

4503
04:04:53.325 --> 04:04:55.185
and sup supportive environment

4504
04:04:55.315 --> 04:04:57.225
where all students feel that they belong.

4505
04:04:58.405 --> 04:05:00.265
Uh, thank you for your time for goal three.

4506
04:05:00.485 --> 04:05:03.345
Uh, our focus continues to be on creating a supportive,

4507
04:05:03.345 --> 04:05:05.825
inclusive environment that addresses the social,

4508
04:05:05.825 --> 04:05:07.825
emotional academic needs of every student.

4509
04:05:08.005 --> 04:05:10.145
And I am happy to answer questions.

4510
04:05:13.295 --> 04:05:15.265
Trustee chair and then Trustee Blackman.

4511
04:05:16.315 --> 04:05:17.745
Thank you. This will be really quick.

4512
04:05:18.005 --> 04:05:20.945
Um, and you may have touched on it,

4513
04:05:21.205 --> 04:05:26.065
but going back to the suspension data, two

4514
04:05:26.065 --> 04:05:30.905
of the uh, uh, numbers have an asterisk biome.

4515
04:05:32.205 --> 04:05:34.385
Uh, and that's not defined in any work.

4516
04:05:34.405 --> 04:05:35.505
Can you tell me what those mean?

4517
04:05:38.805 --> 04:05:42.805
I do. I, I, I do not know why that asterisk is there.

4518
04:05:42.805 --> 04:05:43.805
That is a good question.

4519
04:05:44.665 --> 04:05:46.765
I'm not sure I could follow up about

4520
04:05:46.765 --> 04:05:47.805
why that asterisk is there.

4521
04:05:48.135 --> 04:05:50.205
Thank you. I would suspect

4522
04:05:50.205 --> 04:05:52.325
that they would either be un duplicated

4523
04:05:52.665 --> 04:05:56.455
or um, single suspensions

4524
04:05:56.595 --> 04:05:58.615
or the number of students outta a single

4525
04:05:58.615 --> 04:06:00.255
suspension. But we'll have to follow

4526
04:06:00.255 --> 04:06:01.255
Up. Yeah, we'll have to follow

4527
04:06:01.255 --> 04:06:01.495
up.

4528
04:06:05.815 --> 04:06:07.365
Thank you Marco, for the presentation.

4529
04:06:07.425 --> 04:06:08.765
Um, I wanna follow up a couple things.

4530
04:06:08.765 --> 04:06:11.845
That same chart that trustee chair was mentioning, uh,

4531
04:06:11.845 --> 04:06:13.325
you had noted a couple of the groups

4532
04:06:13.355 --> 04:06:15.965
that have a disproportionate number of suspensions,

4533
04:06:16.145 --> 04:06:18.245
but also there's an anomaly in some of the data.

4534
04:06:18.345 --> 04:06:20.765
If you look at the Asian group, their number

4535
04:06:20.765 --> 04:06:22.965
of suspensions almost doubled in the last year.

4536
04:06:22.985 --> 04:06:24.845
Mm-Hmm. And that just seems like an

4537
04:06:24.845 --> 04:06:26.165
incredibly unusual spike.

4538
04:06:26.265 --> 04:06:28.685
So it'd be great to find out what's going on there, if

4539
04:06:28.685 --> 04:06:30.485
that was just a single incident

4540
04:06:30.625 --> 04:06:33.245
or maybe follow up on multiple incidents and try

4541
04:06:33.405 --> 04:06:35.965
and find out how we could work on that a little bit.

4542
04:06:35.965 --> 04:06:38.165
Thank you. Um, another thing, I know

4543
04:06:38.165 --> 04:06:39.565
that in the slides it wasn't included,

4544
04:06:39.625 --> 04:06:43.285
but there was a component in the booklet about Panorama

4545
04:06:44.095 --> 04:06:47.405
study and we still are showing persistently

4546
04:06:48.105 --> 04:06:51.125
not desirable percentages of sense of belonging

4547
04:06:51.185 --> 04:06:54.205
for our middle and high school student groups.

4548
04:06:54.985 --> 04:06:58.365
Um, I know that that's a really big part of mental health

4549
04:06:58.865 --> 04:07:00.085
and supporting our students.

4550
04:07:00.265 --> 04:07:03.165
So I don't, I don't see a change occurring

4551
04:07:03.285 --> 04:07:05.725
'cause we're at 38% like in 20 21, 22

4552
04:07:05.725 --> 04:07:06.925
then three six and three six.

4553
04:07:07.305 --> 04:07:09.245
So it seems like it's leveling off

4554
04:07:09.265 --> 04:07:11.445
and I think this is like one of those like things

4555
04:07:11.445 --> 04:07:12.565
where you see a number like this

4556
04:07:12.565 --> 04:07:13.885
and you're like, this is an emergency.

4557
04:07:14.785 --> 04:07:18.125
So I would love it if there was some sort of strategic plan

4558
04:07:18.185 --> 04:07:21.765
for actually looking at how we can improve that, um, sense

4559
04:07:21.765 --> 04:07:22.885
of belonging for those students.

4560
04:07:22.985 --> 04:07:25.125
And it may just be the adjustment we talked about going from

4561
04:07:25.125 --> 04:07:26.325
elementary school to middle school

4562
04:07:26.345 --> 04:07:29.205
and the intensity of learning and the requirements,

4563
04:07:29.505 --> 04:07:32.165
but it seems to be persistent across those grades

4564
04:07:32.265 --> 04:07:35.245
and that's a lot to see that happening and consistently.

4565
04:07:35.705 --> 04:07:40.045
Um, the last question I wanna ask was about the coordination

4566
04:07:40.045 --> 04:07:41.525
of uh, service team.

4567
04:07:42.065 --> 04:07:44.645
The number of students served by cost on that slide.

4568
04:07:45.265 --> 04:07:48.485
Um, last year there was a spike in elementary school.

4569
04:07:49.225 --> 04:07:51.405
Um, the norm was, you know, had been coming down.

4570
04:07:51.505 --> 04:07:55.125
It was in 20 22, 23 at 180 5, but that spiked to 400.

4571
04:07:55.325 --> 04:07:57.205
I was wondering if there was anything that was sort of like

4572
04:07:57.895 --> 04:07:59.565
indicative of why that happened.

4573
04:07:59.565 --> 04:08:01.525
Were we just more sensitive to the information

4574
04:08:01.525 --> 04:08:04.325
and so our numbers just crept up a lot?

4575
04:08:04.865 --> 04:08:06.125
Or was it just something that we missed?

4576
04:08:06.305 --> 04:08:08.245
So I was hoping you could answer or give us some.

4577
04:08:08.555 --> 04:08:10.845
Yeah. Um, that is worth looking into.

4578
04:08:10.945 --> 04:08:12.885
Uh, that is a conversation that we could have

4579
04:08:12.885 --> 04:08:14.925
with our school counselors and site principals to

4580
04:08:15.525 --> 04:08:17.325
identify the number of referrals that went up

4581
04:08:17.385 --> 04:08:19.005
and why those went up. Yeah.

4582
04:08:19.675 --> 04:08:20.105
Thank you.

4583
04:08:24.785 --> 04:08:28.075
Any other questions? Thank you.

4584
04:08:29.015 --> 04:08:32.315
And go on, I think four is,

4585
04:08:33.995 --> 04:08:37.045
four is like something that doesn't really have data

4586
04:08:37.585 --> 04:08:38.585
Four's in the book.

4587
04:08:39.145 --> 04:08:40.965
Um, it's kind of our basics.

4588
04:08:41.425 --> 04:08:43.565
Um, and the Williams reporting things,

4589
04:08:43.565 --> 04:08:45.125
which I know you get those reports as well.

4590
04:08:45.345 --> 04:08:47.245
So we thought we'd kind of go to the media part

4591
04:08:47.245 --> 04:08:48.725
of, um, goal five.

4592
04:08:49.585 --> 04:08:53.305
So I'm Goal five is all centered

4593
04:08:53.305 --> 04:08:54.705
around community engagement.

4594
04:08:54.885 --> 04:08:57.425
Um, specifically DUSD will engage parents

4595
04:08:57.485 --> 04:08:59.305
and students to strengthen partnerships

4596
04:08:59.605 --> 04:09:01.105
to maximize student learning.

4597
04:09:02.975 --> 04:09:05.425
Basically to continuously assess the effectiveness

4598
04:09:05.425 --> 04:09:07.265
of our strategies, we have

4599
04:09:07.265 --> 04:09:09.305
to regularly collect feedback from

4600
04:09:09.305 --> 04:09:10.505
our students and families.

4601
04:09:10.855 --> 04:09:13.730
This data informs ongoing improvements in our engagement

4602
04:09:13.730 --> 04:09:16.245
strategies and district policies, ensuring

4603
04:09:16.245 --> 04:09:18.965
that we remain responsive to the evolving needs

4604
04:09:18.965 --> 04:09:20.325
of our educational community.

4605
04:09:24.365 --> 04:09:25.785
Um, I know we talked about Pan

4606
04:09:25.785 --> 04:09:27.305
Panorama was brought up a little bit.

4607
04:09:27.345 --> 04:09:30.625
Panorama is our platform for um,

4608
04:09:30.735 --> 04:09:32.545
getting our data from our students

4609
04:09:32.605 --> 04:09:34.865
and families kind of on that social emotional piece.

4610
04:09:35.645 --> 04:09:39.385
Um, so when we, when the panorama goes out

4611
04:09:39.385 --> 04:09:42.745
and surveys the families of third through 12th graders,

4612
04:09:43.295 --> 04:09:45.105
it's surveying those four categories.

4613
04:09:45.295 --> 04:09:47.705
Goal climate learning behaviors, school fit

4614
04:09:47.885 --> 04:09:49.185
and family engagement.

4615
04:09:50.135 --> 04:09:52.985
When you're looking at the three year kind of data,

4616
04:09:53.085 --> 04:09:54.905
we see kind of some ups and downs,

4617
04:09:55.685 --> 04:09:59.105
but really kind of uh, consistent over the three years

4618
04:09:59.735 --> 04:10:02.425
when looking at family engagement, we recognize

4619
04:10:02.425 --> 04:10:04.425
that is something we continuously work on

4620
04:10:04.805 --> 04:10:06.345
and want to improve further.

4621
04:10:11.875 --> 04:10:15.975
Um, our STU student survey is um, a little bit different.

4622
04:10:16.285 --> 04:10:18.415
Student voice is another element that we wanted

4623
04:10:18.435 --> 04:10:20.335
to continue to include.

4624
04:10:20.675 --> 04:10:21.895
We monitor student voice

4625
04:10:21.915 --> 04:10:24.375
to ensure they feel their educational needs are being met

4626
04:10:24.395 --> 04:10:26.775
and that they feel safe and supported while in school.

4627
04:10:28.435 --> 04:10:30.245
So the students in grades three

4628
04:10:30.245 --> 04:10:32.365
through 12 were surveyed on their competency

4629
04:10:32.365 --> 04:10:33.965
and wellbeing in the following areas.

4630
04:10:34.225 --> 04:10:35.765
Social awareness, which is

4631
04:10:35.765 --> 04:10:38.165
how well students consider the perspectives of others

4632
04:10:38.265 --> 04:10:40.005
and EI empathize with them.

4633
04:10:40.185 --> 04:10:41.725
Excuse me. Grit.

4634
04:10:41.825 --> 04:10:45.005
How well students are able to persevere through setbacks

4635
04:10:45.225 --> 04:10:47.325
to achieve important long-term goals.

4636
04:10:48.185 --> 04:10:50.325
Growth mindset students' perceptions

4637
04:10:50.325 --> 04:10:52.725
of whether they have the potential to change those factors

4638
04:10:52.955 --> 04:10:54.885
that are central to their performance in school

4639
04:10:55.465 --> 04:10:56.565
and self-efficacy.

4640
04:10:56.945 --> 04:10:58.965
How much students believe they can succeed in

4641
04:10:58.965 --> 04:11:00.645
achieving academic outcomes.

4642
04:11:02.735 --> 04:11:06.275
So when compared to a 20, 22, 23,

4643
04:11:07.005 --> 04:11:08.635
there are 2324.

4644
04:11:08.815 --> 04:11:10.875
You can see for our grades three through five.

4645
04:11:11.455 --> 04:11:13.835
Um, the first two really were no changed

4646
04:11:14.025 --> 04:11:15.235
year after year over year.

4647
04:11:15.495 --> 04:11:18.315
Growth mindset was down three percentage points

4648
04:11:18.535 --> 04:11:20.275
and self-efficacy was up one.

4649
04:11:21.175 --> 04:11:25.875
And then, um, our secondary data is pretty similar, um, with

4650
04:11:25.875 --> 04:11:28.315
that social awareness and it also had no change.

4651
04:11:29.095 --> 04:11:32.595
Um, grit's a little, um, lower at the secondary level,

4652
04:11:32.615 --> 04:11:33.755
but it did increase one.

4653
04:11:34.575 --> 04:11:37.835
Um, growth mindsets the same only had

4654
04:11:37.835 --> 04:11:39.075
increased three instead of decreased.

4655
04:11:39.375 --> 04:11:43.395
And self-efficacy, um, is one of the lower ones there

4656
04:11:43.575 --> 04:11:46.725
for our secondary with a drop of one percentage.

4657
04:11:46.725 --> 04:11:51.625
Point language line is a

4658
04:11:51.625 --> 04:11:54.185
translation service we use that's um,

4659
04:11:54.185 --> 04:11:55.345
accessible by all staff.

4660
04:11:55.405 --> 04:11:58.585
So teachers will be using them during conferences, um,

4661
04:11:58.715 --> 04:12:01.145
where there's, they can dial into the language line

4662
04:12:01.165 --> 04:12:04.905
and a translator will be live on a call to translate,

4663
04:12:05.045 --> 04:12:06.905
you know, for the families for the information.

4664
04:12:07.125 --> 04:12:10.585
So they can be used in like sssts conferences and whatnot.

4665
04:12:10.685 --> 04:12:14.605
Um, we also have um, contracts with um,

4666
04:12:14.875 --> 04:12:17.085
translation services for live translation

4667
04:12:17.145 --> 04:12:20.685
and multilingual staff of our staff that participate.

4668
04:12:20.985 --> 04:12:23.485
Um, live in meetings such as IEPs and whatnot.

4669
04:12:29.845 --> 04:12:30.945
So our findings

4670
04:12:31.005 --> 04:12:32.625
and next steps for goal five

4671
04:12:33.355 --> 04:12:35.825
would be we have increased our caregiver student

4672
04:12:36.305 --> 04:12:37.985
participation on district led committees.

4673
04:12:38.805 --> 04:12:40.865
It continues to be an area of focus to partner

4674
04:12:40.865 --> 04:12:42.105
with caregivers and students

4675
04:12:42.805 --> 04:12:45.385
and um, really to be intentional with that outreach

4676
04:12:45.605 --> 04:12:47.825
to listen to the experiences of our caregivers

4677
04:12:47.825 --> 04:12:50.625
and students so we can be responsive to them.

4678
04:12:56.815 --> 04:12:59.415
Questions, comments about goal five? Trustee

4679
04:12:59.415 --> 04:13:02.225
Blackman, thank you for presenting this.

4680
04:13:02.445 --> 04:13:04.705
Um, it's really important especially

4681
04:13:04.705 --> 04:13:07.185
because I think it addresses the other half

4682
04:13:07.185 --> 04:13:08.905
of our students' lives.

4683
04:13:08.955 --> 04:13:11.145
Their family and their family support is really important.

4684
04:13:11.805 --> 04:13:12.865
The first thing I'm going

4685
04:13:12.865 --> 04:13:14.305
to point out is something I have a personal

4686
04:13:14.305 --> 04:13:15.465
pet peeve in our community does.

4687
04:13:15.765 --> 04:13:17.545
Our parents are not caregivers, they're parents.

4688
04:13:17.765 --> 04:13:19.785
We need to make certain that we call 'em out as parents.

4689
04:13:20.215 --> 04:13:21.545
It's okay to have other names for them,

4690
04:13:21.645 --> 04:13:24.145
but I think they wanna, they wanna be recognized

4691
04:13:24.145 --> 04:13:26.505
and so to see them we need to use the terms

4692
04:13:26.505 --> 04:13:28.625
that they prefer being called.

4693
04:13:29.485 --> 04:13:32.025
And I think that's important. One of the things

4694
04:13:32.025 --> 04:13:35.185
that I wanna point out is that um, in terms

4695
04:13:35.185 --> 04:13:38.225
of family engagement, I know our numbers are kind of low,

4696
04:13:38.325 --> 04:13:40.185
but some of it is just um,

4697
04:13:41.415 --> 04:13:43.665
like when we tell parents we're gonna do parent teacher

4698
04:13:43.665 --> 04:13:44.985
conference and we give 'em 10 minutes

4699
04:13:44.985 --> 04:13:46.825
and a parent really feels like I just blasted through

4700
04:13:46.825 --> 04:13:48.385
and I don't really know what I'm expecting.

4701
04:13:48.385 --> 04:13:49.785
It's sort of like somebody give you a ticket

4702
04:13:49.785 --> 04:13:51.505
to go on a plane, you have no idea where you're going

4703
04:13:51.505 --> 04:13:54.305
and you're like, oh my gosh, I think it's a little too fast.

4704
04:13:54.725 --> 04:13:57.225
If we really recognize that parents are the other half

4705
04:13:57.245 --> 04:13:58.865
of the team working with helping

4706
04:13:58.885 --> 04:14:00.745
and supporting our students, we need

4707
04:14:00.745 --> 04:14:04.505
to engage them in a much more receptive way

4708
04:14:04.505 --> 04:14:06.385
that actually says, I hear you, I see you

4709
04:14:06.385 --> 04:14:07.465
and I wanna spend the time with you.

4710
04:14:08.125 --> 04:14:10.305
Um, a lot of our parents don't ever get to have

4711
04:14:10.305 --> 04:14:11.705
that engagement after the first parent

4712
04:14:11.705 --> 04:14:12.865
teacher conference and that's it.

4713
04:14:13.375 --> 04:14:16.625
Then we engage them in asking them to come on committees.

4714
04:14:17.085 --> 04:14:19.745
So if you don't have them interested in participating at

4715
04:14:19.745 --> 04:14:20.905
that parent teacher conference

4716
04:14:20.905 --> 04:14:22.145
or some event that's being thrown at

4717
04:14:22.145 --> 04:14:23.225
the school, they don't come back.

4718
04:14:23.775 --> 04:14:26.145
They're just out and they read the post and all that.

4719
04:14:26.145 --> 04:14:28.865
But I think if we wanna talk about engagement every time we

4720
04:14:28.865 --> 04:14:31.065
have a put in contact with a parent, we need to max it out,

4721
04:14:31.565 --> 04:14:32.825
really take advantage of it

4722
04:14:32.825 --> 04:14:34.465
to increase these engagement numbers.

4723
04:14:34.645 --> 04:14:37.145
So it's just a behavioral change.

4724
04:14:37.145 --> 04:14:39.905
And the reason why I mention is we lost a couple people this

4725
04:14:40.055 --> 04:14:41.385
past year to the district one went

4726
04:14:41.385 --> 04:14:42.425
to another school district where

4727
04:14:43.065 --> 04:14:46.385
whenever they have an issue, the staff are on it immediately

4728
04:14:46.805 --> 04:14:48.225
to the point where the responses

4729
04:14:48.245 --> 04:14:51.345
and the ability to clear it up happens almost within days,

4730
04:14:51.685 --> 04:14:53.025
if not by the next week.

4731
04:14:53.605 --> 04:14:55.825
And as a result it really feels like a point of service

4732
04:14:56.165 --> 04:15:00.265
and families we don't see it but they are our patrons.

4733
04:15:00.265 --> 04:15:02.105
Mm-Hmm. They essentially pay for the service

4734
04:15:02.965 --> 04:15:04.585
and if there was money being exchanged,

4735
04:15:04.585 --> 04:15:06.225
we would be maybe a little bit more aware of it.

4736
04:15:06.225 --> 04:15:09.260
But we need to be a little bit better at responding when an

4737
04:15:09.260 --> 04:15:11.645
issue comes up and not be so quick to deflect

4738
04:15:12.075 --> 04:15:13.685
that it's just not real to the parent.

4739
04:15:13.685 --> 04:15:15.925
It's real. And I understand we have our processes

4740
04:15:15.985 --> 04:15:18.165
but we have to be maybe a little bit better at being

4741
04:15:18.455 --> 04:15:20.325
responsive and acknowledging that we hear them.

4742
04:15:20.325 --> 04:15:21.445
We're gonna try and solve the issue.

4743
04:15:21.645 --> 04:15:22.685
'cause I'm finding some folks

4744
04:15:22.705 --> 04:15:24.205
who reports me they left the district

4745
04:15:24.205 --> 04:15:25.805
and they're really, really happy where they are

4746
04:15:25.805 --> 04:15:28.245
because the other district is very responsive

4747
04:15:28.745 --> 04:15:29.885
and I want that to get out.

4748
04:15:30.225 --> 04:15:32.045
So I think we can do a little bit of work on our part

4749
04:15:32.585 --> 04:15:35.085
In terms of the student surveys, um, one of the things

4750
04:15:35.085 --> 04:15:38.205
that I still look at as concerns is grade six through 12.

4751
04:15:38.825 --> 04:15:40.965
Um, even though the changes have been very minute,

4752
04:15:41.415 --> 04:15:43.965
we're still not seeing that that lovely bump,

4753
04:15:44.145 --> 04:15:45.565
it would be great to be in more like

4754
04:15:45.565 --> 04:15:46.965
70% once you feel better.

4755
04:15:47.125 --> 04:15:48.085
'cause that would align with some of

4756
04:15:48.085 --> 04:15:48.965
how we're doing with our grades.

4757
04:15:49.305 --> 04:15:50.325
And I think it goes back to

4758
04:15:50.325 --> 04:15:51.525
how students feel about learning.

4759
04:15:51.525 --> 04:15:54.195
They get stressed the intensity of our courses

4760
04:15:54.335 --> 04:15:57.315
and I've heard a lot from families who students have gone

4761
04:15:57.315 --> 04:15:59.955
to las disease or other places that they find

4762
04:15:59.955 --> 04:16:02.515
that the intensity, that thermostat goes down

4763
04:16:02.615 --> 04:16:04.315
and those courses and they feel like they can

4764
04:16:04.315 --> 04:16:05.635
achieve more and they feel better.

4765
04:16:06.335 --> 04:16:09.195
So I'd ask how do we actually reengage students

4766
04:16:09.195 --> 04:16:11.395
that they again go back to loving learning

4767
04:16:11.815 --> 04:16:13.675
and maybe these numbers change

4768
04:16:13.675 --> 04:16:15.155
because they have better confidence,

4769
04:16:15.155 --> 04:16:17.235
they feel like they have the grit to get things done.

4770
04:16:17.765 --> 04:16:19.875
Sorry. So those are my only comments. Thank you. Thank you.

4771
04:16:21.355 --> 04:16:22.795
I have just one question on the panorama.

4772
04:16:22.795 --> 04:16:24.275
What time of year do we do that?

4773
04:16:24.275 --> 04:16:27.395
Because I wonder if it would vary based on

4774
04:16:27.905 --> 04:16:28.835
Time of year. Time

4775
04:16:28.835 --> 04:16:31.035
Of year we heading towards finals and

4776
04:16:31.665 --> 04:16:34.275
Typically spring March I believe.

4777
04:16:34.705 --> 04:16:36.515
Okay. That's not too early, but it could be near

4778
04:16:36.515 --> 04:16:40.275
to Okay then I just wasn't sure if, I know different times

4779
04:16:40.275 --> 04:16:44.195
of year the stress levels and confidence levels kind of.

4780
04:16:45.215 --> 04:16:46.635
Um, we've talked as a team too.

4781
04:16:46.635 --> 04:16:50.515
Sometimes we might accidentally over survey families if a

4782
04:16:50.515 --> 04:16:53.515
site is doing it and ed services is doing it.

4783
04:16:53.935 --> 04:16:56.555
And um, I know like last year my LCAP one went

4784
04:16:56.555 --> 04:16:57.595
out as a separate one as well.

4785
04:16:57.895 --> 04:16:59.915
So we're really trying to tighten that up

4786
04:16:59.935 --> 04:17:01.595
and be more intentional of our timelines

4787
04:17:01.595 --> 04:17:04.035
and surveys so we're getting more accurate data.

4788
04:17:06.255 --> 04:17:09.685
Thank you. And I just real quick also, um, I know there,

4789
04:17:09.905 --> 04:17:11.725
you know, trustee Blackman has concerns about,

4790
04:17:11.855 --> 04:17:13.205
about parent not being used.

4791
04:17:13.525 --> 04:17:14.485
I say if you're gonna use parent,

4792
04:17:14.565 --> 04:17:15.485
I would use caregiver as well.

4793
04:17:15.605 --> 04:17:18.925
'cause there are definitely students in our, in our district

4794
04:17:19.545 --> 04:17:22.125
who are being raised by someone who is not a parent.

4795
04:17:22.185 --> 04:17:25.645
And so I think being inclusive of all families is important.

4796
04:17:25.945 --> 04:17:28.405
Um, so if you're gonna, I,

4797
04:17:28.485 --> 04:17:29.725
I wouldn't wanna go back to just parent.

4798
04:17:29.845 --> 04:17:31.005
I feel like it really defaults

4799
04:17:31.545 --> 04:17:33.645
and not seeing all of the people that

4800
04:17:33.645 --> 04:17:35.845
that raise our kids. Uh, trustee Blackman.

4801
04:17:36.395 --> 04:17:38.125
Yeah, I'll second that. I didn't mean to get rid

4802
04:17:38.125 --> 04:17:39.565
of caregiver, I just meant include parent.

4803
04:17:39.905 --> 04:17:40.965
So thank you for bringing that up.

4804
04:17:41.345 --> 04:17:44.045
Um, so the one question I had on Panorama survey,

4805
04:17:44.145 --> 04:17:46.165
you mentioned something I honed in on that you said

4806
04:17:46.165 --> 04:17:48.405
that the survey of the students was their

4807
04:17:48.405 --> 04:17:49.445
perception of themselves.

4808
04:17:50.565 --> 04:17:54.025
So usually when we look at data sets we go, there's a range

4809
04:17:54.025 --> 04:17:56.665
of accuracy of like, you know, maybe it's 5%, 10%,

4810
04:17:56.665 --> 04:17:59.305
but as you look at younger kids, do we know for certain

4811
04:17:59.305 --> 04:18:00.585
that they really understand

4812
04:18:00.655 --> 04:18:01.985
what it is that they're being asked?

4813
04:18:02.685 --> 04:18:04.585
Um, because you could actually show

4814
04:18:04.585 --> 04:18:06.945
that there's really a range, like it's within a 10 point

4815
04:18:07.015 --> 04:18:09.045
range of what we think it actually really is.

4816
04:18:09.945 --> 04:18:11.845
But I think Trustee Cherry mentioned that some

4817
04:18:11.845 --> 04:18:13.165
of the teachers are actually in the room

4818
04:18:13.165 --> 04:18:14.405
with the students the entire time.

4819
04:18:14.435 --> 04:18:16.005
They might actually have the ability

4820
04:18:16.065 --> 04:18:18.885
to provide additional layer of input for that student

4821
04:18:18.885 --> 04:18:20.285
where they see things like that.

4822
04:18:20.285 --> 04:18:24.125
They, a kid who is struggling with learning

4823
04:18:24.125 --> 04:18:27.565
to present in front of large groups maybe figures it out one

4824
04:18:27.565 --> 04:18:29.725
day presenting something they really like and they get it,

4825
04:18:29.785 --> 04:18:32.835
but they forget that like a month ago

4826
04:18:32.985 --> 04:18:34.035
they just were struggling.

4827
04:18:34.335 --> 04:18:36.155
So they don't necessarily recognize, oh,

4828
04:18:36.235 --> 04:18:37.635
I got the grit, I got it figured out.

4829
04:18:37.935 --> 04:18:40.275
So I'm just wondering if there's a little bit of like ways

4830
04:18:40.415 --> 04:18:42.795
to modify some of that a little bit maybe

4831
04:18:42.795 --> 04:18:46.535
with some teacher input to the information as opposed

4832
04:18:46.535 --> 04:18:47.815
to just make it purely student.

4833
04:18:49.225 --> 04:18:52.605
Um, we, um, the panorama is the platform that kind

4834
04:18:52.605 --> 04:18:53.645
of provides all that for us.

4835
04:18:53.835 --> 04:18:55.645
Okay. And so I've kind of taken it from that.

4836
04:18:56.095 --> 04:18:59.165
There is the K two survey, which is not reported on here.

4837
04:18:59.385 --> 04:19:01.525
The kindergarten through second grade teachers do

4838
04:19:01.525 --> 04:19:02.605
do perception of their students.

4839
04:19:02.825 --> 04:19:06.125
So they actually take the survey when they're at

4840
04:19:06.125 --> 04:19:07.605
what they perceive their students as.

4841
04:19:07.645 --> 04:19:09.645
I don't know if that's giving you the exact answer you want,

4842
04:19:09.645 --> 04:19:12.245
but that there, it is allowed for in that platform.

4843
04:19:13.435 --> 04:19:14.925
Okay. Thank you. I was just trying to make

4844
04:19:15.585 --> 04:19:17.605
the younger students actually there's a way to moderate it.

4845
04:19:17.605 --> 04:19:18.605
Thank you. Yeah,

4846
04:19:23.745 --> 04:19:24.745
We good. Do you wanna wrap us

4847
04:19:24.745 --> 04:19:26.405
up? I think we have one last slide

4848
04:19:26.405 --> 04:19:28.125
of our, I'm here our going forward.

4849
04:19:28.865 --> 04:19:32.485
Yes, I will. Okay. So that was all obviously.

4850
04:19:32.665 --> 04:19:36.245
Um, the final reporting of the data from that last lcap, um,

4851
04:19:36.865 --> 04:19:39.445
the board approved in June, our current 24

4852
04:19:39.445 --> 04:19:41.045
through 27 L cap lcap.

4853
04:19:41.505 --> 04:19:44.365
The goals are here. I'm not gonna read all of the goals.

4854
04:19:45.065 --> 04:19:46.645
Um, like I said, you voted on them,

4855
04:19:46.645 --> 04:19:47.925
we got 'em, you know, pretty recent.

4856
04:19:48.425 --> 04:19:49.485
Um, what I will say is

4857
04:19:49.485 --> 04:19:52.005
after looking at the data, we've identified these four goals

4858
04:19:52.065 --> 04:19:54.485
for our new lcap, which was previously adopted.

4859
04:19:54.705 --> 04:19:57.445
As I just said, the first two really center

4860
04:19:57.445 --> 04:20:00.445
around our academic program and success for all students.

4861
04:20:01.195 --> 04:20:04.005
Goal three is focused on our students' belonging

4862
04:20:04.085 --> 04:20:05.525
and family community engagement.

4863
04:20:06.105 --> 04:20:08.605
Lastly, goal four is the required goal focusing on

4864
04:20:08.605 --> 04:20:09.645
our Williams compliance.

4865
04:20:10.385 --> 04:20:12.805
Um, so I just wanted to point out when I say we have four

4866
04:20:12.855 --> 04:20:15.925
goals, we still kind of have those five areas that kind

4867
04:20:15.925 --> 04:20:17.605
of mirror what we just reported out.

4868
04:20:17.875 --> 04:20:19.885
Goal three is kind of a combination

4869
04:20:19.885 --> 04:20:22.845
of this past LCAPs goal three and five.

4870
04:20:22.985 --> 04:20:24.205
So we combined those there.

4871
04:20:24.205 --> 04:20:26.965
So I just wanted to show you that I'm really,

4872
04:20:27.525 --> 04:20:29.045
I just wanna thank you for your engagement

4873
04:20:29.045 --> 04:20:31.645
and thoughtful questions as it relates to last year's data.

4874
04:20:31.865 --> 04:20:36.565
You know, been a long program at a McKnight. Uh,

4875
04:20:36.565 --> 04:20:38.245
And I just have one more thing to say is that I know

4876
04:20:38.245 --> 04:20:41.655
that my introductory comments I praise

4877
04:20:41.755 --> 04:20:44.695
and commented on the, on the, on the ED services team.

4878
04:20:45.195 --> 04:20:46.975
But what you are looking at the booklet

4879
04:20:46.975 --> 04:20:49.175
that you are looking at, the multiple page booklet

4880
04:20:49.675 --> 04:20:51.655
and this presentation as the result

4881
04:20:51.675 --> 04:20:53.735
of Melissa West and her team.

4882
04:20:54.155 --> 04:20:56.735
So just, I'm very, uh, have deep gratitude

4883
04:20:56.735 --> 04:20:58.215
and thankful to Melissa

4884
04:20:58.315 --> 04:20:59.655
and her team for putting this together.

4885
04:20:59.985 --> 04:21:00.985
Thank you. Yeah,

4886
04:21:02.575 --> 04:21:06.045
Thank you for all of that good information and good depth

4887
04:21:06.225 --> 04:21:08.005
and thanks for getting it to us ahead of time

4888
04:21:08.005 --> 04:21:09.445
so we could kind of digest it.

4889
04:21:11.745 --> 04:21:15.165
Um, so we are approaching 10 o'clock, which is our cutoff

4890
04:21:15.165 --> 04:21:17.445
and we still have consent and a few other things.

4891
04:21:18.425 --> 04:21:20.725
Um, so I don't know if anyone wants to make a motion

4892
04:21:20.785 --> 04:21:23.515
to extend slightly.

4893
04:21:23.955 --> 04:21:26.835
I think we can pretty much go fairly quickly. I'm hoping

4894
04:21:26.935 --> 04:21:29.555
Can we just find out if there's items we pulled on consent

4895
04:21:29.555 --> 04:21:31.875
and then I'm happy to make a motion Sure. Based on that

4896
04:21:31.875 --> 04:21:32.875
Information. Um, yeah, consent

4897
04:21:32.875 --> 04:21:34.955
is L-M-N-O-N-P.

4898
04:21:36.485 --> 04:21:37.825
Is there anything that anyone wishes

4899
04:21:37.845 --> 04:21:39.465
to pull at this time? Trustee Blackman,

4900
04:21:40.305 --> 04:21:44.735
O one Poc.

4901
04:21:46.565 --> 04:21:48.645
Okay. Anything else?

4902
04:21:54.645 --> 04:21:56.855
Okay. I'll make a motion to approve the consent calendar.

4903
04:21:57.175 --> 04:21:59.855
LMNO and P minus oh one.

4904
04:22:02.315 --> 04:22:06.565
I'll second. All right. Motion Trustee Wan. Aye.

4905
04:22:06.845 --> 04:22:09.365
Everyone else? Aye. Aye. It carries.

4906
04:22:09.545 --> 04:22:13.005
Um, o which is our personnel document. A question on that.

4907
04:22:13.435 --> 04:22:14.565
Yeah, I wanna pull up,

4908
04:22:14.565 --> 04:22:16.525
because typically we have a lot, a bunch

4909
04:22:16.525 --> 04:22:18.805
of limited term assignments they're assigned.

4910
04:22:19.065 --> 04:22:21.645
Uh, they're titled as athletic coach winter season,

4911
04:22:22.115 --> 04:22:23.765
fall season, spring season, something like that.

4912
04:22:23.795 --> 04:22:25.325
Typically when we have these listed,

4913
04:22:25.345 --> 04:22:28.885
we actually denote the sport and whether it's a coach

4914
04:22:28.905 --> 04:22:30.085
or assistant coach, and

4915
04:22:30.265 --> 04:22:33.605
for some reason it's a very large list attached this time

4916
04:22:34.025 --> 04:22:36.325
and all of them are just athletic coach assigned

4917
04:22:36.345 --> 04:22:38.565
to one school to another all winter season.

4918
04:22:39.485 --> 04:22:42.055
Some of them are fall, but there's no specificity

4919
04:22:42.785 --> 04:22:45.125
and we've usually have specificity.

4920
04:22:45.185 --> 04:22:46.925
So can the list just be updated

4921
04:22:47.025 --> 04:22:48.045
and reposted so

4922
04:22:48.045 --> 04:22:50.005
that we can actually just know who is hired for what.

4923
04:22:50.185 --> 04:22:51.645
And the reason why I bring this up is

4924
04:22:51.645 --> 04:22:54.125
that there is a recent email message from, uh,

4925
04:22:54.125 --> 04:22:57.085
family members from Emerald High School requesting, um,

4926
04:22:57.325 --> 04:22:59.285
a coach for wrestling

4927
04:22:59.625 --> 04:23:01.525
and they've been told over the last year

4928
04:23:01.525 --> 04:23:02.725
and a half that they would have the ability

4929
04:23:02.725 --> 04:23:04.045
to offer wrestling.

4930
04:23:04.585 --> 04:23:06.245
But no, even though we've posted,

4931
04:23:06.665 --> 04:23:08.765
no one's actually come forward to apply for the position.

4932
04:23:08.785 --> 04:23:11.445
And so those students are left without a wrestling coach.

4933
04:23:11.545 --> 04:23:14.805
So it's just helpful during when we have these lists

4934
04:23:14.805 --> 04:23:18.925
that there's transparency as to which, um, sports are,

4935
04:23:19.465 --> 04:23:20.525
um, receiving coaches.

4936
04:23:20.905 --> 04:23:23.445
And so we know where we've got those gaps. Thank you.

4937
04:23:24.065 --> 04:23:27.245
So two things. One, the, the position has been posted.

4938
04:23:27.545 --> 04:23:29.765
Uh, the wrestling coaches have been posted since,

4939
04:23:30.025 --> 04:23:31.285
uh, the school's been opened.

4940
04:23:31.865 --> 04:23:36.445
Um, if in the past our coaches were defined by sport,

4941
04:23:36.745 --> 04:23:38.245
we will definitely update this one.

4942
04:23:38.465 --> 04:23:41.885
If they weren't moving forward, we'll be glad to, um,

4943
04:23:42.395 --> 04:23:44.485
list the sport that they're coaching. I, I they

4944
04:23:44.485 --> 04:23:46.125
Were, they've always been by sport, always.

4945
04:23:46.125 --> 04:23:47.765
Fantastic. Then we will correct this.

4946
04:23:47.865 --> 04:23:49.525
I'm not sure why there was a change this time.

4947
04:23:49.605 --> 04:23:51.565
I apologize for that. We will fix it.

4948
04:23:52.785 --> 04:23:54.375
Thank you. I'll make a motion then

4949
04:23:54.375 --> 04:23:56.135
that we approve item zero one.

4950
04:23:56.635 --> 04:24:00.125
Um, what's it call then? Here? Uh, personal action.

4951
04:24:00.635 --> 04:24:02.125
Personnel Action. Thank you.

4952
04:24:03.435 --> 04:24:07.865
I'll second Motion is second trustee Ani. Aye.

4953
04:24:08.185 --> 04:24:11.345
Everyone else? Aye. Aye, aye. All righty.

4954
04:24:11.485 --> 04:24:14.545
So we are on to, there are no written reports,

4955
04:24:15.565 --> 04:24:16.665
um, future items.

4956
04:24:19.065 --> 04:24:22.165
Um, anything to add at this point?

4957
04:24:23.705 --> 04:24:26.405
And governance. Cal, I'm sorry, I'll, I skipped forward.

4958
04:24:27.485 --> 04:24:29.085
I just had a question on the governance calendar.

4959
04:24:29.445 --> 04:24:32.165
I know January, typically there's a board retreat.

4960
04:24:32.165 --> 04:24:33.645
Is that something you're considering

4961
04:24:33.905 --> 04:24:35.045
as we look at the new board?

4962
04:24:36.105 --> 04:24:39.685
Uh, absolutely. So we will, uh, poll, um,

4963
04:24:40.635 --> 04:24:45.355
usually we bring the calendar forward, um, uh, prior

4964
04:24:45.455 --> 04:24:49.235
to, uh, the December 17th, just to make sure that there's no

4965
04:24:49.795 --> 04:24:51.275
conflicts with existing trustees,

4966
04:24:51.295 --> 04:24:54.235
but with two new people, I think we'll just have to wait

4967
04:24:54.375 --> 04:24:58.775
and bring the, uh, the new, um, we'll bring

4968
04:24:58.775 --> 04:24:59.895
that calendar on the 17th

4969
04:25:00.235 --> 04:25:01.535
and then the board will just have

4970
04:25:01.535 --> 04:25:03.495
to identify a date for the retreat.

4971
04:25:03.925 --> 04:25:04.925
Okay.

4972
04:25:07.305 --> 04:25:10.515
Okay. Then I'll go to Trustee Reports. Let's go quick.

4973
04:25:11.065 --> 04:25:12.635
Yeah, I think we each get one minute.

4974
04:25:12.975 --> 04:25:16.835
Um, I was able to attend the Frederickson Veterans Day, um,

4975
04:25:18.145 --> 04:25:20.875
celebration and program, uh, last Friday,

4976
04:25:20.885 --> 04:25:22.275
which was great as usual.

4977
04:25:22.895 --> 04:25:24.955
Um, I also attended the, uh,

4978
04:25:24.955 --> 04:25:26.875
drama production Best Man at Dublin High,

4979
04:25:26.975 --> 04:25:28.275
and they did a fabulous job.

4980
04:25:28.895 --> 04:25:30.475
And finally the Saturday

4981
04:25:30.575 --> 04:25:32.875
before, um, Dublin High School, um,

4982
04:25:33.055 --> 04:25:34.435
hosted the Dublin Invitational.

4983
04:25:34.975 --> 04:25:37.275
Um, and we had a number of great bands

4984
04:25:37.275 --> 04:25:38.475
that came and performed.

4985
04:25:38.655 --> 04:25:40.595
It was great to see so much energy on campus.

4986
04:25:41.375 --> 04:25:44.915
Um, and again, the, the band is the Dublin Irish Guard,

4987
04:25:45.015 --> 04:25:46.075
not the Dublin High School.

4988
04:25:46.295 --> 04:25:47.675
Um, and continue to have more

4989
04:25:47.675 --> 04:25:48.995
and more Emerald students a part of it

4990
04:25:48.995 --> 04:25:51.195
and great collaboration in our district

4991
04:25:51.195 --> 04:25:52.795
of both high schools for that band.

4992
04:25:53.005 --> 04:25:54.005
Thank you.

4993
04:25:55.725 --> 04:25:58.655
Nothing to report. Thank, No

4994
04:25:58.655 --> 04:25:59.655
Report.

4995
04:26:00.025 --> 04:26:04.085
No report. Oh, say I I also attended the, the play.

4996
04:26:04.345 --> 04:26:06.605
Um, it was wonderful.

4997
04:26:07.225 --> 04:26:09.845
Um, and I also had an opportunity to attend, um,

4998
04:26:10.225 --> 04:26:13.005
the family service for, um, Caitlyn Rapine.

4999
04:26:13.585 --> 04:26:17.005
Um, and so that was a very lovely student family center.

5000
04:26:17.445 --> 04:26:18.965
I felt like it was, it was very well done

5001
04:26:18.985 --> 04:26:19.885
and a good time for the

5002
04:26:19.885 --> 04:26:21.125
community to kind of just come together.

5003
04:26:21.945 --> 04:26:26.245
Um, and I, I wanna applaud, um, principal Wisack, um,

5004
04:26:26.585 --> 04:26:29.415
and I'm forgetting Erin's last name,

5005
04:26:29.435 --> 04:26:33.415
but the assistant principal, Miguel, thank you, um,

5006
04:26:34.435 --> 04:26:39.055
for their intention of it being very student centered and,

5007
04:26:39.115 --> 04:26:41.815
and allowing students space, um, there

5008
04:26:41.815 --> 04:26:43.215
and then also for the adults as well.

5009
04:26:43.275 --> 04:26:45.495
But I, I really appreciated at the elementary level

5010
04:26:45.605 --> 04:26:47.055
that the care that was taken so,

5011
04:26:48.275 --> 04:26:49.615
um, was able to attend that.

5012
04:26:49.915 --> 04:26:54.855
Um, and that is pretty much what I have. I'll pass. Okay.

5013
04:26:55.075 --> 04:26:57.255
Um, trustee Blackman? Sorry. Can

5014
04:26:57.255 --> 04:26:59.455
I revert back to items, new items?

5015
04:27:00.035 --> 04:27:01.035
Uh,

5016
04:27:01.835 --> 04:27:04.295
Uh, I don't know that we're gonna have time.

5017
04:27:04.755 --> 04:27:08.335
No, just one quick request. Okay. Um, superintendent Funk.

5018
04:27:08.655 --> 04:27:10.615
I know that there are budget discussions

5019
04:27:10.615 --> 04:27:13.295
and meetings coming up leading towards the decision in

5020
04:27:13.535 --> 04:27:16.015
February, but there's been a change in the federal

5021
04:27:16.015 --> 04:27:17.455
administration that will occur in January.

5022
04:27:18.155 --> 04:27:19.495
And I would ask you

5023
04:27:19.595 --> 04:27:22.615
and your team to evaluate our current budget against any

5024
04:27:22.615 --> 04:27:24.895
future cuts that may occur that have been announced

5025
04:27:24.915 --> 04:27:28.495
by the new Federal administration so that we could be aware

5026
04:27:28.495 --> 04:27:30.735
of what issues we may be facing

5027
04:27:31.315 --> 04:27:32.735
before those budget meetings occur.

5028
04:27:32.735 --> 04:27:33.735
Thank you.

5029
04:27:37.515 --> 04:27:39.805
Okay. Um, if there's nothing else, I

5030
04:27:40.675 --> 04:27:43.805
will take a motion to adjourn. I'll move we adjourn.

5031
04:27:43.985 --> 04:27:45.525
Second. All in favor?

5032
04:27:46.265 --> 04:27:47.565
Aye. Aye. All righty.

5033
04:27:47.565 --> 04:27:50.005
Our next meeting will be a very brief meeting on

5034
04:27:50.205 --> 04:27:52.845
December 3rd with one item to discuss the

5035
04:27:53.655 --> 04:27:54.965
first interim budget.

5036
04:27:56.125 --> 04:27:58.795
First interim budget, and then our regular meeting will be

5037
04:27:58.815 --> 04:28:01.155
the, um, December 17th meeting. So just,

5038
04:28:01.155 --> 04:28:04.115
And the, um, meeting on the third is the six

5039
04:28:04.115 --> 04:28:05.955
o'clock I assume?

5040
04:28:06.495 --> 04:28:11.375
Yes, I think so. Six o'clock six our usual time.

5041
04:28:11.685 --> 04:28:13.975

04:28:20.625 --> 04:28:21.985
Board, which may or may not have it closed

5046
04:28:22.695 --> 04:28:24.265
depending on what's going on.
