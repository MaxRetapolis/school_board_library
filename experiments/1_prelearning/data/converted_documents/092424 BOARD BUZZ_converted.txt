textbooks or instructional materials, or both, aligned to the state-adopted content standards in mathematics, science, history-social science, and English 
language arts. As part of the public hearing, the governing board is also required to determine whether each student enrolled in a world language or health 
course has sufficient textbooks or instructional materials consistent with the state-adopted frameworks for those subjects. Notice of this public hearing 
was posted at least ten days before the hearing as required by state statute. After the public hearing, the board is expected to adopt a resolution indicating 
whether each student has sufficient textbooks or instructional materials as speciﬁed in California Education Code Section 60119.

ITEM G1 : Resolution 2024-25-10, Supporting Proposition 2: Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public 
Education Facilities Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024 
In November 2024, the general election ballot will include Proposition 2, The Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public  
Education Facilities Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024. Proposition 2 would provide $8.5 billion to K-12 schools and $1.5 billion to  
community colleges to renovate, ﬁx and construct facilities. The money would be distributed through matching grants, with the state paying a greater  
share of costs for less affluent districts and those with higher numbers of English learners and foster youth. Some of the money would be set aside for  
removing lead from water, creating transitional kindergarten classrooms and building career and technical education facilities.

speciﬁc sexual health topics at least once in grades 7-8 and again in grades 9-12, with an option for sexual health topics to be introduced in an
