2024
DUSD
Community,
Earlier
this
week,
we
held
our
ﬁrst
two
Town
Hall
Budget
Meetings
designed
to
address
the
ﬁscal 
challenges
we
anticipate
for
the
2025-2026
school
year.
As
most
know,
DUSD
implemented 
approximately
$4M
in
budget
cuts
last
year
to
address
our
ﬁnancial
needs
for
the
2024-2025
school 
year.
These
were
some
of
the
ﬁrst
signiﬁcant
cuts
the
district
has
made
after
nearly
20
years
of 
consistent
and,
in
many
cases,
exceptional
growth.
I
wish
last
year's
cuts
were
all
we
needed,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
To
continue
our
move
away
from 
deﬁcit
spending
towards
a
more
balanced
budget
while
at
the
same
time
maintaining
mandated 
reserves,
we
estimate
the
need
to
reduce
our
expenditures
by
approximately
$5.5M
next
year.
Your
participation
is
crucial
because
any
cuts
of
this
size
will
impact
our
programs
and
services. 
These
meetings
allow
you
to
better
understand
how
we
are
funded,
what
funding
sources
we
can 
and
cannot
use
to
address
our
challenges,
where
we
have
already
made
cuts,
and
where
we
see 
potential
opportunities
to
reduce
expenditures
further.
We
have
identiﬁed
over
$11M
in
areas
that
could
offer
savings.
Of
that
$11M,
we
need
to
determine 
what
$5.5M
are
the
cuts
our
community
will
be
most
comfortable
with.
This
is
a
multi-month
process,
resulting
in
recommendations
being
presented
to
the
Board
early 
next
year.
VIRTUAL
TOWN
HALL
MONDAY,
OCTOBER
7
@
6:30 
Our
next
Town
Hall
meeting
is
scheduled
for
October
7
and
will
be
held
online
(see
details
below). 
This
allows
more
people
to
learn,
participate,
and
provide
input.
Your
participation
in
this
event
is 
crucial,
and
we
encourage
you
to
attend
so
your
voice
is
heard.
I
also
want
to
encourage
everyone
to
learn
more
about
the
Dublin
Education
Alliance
.
All
our 
neighboring
districts
have
an
organization
of
this
nature,
which
raises
funds
to
address
shortfalls 
and
support
critical
educational
initiatives
in
their
district.

Electric
Scooter
Issue:
Some
students
use
electric
scooters
to
travel
to
and
from
school,
and
we
understand 
that
these
can
be
a
convenient
mode
of
transportation.
It's
important
to
note
that
based
on
a
review
of 
California
law,
many
of
our
students
are
using
electric
scooters
illegally.
California
law
requires
anyone 
operating
an
electric
scooter
to
have
an
instructional
permit
or
driver's
license.
The
minimum
age
for
an 
instructional
permit
in
California
is
15
1/2,
meaning
no
elementary
or
middle
school
students
can
legally 
operate
an
electric
scooter
on
our
streets/roads.
For
those
who
are
at
least
15
1/2
years
old
and
in
possession 
of
an
instructional
permit
or
driver's
license,
it
is
illegal
to
operate
an
electric
scooter
on
the
sidewalk
and 
anyone
under
the
age
of
18
must
be
wearing
a
helmet.

In
just
the
ﬁrst
few
weeks
of
this
school
year,
1,369
students
across
the

With
many
more

to
be

a

this
effort
ensures
early

2024-2025
DUSD
Budget
Book
Available:
Every
June,
school
boards
across
the
state
are
required
to
adopt 
budgets
for
the
upcoming
ﬁscal
year.
While
the
state-mandated
documents
are
thorough,
they
can
be 
di cult
to
interpret
and
often
lack
context
for
the
decisions
behind
the
numbers.
At
Dublin
Uniﬁed,
we 
believe
that
a
budget
is
more
than
just
numbers—it's
a
blueprint
for
achieving
the
district's
vision
and
goals. 
To
better
communicate
this,
we've
created
an
award-winning
budget
book
that
goes
beyond
the
ﬁgures
to 
explain
what
our
budget
aims
to
achieve.
We're
excited
to
share
the
2024-2025
Budget
Book
with
our 
community,
and
we
encourage
everyone
to
use
this
resource
to
understand
how
we
use
our
ﬁnancial 
resources
to
support
our
students.
