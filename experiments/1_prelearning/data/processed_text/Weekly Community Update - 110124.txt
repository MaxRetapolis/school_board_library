DUSD
Community,
While
our
students
enjoyed
a
well-deserved
day
off
today,
our
staff
were
fully
engaged
in
a 
professional
development
day
dedicated
to
strengthening
the
educational
experience
for
every 
student
in
our
district.
Our
educators
and
support
staff
had
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
approximately
55
learning 
sessions
focused
on
a
wide
range
of
important
topics,
including
inclusion
and
belonging, 
instructional
strategies,
and
positive
behavior
supports
for
our
certiﬁcated
staff.
Additionally, 
we’ve
planned
numerous
specialized
sessions
for
our
classiﬁed
staff,
tailored
to
meet
the
needs
of 
our
SPED
instructional
aides,
custodians,
media
technicians,
secretaries,
campus
supervisors,
and 
more.
Creating
a
vibrant,
supportive
learning
environment
is
essential
to
the
success
of
our
schools.
By 
investing
in
professional
development,
we’re
equipping
our
dedicated
team
with
the
tools
and 
strategies
they
need
to
support
every
student
effectively.
These
sessions
not
only
build
skills
but 
also
foster
a
culture
of
lifelong
learning—a
value
we
hold
close
for
both
our
students
and
staff.
Thank
you
for
your
support
in
recognizing
the
importance
of
these
days,
which
contribute
to
a
more 
enriching,
inclusive,
and
effective
learning
environment
for
everyone.
Sincerely,
