2024
DUSD
Community,
This
week
we
successfully
launched
the
2024-2025
school
year,
with
all
14
of
our
schools
opening
their
doors 
without
a
hitch.
We
welcomed
nearly
13,000
students
and
approximately
1,200
staff
members
back
to
our 
campuses.
The
energy
and
enthusiasm
I
experienced
across
the
district
has
set
a
positive
tone
for
the
year 
ahead.
This
year
is
especially
momentous
as
we
celebrate
the
historic
opening
of
our
second
comprehensive
high 
school,
Emerald
High.
The
addition
of
this
beautiful
new
campus
marks
a
signiﬁcant
milestone
for
our 
district
and
reﬂects
our
ongoing
commitment
to
providing
exceptional
educational
opportunities
for
all 
students
and
meeting
the
needs
of
our
growing
community.
I
want
to
extend
my
heartfelt
thanks
to
every
member
of
our
team
who
worked
tirelessly
to
ensure
a
smooth 
and
successful
start
to
the
school
year.
Your
dedication
and
hard
work
are
truly
appreciated.
As
we
move
forward,
I
am
ﬁlled
with
excitement
for
the
learning,
growth,
and
achievements
that
await
us.
Thank
you
for
your
continued
support
and
partnership.
Sincerely,
Chris

Citizens'

2021-2022
and
2022-2023
Reports:
During
the
August
13,
2024
Board
Meeting,
the 
Independent
Citizens'
Bond
Oversight
Committee
(CBOC)
submitted
its
2021-2022
and
2022-2023
Annual
Reports
to
the 
Board
of
Trustees.
Due
to
committee
membership
turnover,
the
2021-2022
report
had
not
been
presented
to
the
Board, 
so
both
reports
were
presented
simultaneously.
The
purpose
of
the
CBOC
is
to
inform
the
public
and
the
Board
regarding 
expenditures
of
bond
funds
pursuant
to
Education
Code
Section
15278.
In
order
to
notify
the
community
of
the
availability 
of
the
reports,
the
CBOC
will
post
ﬂyers
with
QR
code
links
in
community
facilities
such
as
City
Hall,
the
library,
The
Wave, 
and
the
Senior
Center.

COVID
CASES
RISING:
Alameda
County
is
seeing
an
uptick
in
COVID+
cases.
It
is
important
to
practice
preventative 
measures
to
mitigate
the
spread
of
COVID
and
other
respiratory
illnesses
including:
●
Cover
your
mouth
and
nose
with
a
tissue
when
you
cough
or
sneeze
.
Throw
used
tissues
in
the
trash.
If
you 
don't
have
a
tissue,
cough
or
sneeze
into
your
elbow,
not
your
hands.
●
Learn
and
use
proper
handwashing
techniques
.
●
Teach
children
the
correct
way
to
wash
their
hands.

symptoms
are
mild/improving.
It
is
recommended
to
wear
a
mask
for
10
days
