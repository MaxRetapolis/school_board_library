Community,
As
we
approach
the
end
of
summer,
I
hope
you
have
all
had
a
restful
and
enjoyable
break
with
your
friends
and 
family.
With
the
new
school
year
just
over
two
weeks
away,
I
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
remind
everyone 
to
start
preparing
for
the
upcoming
academic
year.
Our
dedicated
staff
has
been
working
diligently
to
ensure
that
our
schools
are
ready
to
welcome
back
our 
students
in
a
safe
and
supportive
environment.
We
are
committed
to
providing
the
best
possible
educational 
experience
for
all
students,
and
we
are
looking
forward
to
the
exciting
year
ahead.
I
encourage
you
to
take
some
time
to
review
important
dates,
gather
school
supplies,
and
make
any 
necessary
preparations
to
help
ensure
a
smooth
transition
into
the
new
school
year.
Below,
you’ll

to 
notes
each

our
schools
have

success
of
our

grateful

continued

always,
we

well-being
and
success
of
our
students,
and 
we
look
forward
to
working
together
