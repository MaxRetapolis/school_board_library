BACKGROUND:
The Independent Citizens' Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) is submitting the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 
Annual Reports to the Board of Trustees. Due to committee membership turnover, the 2021-2022 report has 
not been presented to the Board and both reports are being presented simultaneously. The purpose of the 
CBOC is to inform the public and the Board regarding expenditures of bond funds pursuant to Education Code 
Section 15278. In order to notify the community of the availability of the reports, the CBOC has decided to 
post flyers with QR code links in all community facilities such as City Hall, the library, The Wave, and the 
Senior Center. Messages will be sent out through District communication channels to families, and CBOC 

Page 10:
members will post on local social media platforms as well. In addition, District Communications staff will add 
information regarding the availability of the reports to the District website, issue a press release to the local 
media, and route to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Presenting the reports is the current CBOC Chair, 
Seema Badar.

Subject : 1. First Reading - Revisions to Board Bylaw (BB) 9220, 
Governing Board Elections
Meeting : Aug 13, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Discussion, Information
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
At its July 2, 2024 Special Board Meeting, the Board took action to adjust the district's contribution toward the 
cost of printing, handling, translating, mailing, and/or electronically distributing candidate statements filed 

Page 12:
for those Dublin residents who have filed their candidacy for a seat on the pursuant to Elections Code 13307
DUSD governing board. The amount was increased from $500 per candidate to not exceed $800 per 
candidate. As such, staff has prepared a draft of a revised Board Bylaw 9220 to reflect this change.
In addition, CSBA recently issued updated policy language to reflect new law (AB 764, 2023), also known as 
the Fair And Inclusive Redistricting for Municipalities And Political Subdivisions (FAIR MAPS) Act, which 
establishes a comprehensive set of rules that local governments, including school districts, must follow during 
the redistricting process. In addition, the updated bylaw language references a new Exhibit (1), which includes 
a non-exhaustive list of offenses the conviction of which makes someone ineligible to be a school board 
member. The bylaw language has also been updated for clarity, precision, organization, and consistency.
This is a first reading. It is anticipated that the bylaw will be brought to the Board for a second reading and 
approval at the August 27, 2024 board meeting.

9223, Filling Vacancies
Meeting : Aug 13, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of

Type : Discussion, Information
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
CSBA recently issued updated policy language for Bylaw 9223, Filling Vacancies, to reflect new law (AB 1326, 
2023), which requires that the notice of a provisional appointment be posted on the district's website. 
Additionally, the bylaw language has been updated to (1) focus on filling a vacancy by appointment rather than 
special election, (2) enable the Governing Board to approve, by resolution, the procedures for selecting the 
person to be provisionally appointed to fill the vacancy, and (3) explain how long an appointed Board member 
may serve. In addition, the bylaw has been updated for clarity, precision, organization, and consistency.
This is a first reading. It is anticipated that the bylaw will be brought to the Board for a second reading and 
approval at the August 27, 2024 board meeting.

Meeting : Aug 13, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Discussion
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
Dublin Unified School District acknowledges that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool for 
students and staff. Currently, the District lacks a policy for the acceptable use of AI within the classroom or the 
workplace. Over the past eight months, the AI Committee, a sub-committee of the Technology Advisory 
Committee, has been working towards guidelines and policy recommendations for AI use within the District. 
The board policy and administrative regulation promote both AI literacy and the regulation of AI within the 
Dublin Unified School District.

Finding No Further Environmental Review Is Required for 
the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School Pursuant to Public 
Resources Code Section 21166 Under the California 
Environmental Quality Act
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
The Dublin Crossing Specific Plan originally consisted of the demolition of existing dwellings and other site 
improvements, and the construction of a residential mixed-use development with up to 1,995 single and multi-
family residential units; up to 200,000 square feet of retail, office and/or commercial uses; a 30-acre 
community park and a five-acre neighborhood park (Project). The Project also included a 12-acre school site 
to serve up to 900 kindergarten through 5th grade students (Original School Project).
On November 5, 2013, the City of Dublin (City) approved the Project, which included the Original School 
Project, and adopted Resolution No. 186-13 certifying the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan Final Environmental 
Impact Report (EIR) for the Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2012062009) in compliance with the California 
Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code 
Regs., § 15000 et seq.) (CEQA).
In connection with the consideration and adoption of the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan and EIR, a Statement 
of Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations (SOC), a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program 
(MMRP), were also adopted. The District was notified by the City pursuant to all applicable CEQA provisions 
during the environmental review process conducted for the EIR and reviewed and commented on the EIR. 
Further, the previously certified EIR evaluated and mitigated the impacts of the Original School Project with 
the anticipated development of the Dublin Crossing Specific Plan.
The District has now determined that the Dublin Crossing community would be better served by siting a TK-8 
school, to be named the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School, in the Project area rather than the originally proposed K-
5 school and expanding the number of students from 900 to 1,054 (Revised School Project). The Revised 
School Project would be located on the same 12-acre location as the Original School Project.
Public Resources Code section 21166 requires that when an environmental impact report has been prepared 
for a project, no subsequent or supplemental environmental impact report shall be required by the lead agency 
or by any responsible agency, unless one or more of the following events occur:
Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the
environmental impact report;
Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being
undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental impact report;
New information, which was not known and could not have been known at the time the
environmental impact report was certified as complete, becomes available.
None of the above events apply to the Revised School Project, and the addition of 154 students are
considered minor. School additions are considered minor when the addition would increase capacity by
less than 25% or 10 classrooms. (CEQA Guidelines, section 15314.) The Original School Project was for
900 students and the Revised School Project is designed for capacity of 1,054 students. This will only

Page 21:
increase student capacity by 17.1%, with a corresponding increase of 6 classrooms. Further, the District
commissioned a Transportation Impact Study which also found that the increase of 154 students would not
cause any significant impacts to traffic or transportation.
Accordingly, based on the above: 1) the Revised School Project is not proposing substantial changes to
the Project and will not require any revisions to the EIR; 2) there are no substantial changes with respect to
the circumstances under which the Project is being undertaken, and 3) there is no new information of
substantial importance.
Should the Board adopt the Resolution, the Board will have determined that the revisions to the Original
School Project will not require revisions to the EIR because none of the conditions in Public Resources
Code section 21166 are applicable, and the CEQA requirements for the Revised School Project will have
been fulfilled.

Public Content
BACKGROUND:
CSBA's recommended policy language has been updated to clarify that a study session, retreat, public forum, 
or discussion meeting of the Governing Board must either be held as a regular or special Board meeting. 
Additionally, the language has been updated to reflect new law (AB 557, 2023) which extended and modified 
the ability of a Board member to join a meeting by teleconference due to just cause or emergency 
circumstances or during a proclaimed state of emergency. Additional updates include the removal of outdated 
COVID-19 related requirements, and changes made to improve clarity, precision, organization, and 
consistency.
The Board conducted its first reading of the revisions on May 28, 2024, and had a second reading on June 11, 
2024. The second reading prompted a request for clarification regarding the language addressing board 
members' remote participation in board meetings. Further review of the recommended revisions by staff and 
legal counsel has resulted in the addition of clarifying language and a section of text that was previously 
inadvertently omitted. These recent changes appear in blue highlight on the attached redline document. Board 
approval is now sought for therevised bylaw.

provides the California Commission on Teacher Credential (CTC) with the CALPADS assignment data, which 
the CTC compares against their credential authorization data as part of the annual assignment monitoring 
process conducted through the California Statewide Assignment Accountability System (CalSAAS).
This process evaluates each assignment based on the Statewide Educator Identification (SEID) associated 
with the assignment to determine if or how the teacher is authorized to teach the assigned course and the 
students enrolled in the course. The ineffective and out-of-field statuses included in this report reflect teacher 
definitions for the California Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Consolidated State Plan approved by the 
State Board of Education (SBE) in November 2019. The numbers and percentages reflected in the report 
represent the sum of the FTE by AMO for the classroom-based assignments selected level and/or entity.

BACKGROUND:
ELOP funds offer expanded learning opportunities to Dublin Unified School District unduplicated (English 
Learner, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and Foster Youth) students before and after school, intersession, 
and summer.
ELOP is derived from Assembly Bill (AB) 130, which offers academic, enrichment, and social-emotional 
development activities. Expanded Learning means before-school, after-school, summer, or intersession 
programs that focus on developing pupils' academic, social, emotional, and physical needs and interests 
through hands-on, engaging learning experiences. The Legislature intends that expanded learning programs 
are pupil-centered and results-driven, include community partners, and complement, but do not replicate, 
learning activities in the regular school day and school year.
Entitlement funds are based on the district's annual unduplicated TK-6 students (1662 in the 2024-25 
school year)
DUSD's entitlement: $1.8 million for the 2024-2025 school year
50% of our unduplicated TK-6 students must be enrolled in the programs
Note: Who is an unduplicated pupil? A pupil enrolled in a school district or a charter school classified as an 
English Learner, eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, or foster youth.
The ELOP continues to be implemented as indicated in the following timeline:

build delivery method for bond project construction with standard contract form for preconstruction services, 
facility leases and site leases were approved, as well as, a best-value scoring and evaluation method to be 
used to create a pool of qualified prime contractors and selection for the best value prime for individual bond 
projects.
On December 15, 2021, the District advertised a Request for Qualifications RFQ 21/22-108 (RFQ) for prime 
contractors experienced in K-12 school construction using lease-leaseback or design-build delivery methods.
On January 24, 2022, the District received twenty-two (22) proposals for evaluation. Using a best-value 
scoring methodology, staff reviewed and scored each proposal against the criteria set forth in the RFQ to 
determine a pool of qualified prime contractors (hereinafter pool). The RFQ stipulated a minimum score of 700 
out of 920 for inclusion into the pool. Nineteen (19) responsive prime contractors qualified for inclusion into the 
pool.
On April 11, 2022, the District sent out a Request for Proposals (RFP 21/22-116 herein after RFP) to members 
of the pool for the Murray Elementary Phase 2 (Multi-Purpose Room/Administration) bond project using the 
lease-leaseback delivery method. Six (6) qualified bidders from the pool attended a non-mandatory site walk 
on April 18, 2022. Questions from primes regarding the RFP were received on April 22, 2022 and fully 
answered on April 29, 2022 by the District. Nine (9) proposals were received by the due date of May 9, 2022.
Using a best-value scoring methodology, staff reviewed and scored each proposal against the criteria set forth 
in the RFP. Four (4) prime contractors received scores above 250 out of 500 total points and were asked to 
attend an oral interview held on May 18, 2022 and May 20, 2022. The Interview Committee, comprised of 
District Staff, Project Architect, and Project DSA Inspector, interviewed and rated each prime contractors oral 
interview. Roebbelen Construction, Inc., had the highest final combined proposal and interview scores 
resulting in the best value evaluation.
On June 14, 2022, the Board approved Roebbelen Construction, Inc. as the prime contractor for the Murray 
Elementary Phase II (Multi-Purpose/Administration Bldg.) Project and approval of their contract for 
preconstruction services.
On October 10, 2023, the Board of Trustees (Board) approved the additional funding for the Murray 
Elementary Modernization in the amount of $6,800,000.00. This will add Phase III to the modernization project

BACKGROUND:
Governor Newsom signed the 2024/2025 Budget Act, along with SB153 (the K-12 education omnibus budget 
trailer bill), on June 29, 2024. Per Education Code 42127(h), "Not later than 45 days after the Governor signs 
the annual Budget Act, the school district shall make available for public review any revisions in revenues and 
expenditures that it has made to its budget to reflect the funding made available by that Budget Act."
As there were no material changes to the state education budget, as compared with the Governor's May 
Revision, staff is not presenting any revisions in revenues and expenditures from the budget adopted by the 
Board of Trustees at its June 11 meeting. The next required presentation of the budget will be at the First 
Interim reporting period in December.
