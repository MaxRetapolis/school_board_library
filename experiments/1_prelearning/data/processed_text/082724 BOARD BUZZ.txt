In August 2024, an update on Transitional Kindergarten (TK) was shared with the Board of Trustees. As the TK eligibility expands, we  
continue to enroll more TK-aged students. The presentation shares our current enrollment numbers for TK, Kindergarten, and the  
district-wide enrollment broken down by school and grade level. The projected numbers detail the TK and Kindergarten enrollment over the  
next few years and the increased enrollment's impact on facilities and programming.
