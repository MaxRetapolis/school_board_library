ITEM F1 : First Reading - New BP and AR 5131.8, Mobile Communication Devices 
DUSD staff is bringing the Mobile Communication Devices BP/AR to the DUSD Board of Trustees for their review and consideration.  
Numerous studies continue to show that mobile communication device use in the classroom interferes with a student’s education and  
lowers student performance. The use of these devices is detrimental to students’ mental health and social skills by promoting cyberbullying  
and increasing levels of student anxiety, depression, and suicide. Ed Code Section 48901.7 authorizes the governing board to regulate the  
student's use of phones, smartphones, and any other electronic devices in the classroom. Previously, this has been left to the site  
administrator's discretion. BP and AR 5131.8, Mobile Communication Devices will create guidelines on student phone use for the district as  a 
whole. The drafted policy has been developed in conjunction with the District Technology Committee, utilizing CSBA recommended  
language. The policy has also been reviewed by the Superintendent's Cabinet, which includes school principals and DTA representation.  
Input from these stakeholders has also been incorporated into the documents. The policy and regulation are being presented for a ﬁrst  
reading; it is anticipated that approval for the policy will be sought at an upcoming board meeting. Approval for the regulation is not  
required.

ITEM G1 : First Reading - Revision of Multiple BPs/ARs related to Title IX 
It is good governance practice for districts to regularly review and update Board Policies (BPs) and Administrative Regulations (ARs) to 
reﬂect current laws and local practices. 
In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released revised regulations that support the implementation of Title IX, a federal law 
prohibiting sex discrimination in publicly funded education programs and activities. As part of the ongoing effort to update the board policy 
manual, Human Resources has identiﬁed needed updates to the various policies and regulations that are related to and supportive of the 
mandate. 
What is Title IX? 
Title IX is a federal law that was passed in 1972 to protect students and employees in educational settings from sex discrimination. It applies 
to anyone, regardless of their gender identity, sex, or gender expression, and protects against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, 
sexual orientation, and sex characteristics. Title IX also protects against sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances, 
requests for sexual favors, and sexual violence. 
The attached "Title IX Board Policies Update" highlights the key updates and essential highlights of the policies and procedures being 
brought to the Board for consideration. 
In total, ten BP/ARs will be updated, based on CSBA recommendations, due to the new 2024 Title IX regulations. 
New Board Policies/Administrative Regulations: 
● AR 4119.13/4219.13/4319.13: 2024 Title IX Sex Discrimination Grievance Procedures (Staff) 
● AR 5145.72: 2024 Title IX Sex Discrimination Grievance Procedures (Students) 
Updated Board Policies/Administrative Regulations: 
● BP 0410: Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities 
● BP/AR 1312.3: Uniform Complaint Procedures 
● BP/AR 4030: Nondiscrimination in Employment 
● BP 4033: Lactation Accommodation 
● BP/AR 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment 
● BP/AR 5145.3: Nondiscrimination/Harassment 
● BP/AR 5145.7: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment (retitled) 
● BP 5146: Married/Pregnant/Parenting Students 
These are presented for a ﬁrst reading. It is anticipated that the policies will be brought to the next board meeting for a second reading and 
adoption.
