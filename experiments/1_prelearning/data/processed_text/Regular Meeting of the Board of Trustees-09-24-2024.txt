BACKGROUND:
In November 2024, the general election ballot will include Proposition 2, The Kindergarten Through Grade 12

of 2024. Proposition 2would provide $8.5 billion to K-12 schools and $1.5 billion to community colleges to 
renovate, fix and construct facilities. The money would be distributed through matching grants, with the state 
paying a greater share of costs for less affluent districts and those with higher numbers of English learners 
and foster youth. Some of the money would be set aside for removing lead from water, creating transitional 
kindergarten classrooms and building career and technical education facilities.

OPERATIONAL ITEMS/BOARD DISCUSSION AND/OR 
ACTION
Subject : 2. First Reading - Revisions to Board Bylaw (BB) 
9323.2, Actions by the Board, and accompanying Exhibit
Meeting : Sep 24, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of Trustees
Type : Discussion, Information
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
CSBA's recommended policy language has been updated to add that the Governing Board may take action on 
a request by a Board member to participate by teleconference due to emergency circumstances if it is not on 
the posted agenda so long as there was not sufficient time to place it on the agenda. Additionally, the update 
removes language related to the authority of the district attorney's office or an interested person to file a civil 
action asking the court to order the Board to stop or prevent a Brown Act violation and replace it with language 
requiring the district attorney's office or interested person to first present a demand to "cure and correct" the 
alleged violation and, when such occurs, for the Board to consult with legal counsel on if and how to respond.
The accompanying exhibit is being updated to clarify that the exhibit is a non-exhaustive list of actions that 
require more than a simple majority vote and that have restrictions on when the Governing Board may act. In 
addition, sections have been added on "Actions Required to Occur During a Regular Board Meeting" and 
"Prohibitions on Certain Board Actions." The exhibit has also been updated to reflect new law (SB 494, 2023) 
which prohibits the Board from taking action to terminate a superintendent or assistant superintendent without 
cause within 30 calendar days after the first convening of the Board after a general election at which one or 

Page 9:
more of the Board members are elected or recalled, and new law (SB 229, 2023) which requires a district that 
is disposing of surplus land and has received notification of a violation to hold an open and public meeting to 
review and consider the substance of the notice of violation and prohibits the Board from taking final action to 
ratify or approve the proposed disposal of surplus land until a public meeting is held. The exhibit has also 
been updated for clarity, precision, organization, and consistency.
This is a first reading. It is anticipated that the bylaw will be brought to the Board for a second reading and 
approval at the October 24, 2024 board meeting. The exhibit, with recommended revisions, is included for 
information only, and will not require board approval.

BACKGROUND:
CSBA's recommended policy language has been updated to reflect NEW LAW (SB 494, 2023) prohibiting a

the policy has not been revised since its inception in 2008, numerous updates and language clarifications

Public Content
BACKGROUND:

Page 13:
DUSD staff is bringing the BP and AR 5131.8, Mobile Communication Devices, to the DUSD Board of 
Trustees for their review and consideration. Numerous s tudies continue to show that mobile communication 
device use in the classroom interferes with a students education and lowers student performance. The use of 
these devices is detrimental to students mental health and social skills by promoting cyberbullying and 
increasing levels of student anxiety, depression, and suicide.
Ed Code Section 48901.7 authorizes the governing board to regulate the student's use of phones, 
smartphones, and any other electronic devices in the classroom. Previously, this has been left to the site 
administrator's discretion.BP and AR 5131.8, Mobile Communication Devices will create guidelines on student 
phone use for the district as a whole. 
The drafted policy has been developed in conjunction with the District Technology Committee, utilizing CSBA 
recommended language. The policy has also been reviewed by the Superintendent's Cabinet, which includes 
school principals and DTA representation. Input from these stakeholders has also been incorporated into the 
documents. 
The first reading for this BP and AR were presented on the September 10, 2024 Board meeting, and 
isnowbeing brought to the Board for a second reading and adoption.

Public Content
BACKGROUND:
It is good governance practice for districts to regularly review and update Board Policies (BPs) and 
Administrative Regulations (ARs) to reflect current laws and local practices.
In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released revised regulations that support the implementation 
of Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in publicly funded education programs and activities. As 
part of the ongoing effort to update the board policy manual, Human Resources has identified needed updates 
to the various policies and regulations that are related to and supportive of the mandate. Title IX is a federal 
law that was passed in 1972 to protect students and employees in educational settings from sex 
discrimination. It applies to anyone, regardless of their gender identity, sex, or gender expression, and 
protects against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, and sex characteristics. Title IX 
also protects against sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, 
and sexual violence. The attached "Title IX Board Policies Update" highlights the key updates and essential 
highlights of the policies and procedures being brought to the Board for consideration.
In total, ten (10) BP/ARs will be updated, based on CSBA recommendations, due to the new 2024 Title IX 
regulations.
New Board Policies/Administrative Regulations:
1. AR 4119.13/4219.13/4319.13: 2024 Title IX Sex Discrimination Grievance Procedures (Staff)
2. AR 5145.72: 2024 Title IX Sex Discrimination Grievance Procedures (Students)
Updated Board Policies/Administrative Regulations:
1. BP 0410: Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities
2. BP/AR 1312.3: Uniform Complaint Procedures
3. BP/AR 4030: Nondiscrimination in Employment
4. BP 4033: Lactation Accommodation
5. BP/AR 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment
6. BP/AR 5145.3: Nondiscrimination/Harassment
7. BP/AR 5145.7: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment (retitled)
8. BP 5146: Married/Pregnant/Parenting Students
These were presented for a first reading on September 10, 2024, and are now being brought to the Board for 
a second reading and adoption.
