DUSD
Community,
Monday
is
Veterans
Day,
an
occasion
to
honor
the
brave
men
and
women
who
have
served
in
our 
armed
forces.
I
hope
everyone
uses
this
day
as
an
opportunity
to
express
gratitude
for
the
service 
and
commitment
these
individuals
made
to
our
nation
and
to
reﬂect
on
the
sacriﬁces
they
have 
made
to
protect
our
freedoms
and
ensure
our
safety.
Whether
they
served
in
times
of
peace
or
conﬂict,
our
veterans
have
played
a
vital
role
in
shaping 
the
values
and
liberties
we
hold
dear,
and
for
that,
we
owe
them
a
great
deal.
In
our
school
district,
we
celebrate
this
day
in
many
classrooms
and
in
two
marquee
events,
the 
assemblies
at
Frederiksen
and
Amador.
Students
and
staff
at
both
schools
do
an
exceptional
job 
showing
our
veterans
and
active
duty
personnel
they
are
appreciated.
I
encourage
our
community
to
take
a
moment
on
Veterans
Day
to
thank
a
veteran
or
participate
in 
local
events
that
honor
their
service.
I’d
personally
like
to
thank
the
veterans
in
our
staff
and
community
for
their
service.
Finally,
although
the
Alameda
County
Registrar
of
Voters
has
not
yet
veriﬁed
the
results,
all
signs 
indicate
that
Kristian
Reyes
will
be
the
new
Trustee
for
Area
1.
Trustee
Blackman
ran
unopposed 
and
will
return
as
the
representative
for
Area
4.
We
still
have
work
to
do
to
ﬁll
the
seat
representing 
Area
3.
More
details
on
that
process
will
be
announced
soon.
To
all
our
Trustees,
thank
you
for
your
service
to
this
community.
Sincerely,
Chris

DRAMA's

Play

Friday
(11/8

and
Saturday
(11/9
@
2pm
and
7pm).
Come 
see
Gore
Vidal’s
1960
play
The
Best
Man
.
At
the
presidential
primaries
in
the
summer
of
1960
in
Philadelphia, 
Secretary
of
State
William
Russell
lived
by
his
principles
but
was
haunted
by
recent
health
problems
that 
threatened
his
career
and
vote-winning
potential.
Senator
Joe
Cantwell
presents
himself
as
the
people's 
candidate;
his
determination
to
win
at
all
costs
is
also
his
great
ﬂaw.
Cantwell
is
faced
with
the
revelation
of 
sexual
indiscretions,
threatening
both
his
marriage
and
his
career.
These
two
frontrunners
for
their
party's 
presidential
nomination
ﬁght
for
the
support
of
the
outgoing
president
and
resort
to
mudslinging
in
a
very 
public
contest.

our

headed

Exploratorium
to
deepen
their

learning
experiences.
We
traveled

walked
along
the
Embarcadero.

allowed
our

to
build
connections
outside
the
classroom

increase
their
sense

belonging
in
our 
Dragon
community.
