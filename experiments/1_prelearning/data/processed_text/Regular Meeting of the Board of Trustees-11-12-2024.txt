The District is interested in using real property generally located between Horizon Parkway and Central 
Parkway in the City of Dublin, bearing Assessors Parcel Number 986-69-1 (Property) for the development, 
construction, operation, and maintenance of a public school in the City of Dublin, including all uses necessary,

Prior to acquiring real property for a new school site or for addition to an existing school site, California

Findings). Additional findings are required by the Education Code.
The Property has been studied extensively by District staff and consultants. As a result of these studies and 
investigations, it is concluded that all of the Title 5 Findings are supported. Staff recommends that the Board 
hold a public hearing regarding the Title 5 Findings, consider public comment, and adopt Resolution No. 2024
/25-20, a Resolution Evaluating Real Property in Accordance with School Site Selection Standards and 
Approving the Acquisition of Real Property.
