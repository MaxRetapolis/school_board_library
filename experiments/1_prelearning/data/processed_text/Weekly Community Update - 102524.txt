DUSD
Community,
In
our
recent
Town
Hall
meetings
about
the
budget
challenges
we
anticipate
for
the
2025-2026 
school
year,
we
listed
several
areas
for
potential
reductions.
One
of
those
areas
was
our
Teachers 
on
Special
Assignment
(TOSAs).
Following
these
Town
Hall
meetings,
it
was
clear
we
needed
to
do
a 
better
job
of
communicating
the
role
and
the
value
our
TOSAs
bring
to
the
district.
To
provide
this 
additional
insight,
we
have
developed
a
document
(link
below)
that
highlights
the
individual
TOSA 
positions,
their
accomplishments,
current
work
plans,
job
descriptions,
and
the
potential
impacts 
if
their
jobs
were
to
be
eliminated.
In
the
presentation
we
shared
at
the
Town
Hall
meetings
(link
below)
we
now
provide
job 
descriptions
for
all
the
positions
that
may
be
impacted
by
future
budget
cuts
(see
slide
34).
This
will 
allow
our
community
to
better
understand
the
roles
and
responsibilities
of
these
positions.
We
continue
to
urge
our
community
to
review
this
information
and
provide
us
with
feedback
via
the 
survey.
If
you
have
thoughts
beyond
what
can
be
expressed
in
the
survey,
please
