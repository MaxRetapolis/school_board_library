DUSD REGULAR BOARD MEETING: AUGUST 13, 2024 
The key items discussed  during the August 13, 2024 Regular Board Meeting include: 
● ITEM G2 : Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee Annual Reports for Fiscal Years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 
● ITEM L1 : Resolution No. 2024-25-04, Finding No Further Environmental Review Is Required For the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School 
ITEM G2 : Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee Annual Reports for Fiscal Years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 
The Independent Citizens' Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) is submitting the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 Annual Reports to the Board of Trustees. Due to 
committee membership turnover, the 2021-2022 report has not been presented to the Board and both reports are being presented simultaneously. The 
purpose of the CBOC is to inform the public and the Board regarding expenditures of bond funds pursuant to Education Code Section 15278. In order to 
notify the community of the availability of the reports, the CBOC has decided to post ﬂyers with QR code links in all community facilities such as City Hall, 
the library, The Wave, and the Senior Center. Messages will be sent out through District communication channels to families, and CBOC members will post 
on local social media platforms as well. In addition, District Communications staff will add information regarding the availability of the reports to the 
District website, issue a press release to the local media, and route to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Presenting the reports is the current CBOC Chair, 
Seema Badar.

ITEM L1 : Resolution No. 2024-25-04, Finding No Further Environmental Review Is Required For the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School 
The Dublin Crossing Speciﬁc Plan originally consisted of the demolition of existing dwellings and other site improvements, and the construction of a  
residential mixed-use development with up to 1,995 single and multi-family residential units; up to 200,000 square feet of retail, office and/or commercial  
uses; a 30-acre community park and a ﬁve-acre neighborhood park (“Project”). The Project also included a 12-acre school site to serve up to 900  
kindergarten through 5th grade students (“Original School Project”). On November 5, 2013, the City of Dublin (“City”) approved the Project, which included  
the Original School Project, and adopted Resolution No. 186-13 certifying the Dublin Crossing Speciﬁc Plan Final Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) for  the 
Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2012062009) in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) and the  
CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15000 et seq.) (“CEQA”). In connection with the consideration and adoption of the Dublin Crossing Speciﬁc Plan and  
EIR, a Statement of Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations (“SOC”), a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (“MMRP”), were also  
adopted. The District was notiﬁed by the City pursuant to all applicable CEQA provisions during the environmental review process conducted for the EIR  
and reviewed and commented on the EIR. Further, the previously certiﬁed EIR evaluated and mitigated the impacts of the Original School Project with the  
anticipated development of the Dublin Crossing Speciﬁc Plan. The District has now determined that the Dublin Crossing community would be better  served  
by siting a TK-8 school, to be named the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School, in the Project area rather than the originally proposed K-5 school and expanding the  
number of students from 900 to 1,054 (“Revised School Project”). The Revised School Project would be located on the same 12-acre location as the Original  
School Project. Public Resources Code section 21166 requires that “when an environmental impact report has been prepared for a project, no subsequent  
or supplemental environmental impact report shall be required by the lead agency or by any responsible agency, unless one or more of the following events  
occur: 
● Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report; 
● Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in  
the environmental impact report; 
● New information, which was not known and could not have been known at the time the environmental impact report was certiﬁed as complete,  
becomes available.”

June 19: Juneteenth All Consent Agenda items ( ITEMS M1-Q6 ) were approved by the board in a 4-0 vote (Trustee Cherrier being absent) CONSENT AGENDA: None of the above events apply to the Revised School Project, and the addition of 154 students are considered minor.  School additions are considered  
minor when the addition would increase capacity by less than 25% or 10 classrooms. (CEQA Guidelines, section 15314.) The Original School Project was for  
900 students and the Revised School Project is designed for capacity of 1,054 students. This will only increase student capacity by 17.1%, with a  
corresponding increase of 6 classrooms. Further, the District commissioned a Transportation Impact Study which also found that the increase of 154  
students would not cause any signiﬁcant impacts to traffic or transportation. Accordingly, based on the above: 1) the Revised School Project is not  
proposing substantial changes to the Project and will not require any revisions to the EIR; 2) there are no substantial changes with respect to the  
circumstances under which the Project is being undertaken, and 3) there is no new information of substantial importance. Should the Board adopt the  
Resolution, the Board will have determined that the revisions to the Original School Project will not require revisions to the EIR because none of the  
conditions in Public Resources Code section 21166 are applicable, and the CEQA requirements for the Revised School Project will have been fulﬁlled.
