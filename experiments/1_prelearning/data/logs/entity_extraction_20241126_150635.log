The Board introduced two leadership staff members hired over the summer:  Cindy Ma, our new Child Nutrition Supervisor  Chiharu Kitchens, the new Assistant Principal at Dublin High.ITEM L1 : Resolution No. 2024-25-04, Finding No Further Environmental Review Is Required For the Shamrock Hills TK-8 SchoolThe Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan originally consisted of the demolition of existing dwellings and other site improvements, and the construction of aresidential mixed-use development with up to 1,995 single and multi-family residential units; up to 200,000 square feet of retail, office and/or commercialuses; a 30-acre community park and a  ve-acre neighborhood park ( Project ). The Project also included a 12-acre school site to serve up to 900kindergarten through 5th grade students ( Original School Project ). On November 5, 2013, the City of Dublin ( City ) approved the Project, which includedthe Original School Project, and adopted Resolution No. 186-13 certifying the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan Final Environmental Impact Report ( EIR ) for  theProject (State Clearinghouse No. 2012062009) in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,   21000 et seq.) and theCEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs.,   15000 et seq.) ( CEQA ). In connection with the consideration and adoption of the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan andEIR, a Statement of Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations ( SOC ), a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ( MMRP ), were alsoadopted. The District was noti ed by the City pursuant to all applicable CEQA provisions during the environmental review process conducted for the EIRand reviewed and commented on the EIR. Further, the previously certi ed EIR evaluated and mitigated the impacts of the Original School Project with theanticipated development of the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan. The District has now determined that the Dublin Crossing community would be better  servedby siting a TK-8 school, to be named the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School, in the Project area rather than the originally proposed K-5 school and expanding thenumber of students from 900 to 1,054 ( Revised School Project ). The Revised School Project would be located on the same 12-acre location as the OriginalSchool Project. Public Resources Code section 21166 requires that  when an environmental impact report has been prepared for a project, no subsequentor supplemental environmental impact report shall be required by the lead agency or by any responsible agency, unless one or more of the following eventsoccur:  Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report;  Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in

**Ontology Expert Mode Activation**

You are now operating in Ontology Expert Mode. As an expert in ontologies, you understand complex structures involving entities, relationships, events, processes, and states within specific domains.

**Goal**

Your task is to extract and categorize entities from provided chunks of documents related to school board operations. The extracted entities should be mapped according to the predefined ontology for the School Board New Member Copilot, which includes:

    - Events
    - People
    - Organizations
    - Documents
    - Resources

**Detailed Definition of Events**

Events are dynamic occurrences or happenings that take place at a specific point in time or over a period within the school board context. They involve temporal and causal aspects that impact the school board's operations.

**Types of Events to Extract**

    1. **Board Meetings**
        - Regular or special sessions where policies are discussed and decisions are made.
    2. **Committee Sessions**
        - Meetings focused on specific areas like finance, curriculum, or facilities.

        - School openings, award ceremonies, or other public engagements.
    9. **Emergency Responses**
        - Actions taken during crises like natural disasters or health emergencies.
    10. **Legal Proceedings**
        - Lawsuits or compliance hearings affecting the school district.

**Attributes to Extract for Each Event**

    - **Event Name:** The official or commonly used name of the event.
    - **Event Type:** Category of the event (e.g., Board Meeting, Policy Approval).
    - **Date and Time:** When the event occurred or is scheduled to occur. **Ensure that the year is included. If the date is not explicitly mentioned within the event details, infer it from the document's file name or overall context.**
    - **Location:** Where the event took place or will take place.
    - **Participants:** Individuals or groups involved (e.g., board members, committees).
    - **Agenda Items or Topics Discussed:** Key issues or subjects addressed during the event.
    - **Decisions Made or Outcomes:** Results or resolutions from the event.
    - **Related Documents:** Any documents associated with the event (e.g., meeting minutes, reports).

**Differences with Other Entities**

    - **People:** Individuals like board members, staff, students, or community members. They are participants in events but are not events themselves.
    - **Organizations:** Entities such as the school district, individual schools, or committees.
    - **Documents:** Artifacts produced or referenced, like policies, reports, or meeting minutes.
    - **Resources:** Assets like budget items, facilities, or equipment.

*Note:* While events are actions or occurrences, other entities are static or semi-static elements that may participate in or be affected by events.

**Instructions**

    1. **Read the Document Carefully**
        - Analyze the provided text thoroughly to understand the context.

    2. **Identify and Extract Events**
        - Look for occurrences that match the defined event types.
        - Determine if the text describes an event based on the definitions provided.

    3. **Extract Relevant Attributes**
        - For each identified event, extract as many attributes as are available.
        - **If the "Date and Time" attribute is not explicitly mentioned within the event details, infer the date (including the year) from the document's file name or the surrounding context.**
        - If an attribute is not mentioned, you may omit it in the output.

    4. **Differentiate Between Entities**
        - Ensure that you correctly categorize information as events, people, organizations, documents, or resources.
        - Do not confuse events with other entities.

    5. **Provide Structured Output**
        - Present the extracted information in a clear, structured format as specified below.

2024-11-26 15:27:01,614 - INFO - Ollama API response for Chunk 4: To address the task you provided and extract entities from school board documents using the specified ontology, I will follow these steps:

1. Read the document carefully
2. Identify and extract events according to the predefined ontology for the School Board New Member Copilot.
3. Extract relevant attributes for each identified event.

The text given is a sample excerpt from a school board meeting document.

**Step 1: Read the Document Carefully**

The provided text excerpt discusses upcoming board meetings, district dates, and a consent agenda item related to the Revised School Project.

**Step 2: Identify and Extract Events**

Based on the ontology for the School Board New Member Copilot, I identified the following events:

- **Event Name:** Revisions to the Original School Project
- **Event Type:** Policy Approvals and Amendments

There isn't an explicit mention of all attributes in this event.

**Step 3: Extract Relevant Attributes**

For each extracted event, here are the relevant attributes with the information available from the text excerpt:

- **Event Name:** Revisions to the Original School Project
  - **Event Type:** Policy Approvals and Amendments

- **Date and Time:** Not explicitly mentioned, but can be inferred as part of the consent agenda item (not directly related to the event).
  
- **Location:** Not specified in the text.

- **Participants:** Board members involved in the decision-making process.

- **Agenda Items or Topics Discussed:** The addition of 154 students and its impact on transportation, capacity increase, and school project details.

- **Decisions Made or Outcomes:** Approved by a 4-0 vote (Trustee Cherrier absent), with minor additions to student capacity under 25%.

- **Related Documents:** Not specified in the text excerpt provided.

**Additional Notes**

Given the nature of the document, some information was not explicitly mentioned. For accuracy and completeness, it's essential to note these omissions:

- The date and time for this event are inferred from the context but not directly stated.
- The location is not specified.
- Specific details about the transportation impact study or its findings are not mentioned in the excerpt provided.
