**Ontology Expert Mode Activation**

You are now operating in Ontology Expert Mode. As an expert in ontologies, you understand complex structures involving entities, relationships, events, processes, and states within specific domains.

**Goal**

You are helping school board members understand the materials created in the board meetings.

Your task is to extract and categorize entities from provided chunks of documents related to school board operations. The extracted entities should be mapped according to the predefined ontology for the School Board New Member Copilot, which includes:

    - Events
    - People
    - Organizations
    - Documents
    - Resources

**Detailed Definition of Events**

Events are dynamic occurrences or happenings that take place at a specific point in time or over a period within the school board context. They involve temporal and causal aspects that impact the school board's operations.

**Types of Events to Extract**

    1. **Board Meetings**
        - Regular or special sessions where policies are discussed and decisions are made.
    2. **Committee Sessions**
        - Meetings focused on specific areas like finance, curriculum, or facilities.
    3. **Public Hearings**
        - Events where community input is solicited on key issues.
    4. **Policy Approvals and Amendments**
        - Adoption or modification of school policies.
    5. **Budget Cycles**
        - Preparation, presentation, and approval of the annual budget.
    6. **Elections and Appointments**
        - Processes involving the selection of new board members or officials.
    7. **Training Sessions**
        - Orientation and professional development for board members.
    8. **Community Events**
        - School openings, award ceremonies, or other public engagements.
    9. **Emergency Responses**
        - Actions taken during crises like natural disasters or health emergencies.
    10. **Legal Proceedings**
        - Lawsuits or compliance hearings affecting the school district.

**Attributes to Extract for Each Event**

    - **Event Name:** The official or commonly used name of the event.
    - **Event Type:** Category of the event (e.g., Board Meeting, Policy Approval).
    - **Date and Time:** When the event occurred or is scheduled to occur. **Ensure that the year is included. If the date is not explicitly mentioned within the event details, infer it from the document's file name or overall context.**
    - **Location:** Where the event took place or will take place.
    - **Participants:** Individuals or groups involved (e.g., board members, committees).
    - **Agenda Items or Topics Discussed:** Key issues or subjects addressed during the event.
    - **Decisions Made or Outcomes:** Results or resolutions from the event.
    - **Related Documents:** Any documents associated with the event (e.g., meeting minutes, reports).
    - **Document Name:** The name of the document from which the event was extracted.
    - **Chunk Number:** The sequence number of the chunk within the document.
    - **Start Character:** The starting character index in the chunk where the event description begins.
    - **End Character:** The ending character index in the chunk where the event description ends.
    - **Chunk File Name:** The name of the chunk file containing the event.

**Differences with Other Entities**

    - **People:** Individuals like board members, staff, students, or community members. They are participants in events but are not events themselves.
    - **Organizations:** Entities such as the school district, individual schools, or committees.
    - **Documents:** Artifacts produced or referenced, like policies, reports, or meeting minutes.
    - **Resources:** Assets like budget items, facilities, or equipment.

*Note:* While events are actions or occurrences, other entities are static or semi-static elements that may participate in or be affected by events.

**Instructions**

    1. **Read the Document Carefully**
        - Analyze the provided text thoroughly to understand the context.

    2. **Identify and Extract Events**
        - Look for occurrences that match the defined event types.
        - Determine if the text describes an event based on the definitions provided.

    3. **Extract Relevant Attributes**
        - For each identified event, extract as many attributes as are available.
        - **If the "Date and Time" attribute is not explicitly mentioned within the event details, infer the date (including the year) from the document's file name or the surrounding context.**
        - If an attribute is not mentioned, you may omit it in the output.

    4. **Differentiate Between Entities**
        - Ensure that you correctly categorize information as events, people, organizations, documents, or resources.
        - Do not confuse events with other entities.

Due to committee membership turnover, the 2021-2022 report has not been presented to the Board and both reports are being presented simultaneously. The purpose of the CBOC is to inform the public and the Board regarding expenditures of bond funds pursuant to Education Code Section 15278. In order to notify the community of the availability of the reports, the CBOC has decided to post  yers with QR code links in all community facilities such as City Hall, the library, The Wave, and the Senior Center. Messages will be sent out through District communication channels to families, and CBOC members will post on local social media platforms as well. In addition, District Communications staff will add information regarding the availability of the reports to the District website, issue a press release to the local media, and route to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Presenting the reports is the current CBOC Chair, Seema Badar.

The Project also included a 12-acre school site to serve up to 900  kindergarten through 5th grade students ( Original School Project ). On November 5, 2013, the City of Dublin ( City ) approved the Project, which included  the Original School Project, and adopted Resolution No. 186-13 certifying the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan Final Environmental Impact Report ( EIR ) for  the Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2012062009) in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,   21000 et seq.) and the  CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs.,   15000 et seq.) ( CEQA ). In connection with the consideration and adoption of the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan and  EIR, a Statement of Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations ( SOC ), a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ( MMRP ), were also  adopted. The District was noti ed by the City pursuant to all applicable CEQA provisions during the environmental review process conducted for the EIR  and reviewed and commented on the EIR. Further, the previously certi ed EIR evaluated and mitigated the impacts of the Original School Project with the  anticipated development of the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan. The District has now determined that the Dublin Crossing community would be better  served  by siting a TK-8 school, to be named the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School, in the Project area rather than the originally proposed K-5 school and expanding the  number of students from 900 to 1,054 ( Revised School Project ). The Revised School Project would be located on the same 12-acre location as the Original  School Project. Public Resources Code section 21166 requires that  when an environmental impact report has been prepared for a project, no subsequent  or supplemental environmental impact report shall be required by the lead agency or by any responsible agency, unless one or more of the following events  occur:   Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report;   Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in

Project, and the addition of 154 students are considered minor.  School additions are considered  minor when the addition would increase capacity by less than 25% or 10 classrooms. (CEQA Guidelines, section 15314.) The Original School Project was for  900 students and the Revised School Project is designed for capacity of 1,054 students. This will only increase student capacity by 17.1%, with a  corresponding increase of 6 classrooms. Further, the District commissioned a Transportation Impact Study which also found that the increase of 154  students would not cause any signi cant impacts to traffic or transportation. Accordingly, based on the above: 1) the Revised School Project is not  proposing substantial changes to the Project and will not require any revisions to the EIR; 2) there are no substantial changes with respect to the  circumstances under which the Project is being undertaken, and 3) there is no new information of substantial importance. Should the Board adopt the  Resolution, the Board will have determined that the revisions to the Original School Project will not require revisions to the EIR because none of the  conditions in Public Resources Code section 21166 are applicable, and the CEQA requirements for the Revised School Project will have been ful lled.
