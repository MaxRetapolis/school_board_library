* Time of the meeting
* Location of the meeting (not explicitly mentioned)
* Number of attendees (not explicitly mentioned)

To extract these attributes, we can look for phrases that provide this information. For example:

* "I'm passing the baton off to my first vp" implies that there is a vice president who will be taking over.
* "She is gonna be filling in my chair until election time" suggests that there is an election scheduled.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the date of the meeting or the exact location. Therefore, we may need to make some assumptions based on the context.

Based on the context, it appears that the meeting is taking place at a certain school, possibly Emerald High, which is mentioned as one of the schools where Karen Chamberlain is a campus supervisor.

Assuming that the meeting is taking place at Emerald High, and considering that Karen Chamberlain is the new vice president, we can make an educated guess about the date of the meeting. However, without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact date.

In terms of extracting events and attributes, here's a suggested output:

* Event: Board meeting of CSCA
	+ Date: [Assumed date based on context]
	+ Time: [Not explicitly mentioned]
	+ Location: Emerald High (possibly)
	+ Attendees: Unknown number
	+ Speakers: CSCA and Karen Chamberlain

Please note that this is just one possible interpretation, and the actual output may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
