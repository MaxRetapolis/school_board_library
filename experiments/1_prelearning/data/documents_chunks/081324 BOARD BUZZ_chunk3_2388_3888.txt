( Project ). The Project also included a 12-acre school site to serve up to 900  kindergarten through 5th grade students ( Original School Project ). On November 5, 2013, the City of Dublin ( City ) approved the Project, which included  the Original School Project, and adopted Resolution No. 186-13 certifying the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan Final Environmental Impact Report ( EIR ) for  the Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2012062009) in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,   21000 et seq.) and the  CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs.,   15000 et seq.) ( CEQA ). In connection with the consideration and adoption of the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan and  EIR, a Statement of Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations ( SOC ), a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ( MMRP ), were also  adopted. The District was noti ed by the City pursuant to all applicable CEQA provisions during the environmental review process conducted for the EIR  and reviewed and commented on the EIR. Further, the previously certi ed EIR evaluated and mitigated the impacts of the Original School Project with the  anticipated development of the Dublin Crossing Speci c Plan. The District has now determined that the Dublin Crossing community would be better  served  by siting a TK-8 school, to be named the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School, in the Project area rather than the originally proposed K-5 school and expanding the  number of students from 900
