Crossing Speci c Plan. The District has now determined that the Dublin Crossing community would be better  served  by siting a TK-8 school, to be named the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School, in the Project area rather than the originally proposed K-5 school and expanding the  number of students from 900 to 1,054 ( Revised School Project ). The Revised School Project would be located on the same 12-acre location as the Original  School Project. Public Resources Code section 21166 requires that  when an environmental impact report has been prepared for a project, no subsequent  or supplemental environmental impact report shall be required by the lead agency or by any responsible agency, unless one or more of the following events  occur:   Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report;   Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in  the environmental impact report;   New information, which was not known and could not have been known at the time the environmental impact report was certi ed as complete,  becomes available.
