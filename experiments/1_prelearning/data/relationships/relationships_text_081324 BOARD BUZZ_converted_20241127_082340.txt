The Regular Board Meeting for August 13, 2024, includes the following items:

* ** ITEM G2**: Citizens Bond Oversight Committee Annual Reports for Fiscal Years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023
	+ The Independent Citizens' Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) submitted these reports to the Board of Trustees.
* ** ITEM L1**: Resolution No. 2024-25-04, Finding No Further Environmental Review Is Required For the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School
	+ This resolution was discussed during the meeting and is part of the Regular Board Meeting agenda.


**Analysis:**

The CBOC presented two annual reports to the Board of Trustees for Fiscal Years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. These reports provide information on expenditures of bond funds pursuant to Education Code Section 15278, which allows public institutions of higher education (such as schools) to use their bond funds for specific purposes.

The Resolution No. 2024-25-04 is related to the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School and was discussed during the meeting. The resolution mentions finding no further environmental review required for this school's renovation, which may involve changes in its educational program or facilities.


**Recommendations:**

Based on the information provided, it appears that:

* The CBOC has prepared two annual reports to present to the Board of Trustees.
* These reports are necessary to inform the public and the Board regarding expenditures of bond funds.
* The Resolution No. 2024-25-04 is related to the Shamrock Hills TK-8 School's renovation, which may involve changes in its educational program or facilities.
