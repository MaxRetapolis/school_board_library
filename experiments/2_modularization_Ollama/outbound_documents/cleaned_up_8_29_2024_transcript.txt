Our meeting of the Dublin Unified School District Board of Trustees. We will start with a roll call.

Trustee Spec: here.
Trustee Blackman has not yet arrived and neither has Trustee Chair. Vice President Quo: here.
President Pelham: here.
We have a quorum. Thank you.

Alrighty, our first item will be the adoption of the agenda. Are there any changes from staff?
No changes. Anything a trustee would like to pull or anything? I'll take a motion.
I'll move we adopt the agenda. I'll second.

Trustee Pei: Aye. Everyone else: Aye, Aye, Aye. Carries unanimously.

Um, and then we will do the Pledge of Allegiance. Everyone remove your hats. The flag is right behind me here.

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

All right, thank you. If you wouldn't mind reading our district mission statement?

Mission statement: Dublin Unified School District will educate every student to become a lifelong learner by providing a safe and supportive environment that fosters collective responsibility for each student's success.

All righty, thank you. Note that Trustee Blackman has arrived to join us for the rest of the meeting.

First, we are going to start out with some recognition, which I think is what most of our audience is here for tonight.
As much as you enjoy board policies, I'm sure you're here for this.

President Pelham: I'm so excited to recognize our Dublin Little League softball teams—our 10 and under, and our 12 and under. Rarely do we have this much happiness and excitement during a board meeting, and so, so noted. Thank you all for being here.

I think we all got a chance to watch two games on ESPN to see the 12 and under team perform outstandingly. What's also amazing is when you think about both teams, the majority of the players attend our schools. For the 12 and under, 11 of the 12 players attend Wells, and one from Livermore participates. For the 10 and under, we have students represented from several of our elementary schools including Dublin, L. Murray, John Green, and F. Frederickson.

Dr. Campbell, would you please introduce the teams and bring up the coaches?

Dr. Campbell: It is my pleasure. I'd like to have the 10 and under coaches come on up, please.

(Players are introduced and certificates given)

Coach Jimmy Dikes: On behalf of the 10U team, as a Dublin Unified alum and Dublin Little League alum, I want to thank the school board and community for the support this summer. The girls pulled off multiple practices a week, multiple games, 90-100 degree heat. Thank you for the recognition.

Now I'd like to introduce the 12 and under team—state champions, regional championship game, one game away from the World Series, multiple appearances on ESPN.

(12U players introduced and certificates given)

Coach Schafer: Thank you for having us. Special thanks for the assembly at Wells. The girls represented themselves, their families, their team, the city, and Dublin Little League in the best way possible. We're extremely proud of these girls.

A parent, Vanessa Kehe, presents a Congressional Recognition Award from Congressman Eric Swalwell to each of the 12U girls in celebration of their winning the CA State Championship and becoming runners-up in the Western Region.

All right, congrats everybody, and thank you for representing Dublin so well.

We will now hear from our student representative for the student board member report.

Student Board Member: As the school year has started, many events have kicked off. Highlights:

Emerald High School had a grand opening celebration.
Emerald had its back-to-school night.
Valley High School started the year with an ice cream social, a culinary class, and a Las Positas college class once a week.

I attended the National Student Board Member Association conference.
I am working on interviewing college admissions officers to clarify processes for students.
Fall sports have started, everyone is eager to attend games.
Thank you. We are off to a good start in all our schools.
