Motions and Board Actions
Adoption of the Agenda:

Motion passed unanimously.
Consent Calendar Items (G, H, I, J, K):
Multiple items were pulled for separate consideration based on trustee requests:

H1 (AI Policy): Approved with adjustments to remove “upon request” language in one section. Vote was unanimous after amendment.
G3 (Board Elections): Modified language to ensure orientation for new board candidates is always offered, not just upon request. Motion passed unanimously after amendment.
H2 (Disposal of Obsolete Materials): Passed unanimously. A trustee requested offering old textbooks to community before disposal.
H3 (Elementary Field Trip to Ferry): Approved 4-1 despite one trustee’s safety/ratio concerns.
J6 (Recruitment and Selection Policy): Passed 3-2 after debate on language referencing diversity in hiring. Two trustees expressed concern about the potential legal implications of referencing racial/ethnic diversity. Staff noted the language is based on CSBA guidance.
Other Pulled Items (G4, H1, etc.):

G4 (Filling Vacancies): Will be brought back for a third reading after minor clarifications.
H1 (AI Policy): Initially discussed at length; ultimately approved with friendly amendments and future input from staff.
No other major policy decisions were finalized beyond those indicated above.

Parent/Community Input
Topics Addressed by the Public:

Safety and Communications (Dublin High):
A parent expressed concern over a recent assault on a student and a separate shelter-in-place incident within the same week. They demanded clearer updates on what steps the Board will take to prevent such incidents and improve communication.
Representative Quote: “We cannot afford such incidents…What specific actions is the board going to take to hold people accountable?”

Emerald High Safety, Traffic, and Lighting Concerns:
Public speakers at a previous meeting had raised issues about traffic flow, bike racks, and nighttime lighting. Although no direct public comment on this tonight, the Superintendent later noted staff responses, including repainted crosswalks, adjusted lighting timers, and installing more bike racks.

Recruitment & Diversity in Hiring:
Two trustees objected to policy language referencing diversity in recruitment, citing legal concerns. One public speaker (online) questioned SDC (Special Day Class) staffing levels at Dublin High and sought clarity on how the district will address it.

Representative Quotes from Speakers
From a concerned parent on safety: “We are worried…What specific steps is the board going to take to prevent…such behavior?”
From Coach Schafer (12U softball): “We are very, very proud of these girls for what they accomplished.”
Outcome and Next Steps
Final Decisions & Implications:

AI Policy: Approved. The district will implement guidelines on AI usage and will revisit if needed. It remains a dynamic policy that may evolve with legal guidance.
Recruitment and Selection Policy: Approved 3-2 but may warrant revisiting if legal landscapes change. The district emphasizes qualifications and fair hiring while acknowledging diversity goals.
Facilities Updates: Staff confirmed progress and timelines on major projects including Murray Elementary, Dublin Elementary, Emerald High phases, gym HVAC installations, and Shamrock Hills TK-8. All projects are on/below budget, with detailed encumbered amounts provided.
Future Considerations:
Budget community forums in September at Dublin High and Emerald High plus a virtual session.
Superintendent Funk will hold community input sessions on developing a “Graduate Profile.”
Potential future agenda items include communication protocols for emergencies, clarification of grading/syllabus consistency, and updates on athletic funding equity.
Unresolved Issues:

Trustee concerns regarding legal implications of referencing diversity in hiring may require future review.
Ensuring consistent and equitable field support for athletics at both high schools may come back as a future report.
The district will continue refining safety procedures, traffic flow solutions, and communication protocols as requested by the community.
