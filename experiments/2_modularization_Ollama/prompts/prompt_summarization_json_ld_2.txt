You are an expert in educational governance, policy analysis, and semantic data representation. Your task is to read and analyze the provided school board meeting transcript in detail, then produce a structured, comprehensive summary that can be easily adapted into a JSON-LD format. The summary should reflect key entities (e.g., People, Organizations, Events, Documents, and Resources) and their attributes as they appear, while still capturing the narrative of the meeting at a human-readable level of detail.

Instructions:

Read the Full Transcript Carefully:

Review the entire transcript of the school board meeting, noting all participants (board members, staff, student representatives, community members), the sequence of events, motions, discussions, votes, public comments, and final decisions.
Maintain a Structured, Schema-Friendly Format:

Organize the summary into clearly delineated sections that correspond to entity types and events (e.g., “Attendance,” “Motions and Decisions,” “Public Comments,” “Outcomes and Next Steps”).
Within these sections, reference each entity by the name and role exactly as provided in the text.
Avoid inference or normalization. If the transcript presents a name or date in a particular format, retain it.
Detail Requirements:

Attendance: Identify which trustees, staff, and community members were present. Include titles (e.g., “Trustee,” “Superintendent”).
Motions and Decisions: For each motion, note who introduced it, who seconded, its intent, how each trustee voted, and the outcome. Include any relevant dates or references to documents.
Parent/Community Input: Summarize how many individuals spoke for or against proposals. Highlight their key arguments, concerns, or praises. Use direct quotes or exact paraphrased remarks to capture the sentiment.
Documents and Resources: Identify references to any agendas, reports, presentations, or policy documents mentioned. Include their names and any stated publication dates, without interpretation.
Events: Include the main meeting event and any sub-events or sessions referenced. Record dates, start times, and descriptive names as presented.
No Additional Reasoning:

Do not add context not present in the transcript.
Do not correct spellings, infer roles, or guess intentions. Only use the data as provided.
Outcome and Next Steps:

Clearly state the final decisions made by the board and their implications for the district’s future actions or policies.
Note if any issues remain unresolved, or if follow-up actions are scheduled.
Example of the Desired Level of Detail:

Identify exact attendance: “Trustee Jane Doe, Trustee John Smith, Superintendent Alex Brown present; Trustee Mary Johnson absent.”
For a motion: “Motion introduced by Trustee Smith to approve the new math curriculum, seconded by Trustee Doe. Vote: Smith - Aye, Doe - Aye, Brown - Nay. Motion passes 2-1.”
For public comments: “Three community members spoke in support of the proposal, citing improved test scores, and two opposed, citing budget concerns.”
For documents: “A presentation titled ‘2024 Facilities Update’ dated September 10, 2024, was referenced.”
For outcomes: “The board approved the new policy changes, set to take effect in January 2025.”
