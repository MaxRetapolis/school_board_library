presentation.

107
00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:03.432
As you can see, we've been presented by BHM the first

108
00:06:03.432 --> 00:06:07.407
increment, which is our utility and underground work for

109
00:06:07.407 --> 00:06:10.182
the site, which was the first increment that was submitted

110
00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:11.772
to DSA and approved.

111
00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:13.222
Earlier this year.

112
00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:16.952
That uh, total price came to 5.9 million just a little over

113
00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:18.092
5.9 million.

114
00:06:18.092 --> 00:06:22.232
um, we went ahead and we looked at this, and we looked back

115
00:06:22.232 --> 00:06:24.812
at the original proposal that was submitted by

116
00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:26.982
vhm during their

117
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.252
Um, the proposal for the RFP that we took and they are well

118
00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:34.072
within their budget guidelines for this underground work.

119
00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:36.412
That was that was originally submitted for us.

120
00:06:36.412 --> 00:06:39.952
um, so as you can see there, the total project budget that

121
00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:41.022
we had was

122
00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:45.552
Uh, 10256600213.

126
00:06:54.502 --> 00:06:57.562

00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:31.998
program and the new offerings that will have at Shamrock

155
00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:33.018
Hills School.

156
00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:38.028
So as mentioned before, there are 4 main buildings. On the

157
00:08:38.028 --> 00:08:41.678
Shamrock, Hills campus, there are 2 uh classroom buildings

158
00:08:41.678 --> 00:08:45.708
which include Administration library and flexible spaces,

159
00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:49.938
and there is also a multi-purpose room building and a gym.

160
00:08:49.938 --> 00:08:53.048
The elementary facility building the classroom building

161
00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:56.748
contains 7 TK classrooms 20 standard Elementary classrooms

162
00:08:56.748 --> 00:09:00.798
work rooms and a flexible lab classroom.

163
00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:05.318
All the TK classrooms are on the ground floor and face an

164
00:09:05.318 --> 00:09:09.098
inward-facing playground area. That's that's controlled and

165
00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:12.608
fenced. So that um we can make sure that with the

166
00:09:12.608 --> 00:09:15.548
centralized playground play is safe and fun and easily

167
00:09:15.548 --> 00:09:16.538
observable.

168
00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:20.188
There's also a standalone MPR building that has a capacity

169
00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:24.460
of 815 occupants, in addition to a multi-purpose room, the

170
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.928
MPR houses a new kitchen and serving area as well as a

171
00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:31.348
dedicated band room, where we've built built-in um

172
00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:34.738
instrument storage, as well as acoustically, controlled

173
00:09:34.738 --> 00:09:37.628
practice rooms. And we worked pretty really closely with

174
00:09:37.628 --> 00:09:40.138
the band program in order to develop what they needed.

175
00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:40.618
Their

176
00:09:40.618 --> 00:09:42.328
um,

177
00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:45.798
so you can see on the next slide, this is actually the

178
00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:49.178
the inward playground facing face of the MPR.

179
00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:53.018
The stage of the MPR has foldable partitions and opens onto

180
00:09:53.018 --> 00:09:55.980
an outdoor Amphitheater to enjoy a performance or a lesson

181
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:57.338
on a sunny day.

182
00:09:57.598 --> 00:10:00.578
For our middle school facilities for the middle school,

183
00:10:00.578 --> 00:10:03.188
classroom building, there are 3 science classrooms 12

184
00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:06.338
standard, classrooms 2 SDC rooms.

185
00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:09.923
Classrooms prep rooms, a shared Library, a Wellness Center

186
00:10:09.924 --> 00:10:13.108
collaboration spaces and administrative offices.

187
00:10:13.108 --> 00:10:16.411
Student service areas like the wellness center, the health

188
00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:18.864
office and the library are centralized to increase

189
00:10:18.864 --> 00:10:21.738
visibility and accessibility for students. We want the

190
00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:24.498
students to know what's available and be able to utilize

191
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:25.608
the services there.

192
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:31.098
The adjacent gym building has bleacher seating for up to

193
00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:35.958
1235 students, families and staff. It also has locker rooms

194
00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.908
offices and Equipment storage.

195
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:42.025
In this new slide, you can see 1 of the 2 playgrounds that

196
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.104
have at Shamrock Hills School. This is the elementary

197
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:48.829
school playground, which includes tricycle biking paths,

198
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:51.937
which you see in blue Kinder appropriate, play equipment,

199
00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:55.681
surrounded by port and place. Safety surfacing outdoor

200
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:59.281
eating areas that are covered by shade structures and a

201
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:00.301
sensory path.

202
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:03.311
That joins more traditional Hopscotch to offer, new ways of

203
00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:05.591
learning and enjoying the outdoors.

204
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:09.389
This playground is, you can see here is fully included, buy

205
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:12.281
ornamental fencing to ensure that the youngest students are

206
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:14.441
safe and observable at all times.

207
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:19.181
The Middle School play area, which you're looking at now,

208
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:21.101
includes its own set of play structures. Geared towards

209
00:11:21.101 --> 00:11:22.451
older students.

210
00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:25.228
Similar to the other ground, the other playground, these

211
00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:27.771
structures are surrounded by port in place rubber safety

212
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:28.911
Servicing.

213
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:32.061
We'll have tetherball and 4 Square quarts. Will line the

214
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:34.701
edges of the playground with plenty of covered seating

215
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:37.298
which you can see some of which here including this, large

216
00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:39.650
shade structure to enjoy lunch on a warm day,

217
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:42.691
To the south of the main playground area. There are

218
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.751
multiple play courts, including basketball, ball walls and

219
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:46.771
4 Square.

220
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:50.499
So that's a that's a general rundown of the scope and the

221
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.699
project that we have right now and all the efforts that

222
00:11:52.699 --> 00:11:56.251
we're doing to provide the best facilities for the students

223
00:11:56.251 --> 00:11:59.617
and for the Dublin community. And thank you very much for

224
00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:01.981
letting me share that with you. With that, I will hand it

225
00:12:01.981 --> 00:12:03.511
back to you, Owen.

226
00:12:04.441 --> 00:12:06.281
Thank you, Juan.

227
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:10.991
So our ask today of the board is to approve this GM, this

228
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:14.051
initial GMP for increment 1 for Shamrock, Hills in the

229
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:16.541
amount of 59912000.

230
00:12:16.941 --> 00:12:17.941
4.

231
00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:25.381
Is there any questions or comments from the board, uh,

232
00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:26.221
trustee Terrier?

233
00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:30.781
Thank you, great. Great presentation. Um,

234
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:35.841
I, I have some terms that went by me that

235
00:12:35.841 --> 00:12:39.341
I guess I'm not smart enough to understand, uh, what is

236
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.601
SDC.

237
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:46.621
Special day class special day. Okay? And what is meant by a

238
00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:48.211
shared Band Room?

239
00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:51.801
So we have the band room that's designed in will serve the

240
00:12:51.801 --> 00:12:55.246
middle school students but also will serve programmatically

241
00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:58.226
could serve some of the elementary. So when we say shared

242
00:12:58.227 --> 00:13:01.153
meaning that not 1 or the other has complete control over

243
00:13:01.153 --> 00:13:03.511
it but it'll be shared between the 2. Okay?

244
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:06.771
So that's the same that's why there's no music room listed

245
00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:09.231
under the the elementary rooms.

246
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:10.502
Correct. Okay.

247
00:13:10.502 --> 00:13:12.382
and,

248
00:13:12.572 --> 00:13:16.512
is, is all of the

249
00:13:17.302 --> 00:13:22.202
Middle School classrooms separated by building from the

250
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:24.682
Elementary classrooms. It is correct. So, the

251
00:13:24.682 --> 00:13:27.627
administration building houses all of the Middle School

252
00:13:27.628 --> 00:13:31.472
classrooms and those SDC classrooms and the library.

253
00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:34.572
And then the second building, which is the elementary

254
00:13:34.572 --> 00:13:38.472
school building has all of your TK and all of the

255
00:13:38.472 --> 00:13:42.942
Elementary grades and final question. Sorry. Um,

256
00:13:42.942 --> 00:13:47.922
is there any separation from the TK playground?

257
00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:52.572
From the standard Elementary there is and that's 1 Clarion.

258
00:13:52.572 --> 00:13:55.452
I wanted to make about what the show. I'll pull those up.

259
00:13:55.452 --> 00:13:56.382
Give me 1 second.

260
00:13:56.382 --> 00:13:59.942
So sorry this plate know it's you're you're fine this

261
00:13:59.942 --> 00:14:02.962
playground. That was demonstrated is the TK playground.

262
00:14:02.962 --> 00:14:05.492
The Nick parks and green and blue.

263
00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:09.212
Uh, those are just placeholders for colors. That's

264
00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:12.132
those colors haven't actually been decided on. Okay, this

265
00:14:12.132 --> 00:14:14.652
playground is the shared between the element, the older

266
00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:17.592
elementary kids, and the Middle School. Um, if we showed

267
00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:19.902
you an overview of the site, there's quite a few basketball

268
00:14:19.902 --> 00:14:22.992
courts. Yeah, you've got the play equipment and so there's

269
00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:25.932
plenty of space within there with the track and the fields

270
00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:29.512
for them to be able to, to share those facilities together.

271
00:14:29.512 --> 00:14:31.512
I just know that it's some Cottonwood.

272
00:14:31.512 --> 00:14:35.566
Thank you. I, I understand that at some of our elementary

273
00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:40.422
schools, we actually have an area for K and TK. That's

274
00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:44.642
Actually got and that is got it got its own fence and

275
00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:47.376
everything. So yep that is what this fence that's along

276
00:14:47.377 --> 00:14:51.542
here. Delineates it separates, the TK playground area from

277
00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:54.782
the remainder of the elementary place. Okay. Awesome. Thank

278
00:14:54.782 --> 00:14:56.882
you. You're welcome. Any other

279
00:14:56.882 --> 00:15:00.992
Trustee spec um, great presentation. Thank you. Um, I just

280
00:15:01.018 --> 00:15:03.932
had a question about some of the extra things, which, um,

281
00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:06.832
trustee Sher touched on a little bit. So you talked about

282
00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:09.306
the shared band room, um, because some of our older,

283
00:15:09.307 --> 00:15:11.852
fourth, and fifth graders can take band. Um, and then

284
00:15:11.852 --> 00:15:13.454
you've got the orchestra and band at the middle school

285
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.154
level, what about the music class? So at every Elementary

286
00:15:16.154 --> 00:15:20.732
School, there's 1 music teacher. So what what classroom are

287
00:15:20.732 --> 00:15:21.392
they in?

288
00:15:21.392 --> 00:15:24.303
Well, we have some extra spaces like we have the stage

289
00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:27.822
area, which I think currently is what Cottonwood does for

290
00:15:27.822 --> 00:15:31.162
their music program. So, we've got the stage area but we

291
00:15:31.162 --> 00:15:33.162
don't have a specifically designed

292
00:15:33.162 --> 00:15:36.282
Okay, music classroom, we were working within the budget

293
00:15:36.282 --> 00:15:39.042
that we had and obviously BK.

294
00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:40.212
Um,

295
00:15:40.602 --> 00:15:44.242
Was able to our contractor was able to give us more than we

296
00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:46.852
expected when we originally took it. So we we had to work

297
00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.282
within that budget to massage what we have. Okay.

298
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.172
so, we'll either need to have

299
00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:54.882
Extra classroom or there's, it looks like a flex room or

300
00:15:54.882 --> 00:15:57.882
the stage for the music. Yeah, we. Yeah, there's those

301
00:15:57.882 --> 00:15:59.532
extra rooms and obviously the

302
00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:02.692
Largely, we leave that up to the side Administration to

303
00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:05.332
dictate. What's the most important need for their site? As

304
00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:07.072
sure they're developing, I'm just trying to understand what

305
00:16:07.072 --> 00:16:09.118
they're going to even have to work with. So um, science

306
00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:11.572
would be my next question. Same thing Elementary. We

307
00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:14.452
typically have a classroom for science that the kids rotate

308
00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:18.952
to do. We that flex room that you see flex room could be

309
00:16:18.952 --> 00:16:21.952
science amenities within the class. Okay, okay. Okay. And

310
00:16:21.952 --> 00:16:26.530
then as the Middle School, you obviously, every kid has a,

311
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.082
um,

312
00:16:27.082 --> 00:16:29.262
An elective. So you've got a band room if that's your

313
00:16:29.262 --> 00:16:31.422
elective but within those standard classrooms is a plan

314
00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:34.842
that, you know, a couple of those are elective classes for

315
00:16:34.842 --> 00:16:38.322
What whatever, elective options we have at that school is

316
00:16:38.322 --> 00:16:41.007
not specifically stated out again. We went, we followed the

317
00:16:41.007 --> 00:16:44.727
Ed specs that we developed and so we mimicked it largely

318
00:16:44.727 --> 00:16:47.922
off to what Cottonwood already had. So how they use their

319
00:16:47.922 --> 00:16:48.582
spaces, okay.

320
00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:52.492
It fit within the the framework of what was designed in the

321
00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:55.552
Ed. Okay? So and then the gym. Can you give me an idea of

322
00:16:55.552 --> 00:16:58.252
this, the size of it? Compared to the 1. We just built at

323
00:16:58.252 --> 00:16:58.972
Cottonwood.

324
00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:04.368
Uh, similar in size almost we use the that same footprint,

325
00:17:04.368 --> 00:17:07.872
okay, to design it. So it's very if it's not exactly, it's

326
00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.860
within a couple square feet of what the okay, the

327
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.182
Cottonwood design is okay. And then, can you give me an

328
00:17:13.182 --> 00:17:15.612
idea of comparing that to Wells and Fallon?

329
00:17:15.912 --> 00:17:19.509
What their gems are. Yeah. Is it same size? As well as I'm

330
00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.777
sure it's not the same size as found. I would have, I

331
00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:24.802
wouldn't have that. I'm not exactly sure. And I think I'm

332
00:17:24.802 --> 00:17:26.902
not sure if Wells is using

333
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:31.312
uh, part of the York facility at times or not,

334
00:17:31.312 --> 00:17:34.572
but occasionally, but it's a separate gym. I would say that

335
00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:38.222
it's not as large if I were just off the top of my head.

336
00:17:38.222 --> 00:17:40.742
It's probably not as large quite as large as Fallon, but

337
00:17:40.742 --> 00:17:44.222
not as small as definitely not as small as what works as so

338
00:17:44.222 --> 00:17:45.572
likely somewhere in the middle. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:48.042
All right, that's all my questions.

340
00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:51.032
yep, Jessica

341
00:17:51.032 --> 00:17:57.472
Yes. Um, I've and my comments is regarding the the MPR

342
00:17:57.472 --> 00:18:01.372
theater that's facing outward. It's interesting. Um, this

343
00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:03.892
is just a comment. This is not critique at all because that

344
00:18:03.892 --> 00:18:05.992
dirty, we wanted to level the

345
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.682
Level the hill outside to make it wider. And I notice here

346
00:18:09.682 --> 00:18:13.399
that we have this embankment proceeding so it's there's

347
00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:15.376
nothing wrong with the design. If that's what a community

348
00:18:15.402 --> 00:18:19.672
and staff decides, what's best, or is it going to be like

349
00:18:19.672 --> 00:18:21.662
dirty where we build it and go? Well, you know what? It'd

350
00:18:21.662 --> 00:18:24.162
be nice if it was flattered so we can have more people

351
00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:27.618
sitting outside. It's just a common. I would say that what

352
00:18:27.618 --> 00:18:28.932
you cannot see in that picture, right?

353
00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:32.651
Now there is seating on the opposite side of that. No, no, I

354
00:18:32.651 --> 00:18:36.417
understand it is seating but it's limited to it. It was we

355
00:18:36.418 --> 00:18:39.348
were very tight on the space. That remember this site is

356
00:18:39.348 --> 00:18:40.728
smaller than what.

357
00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:43.158
CDE recommends, that we have, okay?

358
00:18:43.158 --> 00:18:45.888
Um, so we were very limited on the amount of space that we

359
00:18:45.888 --> 00:18:49.548
had and we did, um, I think the committee felt like it was

360
00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:53.388
the best use of the space. Okay. All right. Thanks.

361
00:18:53.688 --> 00:18:56.938
The only question on the gym since we just did this is air

362
00:18:56.938 --> 00:19:01.168
conditioning. There is actually just like since we just

363
00:19:01.168 --> 00:19:02.356
like everything else that we're just we're just you just

364
00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:04.708
had to add it to the other ones. I want to make sure we're

365
00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:07.348
not someone's not coming back to do that later on.

366
00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:11.373
Um, any other questions otherwise I will or do we have any

367
00:19:11.373 --> 00:19:12.618
public comment? Sorry.

368
00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:16.428
I just want to give a comment but I love the design of the

369
00:19:16.428 --> 00:19:18.918
parking and the long, I mean that like takes you right at

370
00:19:18.918 --> 00:19:22.354
the beginning. And um even though like knowing this

371
00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:24.228
community, so many of them are going to be able to walk but

372
00:19:24.378 --> 00:19:27.282
I just feel like we've just really smartly designed. The

373
00:19:27.282 --> 00:19:29.538
The drop off is going to be so much better than we've

374
00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:32.195
experienced at other schools. So I really, really like

375
00:19:32.195 --> 00:19:34.877
those long driveways that I see there. We felt like, uh,

376
00:19:34.878 --> 00:19:38.358
the proposal that when BHM gave us the original proposal,

377
00:19:38.358 --> 00:19:42.138
it had the most offer for the district and definitely, with

378
00:19:42.138 --> 00:19:45.108
seeing where the designs are. Now, we are, we are very

379
00:19:45.108 --> 00:19:48.778
ecstatic about this product project and where it's going.

380
00:19:48.778 --> 00:19:52.638
And and I think that the community will really enjoy this

381
00:19:52.638 --> 00:19:53.748
facility when we're done.

382
00:19:53.928 --> 00:19:55.648
Trustee Sharer.

383
00:19:55.648 --> 00:19:59.488
Yeah, thank you for letting me, uh, return. Um,

384
00:19:59.738 --> 00:20:02.118
looking at the, um,

385
00:20:02.448 --> 00:20:08.008
Plan view, I don't see the storm water, detention Basin,

386
00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:12.808
Isn't that required nowadays? It is um, it's broken up and

387
00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:14.888
I can't remember Juan, do you remember how many we ended up

388
00:20:14.888 --> 00:20:15.658
with?

389
00:20:15.658 --> 00:20:19.998
I think it was like a dozen little small, so, it's a bunch

390
00:20:19.998 --> 00:20:22.932
of small ones. Instead of 1, like, spread out throughout up

391
00:20:22.932 --> 00:20:26.448
in the front parking lot. I think had 4 or 5 of them. Some

392
00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:29.808
in the back by the behind the gym. Okay. Yeah. And then if

393
00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:33.888
you go in the very back corner to the West, there's a

394
00:20:33.888 --> 00:20:36.468
larger detention area right there off the field. Okay?

395
00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:38.328
Awesome. Thank you.

396
00:20:39.348 --> 00:20:42.808
Oh, and I can go ahead and make a motion if we want. Sure.

397
00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.768
Um, I I know we haven't had a public comment but I let me

398
00:20:46.768 --> 00:20:50.668
make sure I raised this right. Um, I'll make a motion that

399
00:20:50.668 --> 00:20:54.628
we approve. The contract Amendment adding scope for Phase.

400
00:20:54.628 --> 00:21:01.168
1 of increment, 1 for Shamrocks Shamrock Hill School to BHM

401
00:21:01.168 --> 00:21:08.098
Construction, LLC for 5,912 434,

402
00:21:08.098 --> 00:21:09.740
I'll second.

403
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:13.191
All righty. Have a motion and a second. Any.

404
00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:14.751
Any other?

405
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:16.491
Trustee Blackman.

406
00:21:17.121 --> 00:21:19.861
All right. Thank you very much. So I noticed something in

407
00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:20.821
the contract

408
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:24.035
That in areas of the contract, we were actually noting that

409
00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:26.561
uh, the name of the school is the boulevard.

410
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:29.811
But in other areas, it's noted as Shamrock Hills.

411
00:21:29.811 --> 00:21:32.181
We will correct that if that made it into the contract,

412
00:21:32.181 --> 00:21:34.395
that way, we'll make sure it gets corrected prior to thank

413
00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:37.028
you. And my other question that had to do with that is that

414
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:40.401
in the case is where we actually have a K through 8 school.

415
00:21:40.401 --> 00:21:42.507
We actually put that in the title of the school, but I

416
00:21:42.507 --> 00:21:44.241
noticed that we're only referring to Shamrock Hills as

417
00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:46.401
Shamrock, Hills School as opposed to Shamrock Hills K

418
00:21:46.401 --> 00:21:48.781
through 8 school, is there a reason why we didn't also do

419
00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:51.561
that the way we did for uh we did that specifically because

420
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:54.813
of the board. When you approved the name, you approved,

421
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:58.341
Shamrock Hills not Shamrock Hills K through 8, okay? If you

422
00:21:58.341 --> 00:22:00.561
wish just to add it back in we certainly can I just want to

423
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:02.331
ask the clarification because I noticed that wasn't in

424
00:22:02.331 --> 00:22:04.263
there. We tried to keep it consistent with the previous

425
00:22:04.263 --> 00:22:07.131
document. I understand. Thank you so.

426
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:10.221
All right, so we have a motion. Do you have any other

427
00:22:10.221 --> 00:22:12.801
amended motions or anything motion was to approve the

428
00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:13.491
contract?

429
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:20.061
I'll set for a vote, Judy pwani. Hi everyone else. I I

430
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:21.951
thank you very much.

431
00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:24.351
Look forward to seeing it in action.

432
00:22:27.321 --> 00:22:32.281
All right, um, next up is our public comment period.

433
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:35.361
So, if anyone, um, this is our general public comment for

434
00:22:35.361 --> 00:22:37.971
items that may not be on the agenda. Um, if there is

435
00:22:37.971 --> 00:22:40.898
something on the agenda, we we highly recommend that you,

436
00:22:40.898 --> 00:22:42.980
um, give your comments at that time, but this is for

437
00:22:42.981 --> 00:22:46.221
anything that might not be on the agenda. Um, do I do we

438
00:22:46.221 --> 00:22:48.261
have any speaker cards

439
00:22:48.261 --> 00:22:51.741
And is there anyone on? I will give another like minute or

440
00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:53.991
so if anyone wants to log on.

441
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.351
Um,

442
00:22:55.351 --> 00:22:57.381
regarding public comment.

443
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:14.201
No, 1 logging on that. You can see.

444
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:17.301
Okay, then I will go ahead and move on.

445
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:22.031
Um, next up is a resolution regarding the sufficiency of

446
00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:23.381
instructional materials.

447
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.981
uh, president Pellum superintendent, Funk Board of Trustees

448
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.741
and members of our community, uh, this is

449
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:34.451
If you recognize this item you should because this is an

450
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:38.449
annual item that we take to the board around the beginning

451
00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:39.850
of the school year.

452
00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:43.008
Director Sweeney who oversees our curriculum instruction

453
00:23:43.008 --> 00:23:46.313
Department. She will explain to you the process uh that she

454
00:23:46.313 --> 00:23:50.633
went through and uh she is here and is going to ask you to

455
00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:52.553
conduct a public hearing. So with that I'd like to

456
00:23:52.553 --> 00:23:54.563
introduce uh director Sheri Sweeney

457
00:23:55.393 --> 00:23:59.393
Assistant superintendent, Campbell, good evening. Um,

458
00:23:59.393 --> 00:24:02.933
president pelum trustees superintendent, Funk and EC

459
00:24:02.933 --> 00:24:05.453
cabinet members. It's a pleasure to be here this evening.

460
00:24:05.453 --> 00:24:08.513
Each year, the governing board of each School District in

461
00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:11.693
California is required to hold a public hearing no later

462
00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:14.993
than 8 weeks. After the first instructional day of the

463
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.633
school year to pass a resolution. Verifying that all

464
00:24:17.633 --> 00:24:20.813
students have standards aligned, uh, instructional s, um,

465
00:24:20.813 --> 00:24:23.873
materials sufficient to meet the needs of the courses in

466
00:24:23.873 --> 00:24:26.363
which they're enrolled. Specifically, the California

467
00:24:26.363 --> 00:24:28.913
Education, Code requires each district to confirm that all

468
00:24:28.913 --> 00:24:32.393
students in all schools have access to standards, aligned

469
00:24:32.393 --> 00:24:36.193
instructional materials in Reading language arts in math

470
00:24:36.193 --> 00:24:39.947
history, social science, science health and World Language,

471
00:24:39.947 --> 00:24:43.183
instructional materials may be in the traditional printed

472
00:24:43.183 --> 00:24:46.823
textbook format a consumable textbook format or in digital

473
00:24:46.823 --> 00:24:47.633
format.

474
00:24:47.633 --> 00:24:50.823
Um, the state leaves it up to each district to develop a

475
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:52.923
process for ensuring the sufficiency of instructional

476
00:24:52.923 --> 00:24:56.658
materials. And here in Dublin, we use information provided

477
00:24:56.658 --> 00:24:59.943
in our Follet Destiny. Inventory reports as well as

478
00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:03.543
information provided by our teachers principals and media

479
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:06.363
texts to determine that all students have sufficient

480
00:25:06.363 --> 00:25:07.413
materials.

481
00:25:07.413 --> 00:25:10.043
In collaboration with sight media. Techs, our principals

482
00:25:10.043 --> 00:25:13.753
verified on september 18th that their sites have sufficient

483
00:25:13.753 --> 00:25:17.123
board adopted digital or hard copy, materials accessible to

484
00:25:17.123 --> 00:25:20.843
all students for the 2425 school year. So at this time, I

485
00:25:20.843 --> 00:25:23.378
would like to ask that the board conduct a public hearing

486
00:25:23.423 --> 00:25:26.723
on the sufficiency of instructional materials and approve

487
00:25:26.723 --> 00:25:30.143
resolution. 2428

488
00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:33.323
all right, I am going to open the public hearing.

489
00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:36.413
And if anyone there any, do you have any public comment on

490
00:25:36.413 --> 00:25:39.113
line or in person at this point? I'll give people another

491
00:25:39.113 --> 00:25:42.173
minute or so if you have anything, you would like to chime

492
00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:45.113
to make a comment on for the public hearing.

493
00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:49.943
Do you have anybody?

494
00:25:50.073 --> 00:25:53.083
All right, I am going to close the public hearing.

495
00:25:53.453 --> 00:25:58.473
And do we have any questions from any board members?

496
00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.963
For Miss Sweeney.

497
00:25:59.963 --> 00:26:01.833
Um, trustee Blackman.

498
00:26:01.913 --> 00:26:05.013
Thank you very much for bringing this to us. It's good to

499
00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:06.993
hear that. We have sufficient materials for all of our

500
00:26:06.993 --> 00:26:08.223
students. So hooray,

501
00:26:08.223 --> 00:26:11.663
Um, I have a question when we actually provide materials to

502
00:26:11.663 --> 00:26:14.303
students for their learning purposes, I know there's a lot

503
00:26:14.303 --> 00:26:17.783
of digital materials but there's also hard cover and other

504
00:26:17.783 --> 00:26:20.393
consumables that we have. Um,

505
00:26:20.596 --> 00:26:24.116
Do we actually remove them from students? And the reason why

506
00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:27.416
I ask is because there's been a case where students have

507
00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:30.164
been requested to return the textbooks and not to use them

508
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.786
and if they don't they're going to have to pay for them. So

509
00:26:32.786 --> 00:26:35.498
I like clarification when we say we're providing students

510
00:26:35.498 --> 00:26:39.380
with consumables we don't and and textbooks, we don't take

511
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.329
them away from them during a course. Do we? We we should

512
00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:44.815
not be taking the textbooks away from them during the

513
00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:48.336
course. I'm aware of 1 situation this year in which the

514
00:26:48.376 --> 00:26:50.490
incorrect textbook was checked out to some high school

515
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.522
students in a course. And so it may be that course where

516
00:26:53.522 --> 00:26:55.856
students were asked to return that textbook because the

517
00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:58.928
correct dig uh correct textbook was in digital format for

518
00:26:58.952 --> 00:27:02.833
them and then class sets were available so it could be that

519
00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:05.900
course. But if you if there if there's a follow-up needed,

520
00:27:06.044 --> 00:27:08.036
I'd certainly, um, appreciate the details and I can follow

521
00:27:08.036 --> 00:27:10.652
up on that. The reason why I'm asking you is that there's a

522
00:27:10.652 --> 00:27:13.796
lot now. Digital students spend a lot of time on computers

523
00:27:13.796 --> 00:27:16.333
and the ability for them to have something that rests their

524
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.315
eyes where they can look at paper, would be great. So

525
00:27:19.316 --> 00:27:21.026
instances where we're providing materials?

526
00:27:21.026 --> 00:27:23.006
As much as possible if we could provide them an alternate.

527
00:27:23.006 --> 00:27:24.846
That's also in paper format, that would be great. Thank

528
00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:25.896
you. Yes.

529
00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:30.006
Any other questions?

530
00:27:30.006 --> 00:27:31.376
Trustee spec.

531
00:27:31.376 --> 00:27:35.496
it's a little tangential to but the consumables I know like

532
00:27:35.496 --> 00:27:37.356
as a parent every year at the end of the school year, I'm

533
00:27:37.356 --> 00:27:41.106
like throwing away big chunks that aren't aren't used or we

534
00:27:41.121 --> 00:27:44.376
taking a look at at what we're purchasing and whether

535
00:27:44.376 --> 00:27:49.055
teachers are using it and trying to be um smart and with

536
00:27:49.056 --> 00:27:51.736
with what we're buying because I know I'm always have stuff

537
00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:54.336
at the end of the year. We're just they weren't used. Yeah.

538
00:27:54.396 --> 00:27:57.776
Um we are we are re-evaluating whether we want all the

539
00:27:57.776 --> 00:28:00.816
supplemental printed workbooks that come typically come as

540
00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:04.086
part of an adoption. Um, historically we have

541
00:28:04.086 --> 00:28:08.331
Adopted, both the hardcover textbook and a consumable

542
00:28:08.331 --> 00:28:11.886
workbook when that's been the format um more and more. Now

543
00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:15.186
the the textbook is coming and what's called a work text.

544
00:28:15.186 --> 00:28:18.606
So it's all combined into 1 consumable. So that's less of

545
00:28:18.606 --> 00:28:21.942
an issue. But it is the case that we have adoptions that

546
00:28:21.942 --> 00:28:24.246
are still have a couple of years to go, where we have a

547
00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:28.566
separate workbook and we and we have purchased those but we

548
00:28:28.566 --> 00:28:30.894
are not finding that all teachers are using them that all

549
00:28:30.894 --> 00:28:34.134
students are using them because they were purchased with um

550
00:28:34.134 --> 00:28:39.066
um, taxpayer funds. Uh, it has been my directive that the

551
00:28:39.106 --> 00:28:42.036
teachers and the media texts at least distribute those

552
00:28:42.036 --> 00:28:45.586
workbooks. Not all of them will be used page every page,

553
00:28:45.586 --> 00:28:48.126
but we do want the students and families to have them if

554
00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:51.126
they were part of the adoption. Um, and so, um, we are

555
00:28:51.126 --> 00:28:54.432
sending them home even if they are not being used, um, on a

556
00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:57.253
daily basis, in each course, okay. I mean, certainly some

557
00:28:57.254 --> 00:29:00.365
of them are used even yes, not daily. But yes, bits and

558
00:29:00.366 --> 00:29:01.326
pieces but um,

559
00:29:01.326 --> 00:29:04.103
yeah, I just want to make sure that we're talking to

560
00:29:04.103 --> 00:29:06.455
teachers and certainly there's contracts and things as we.

561
00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:09.293
But um, if if teachers know, they're not going to use it

562
00:29:09.293 --> 00:29:12.273
and if we're able to not purchase, you know, we should

563
00:29:12.274 --> 00:29:14.363
definitely be trying to. Yes. As we've been as we're

564
00:29:14.363 --> 00:29:17.384
looking at, um, adoptions moving forward. That's something

565
00:29:17.434 --> 00:29:21.683
we're considering. And again the the abundance of digital,

566
00:29:21.683 --> 00:29:25.343
digital, um, material makes it an important conversation

567
00:29:25.343 --> 00:29:28.855
for us to have about, um, in terms of cost, in terms of

568
00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:32.123
environmental impact, um, students carrying things back and

569
00:29:32.123 --> 00:29:34.595
forth, all of that needs to be considered as we move

570
00:29:34.595 --> 00:29:37.073
forward. So yeah. Okay, great. Thank you.

571
00:29:38.213 --> 00:29:42.183
All right, if we don't have any other questions I will um

572
00:29:42.183 --> 00:29:44.523
take a motion to approve this resolution.

573
00:29:44.603 --> 00:29:51.054
Um, I'll move that we approve. Resolution 2024-25 08. The

574
00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:54.033
sufficiency of instructional materials. I'll second

575
00:29:54.253 --> 00:29:58.013
I have a motion in a second. Any other motions?

576
00:29:58.223 --> 00:30:03.363
Trustee pass 1. I everyone else I I I

577
00:30:03.363 --> 00:30:05.633
motion carries. Thank you.

578
00:30:05.643 --> 00:30:09.373
All right. Next is another resolution.

579
00:30:09.373 --> 00:30:12.933
Um regarding uh, proposition 2.

580
00:30:12.963 --> 00:30:16.663
Yes, I bring forward this proposition uh for the board's

581
00:30:16.663 --> 00:30:22.393
consideration. Uh on the November 2024, uh General ballot,

582
00:30:22.393 --> 00:30:25.963
it will include proposition uh 2 which is the kindergarten

583
00:30:25.963 --> 00:30:29.763
through grade 12 and local community colleges uh public

584
00:30:29.763 --> 00:30:34.183
education facilities. Uh modernization repair and safety

585
00:30:34.219 --> 00:30:40.583
Bond Act of 2024. Uh, this includes reimbursements, um, if

586
00:30:40.583 --> 00:30:42.373
this passes, uh,

587
00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:45.373
Dublin unified is eligible at this point in time up to

588
00:30:45.373 --> 00:30:48.493
about 56 million dollars worth of reimbursements. The

589
00:30:48.493 --> 00:30:52.729
timing of that would be around the timing of how often, uh,

590
00:30:52.729 --> 00:30:55.369
just like local school districts, how often? The state is

591
00:30:55.369 --> 00:30:59.773
able to sell their bonds, based on their capacity. Um, and

592
00:30:59.773 --> 00:31:03.175
so this is certainly not only a good thing for uh, public

593
00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:05.953
schools and community colleges throughout California but

594
00:31:05.953 --> 00:31:09.523
it's a great opportunity for us to eventually replenish um

595
00:31:09.523 --> 00:31:12.793
our um, Bond program.

596
00:31:12.793 --> 00:31:15.273
So this is for your consideration this evening.

597
00:31:16.983 --> 00:31:19.783
Any questions trustee Blackman.

598
00:31:19.783 --> 00:31:24.523
So I know that I believe it was on the county, just issued

599
00:31:24.523 --> 00:31:28.111
an an invitation for an October 7th review of this Bond

600
00:31:28.111 --> 00:31:30.823
measure to answer questions by members of the board.

601
00:31:30.823 --> 00:31:33.963
So I seeing upon it. I was just hoping that we would

602
00:31:33.983 --> 00:31:35.883
actually have the opportunity to actually have that

603
00:31:35.883 --> 00:31:39.363
information session first before actually passing this item

604
00:31:39.363 --> 00:31:41.943
since it occurs on October 7th. I was wondering if we could

605
00:31:41.943 --> 00:31:43.593
move this item to the next meeting.

606
00:31:45.424 --> 00:31:49.049
I have no problem uh, moving up, that's the wish of the

607
00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:49.664
board.

608
00:31:52.334 --> 00:31:57.219
I'm fine either way. Um, at this point it. What's on? The,

609
00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:59.604
the ballot is on the ballot, whether we agree with all the

610
00:31:59.604 --> 00:32:02.734
specifics that are not. Um, and I believe it's in our best

611
00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:07.074
interest that this pass across the state, um, to help our

612
00:32:07.074 --> 00:32:11.034
district. Um, as 1 that has needed to do a lot of building,

613
00:32:11.034 --> 00:32:14.274
building, unlike other districts, um, for new schools. Um,

614
00:32:14.502 --> 00:32:18.009
opposed to moving it to next time. I don't know. Do, does

615
00:32:18.009 --> 00:32:21.431
anyone have a strong opinion about passing it now or moving

616
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:22.733
to next meeting?

617
00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:26.667
I'm in favor. Um, so I'm happy to vote for today or in 2

618
00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:31.634
weeks. Um but we have 50 plus million dollars that we're in

619
00:32:31.694 --> 00:32:36.634
line for. So um, I definitely am for resolution supporting

620
00:32:36.634 --> 00:32:37.034
it.

621
00:32:39.954 --> 00:32:43.414
Trustee Blackman. So I'll clarify the reason why I want to

622
00:32:43.414 --> 00:32:45.802
move it is because the actual wording of this Bond measure

623
00:32:45.802 --> 00:32:48.214
is different than other state Bond measures. It actually

624
00:32:48.214 --> 00:32:51.934
puts more emphasis on smaller low-income communities,

625
00:32:51.934 --> 00:32:55.324
actually receiving prioritization for their funding former

626
00:32:55.324 --> 00:32:58.714
Bond measures. You should actually used to place safety and

627
00:32:58.714 --> 00:33:01.954
needs at the top of the list. I'm actually concerned given

628
00:33:01.954 --> 00:33:05.134
our current bond that we've been able to put out and the

629
00:33:05.134 --> 00:33:07.574
makeup of our district that we won't actually qualify at

630
00:33:07.574 --> 00:33:10.102
the very top of the list that we'll be passed over very

631
00:33:10.102 --> 00:33:12.694
quickly, which is why I wanted to wait until the meeting on

632
00:33:12.694 --> 00:33:13.564
the 7th where we could ask is that.

633
00:33:13.564 --> 00:33:16.264
Exactly how they're going to determine the prioritization

634
00:33:16.264 --> 00:33:18.004
based on this new criteria.

635
00:33:20.634 --> 00:33:22.174
Trustee quo.

636
00:33:23.024 --> 00:33:26.424
Uh with that in mind with the, would it change? A language

637
00:33:26.424 --> 00:33:29.634
of the resolution itself as as drafted.

638
00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:33.491
uh, it wouldn't change the resolution, it would change

639
00:33:33.492 --> 00:33:36.844
whether or not, uh, it's a priority for the board depending

640
00:33:36.844 --> 00:33:38.494
on, um,

641
00:33:38.494 --> 00:33:41.546
I don't think they're going to be they will be able to give

642
00:33:41.546 --> 00:33:46.769
you uh or anyone, an answer um, at the seminar of where and

643
00:33:46.769 --> 00:33:50.414
and the timing we would fall in. But again delaying it 2

644
00:33:50.414 --> 00:33:52.934
weeks, it still would be about a month out from the

645
00:33:52.934 --> 00:33:56.894
election. So I don't see any harm in bringing it back.

646
00:34:04.234 --> 00:34:09.074
yeah, I mean um if we can have more information, I mean,

647
00:34:09.074 --> 00:34:11.834
with the quick read I did um,

648
00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:14.224
you know, I I'd rather

649
00:34:14.462 --> 00:34:18.582
Have bonds where we control the money. I think this is a

650
00:34:18.582 --> 00:34:19.722
state bond that

651
00:34:20.102 --> 00:34:23.082
That 1's going to get very little out of the way, it's

652
00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:24.432
ridden. So,

653
00:34:24.432 --> 00:34:29.342
Um, you know, don't want to talk about the past, but we did

654
00:34:29.342 --> 00:34:32.122
have a chance to have a local bond, which I think would

655
00:34:32.122 --> 00:34:36.122
have been, uh, you know, much much more for us to do

656
00:34:36.122 --> 00:34:39.462
something with. So I I like to wait and hear more about it.

657
00:34:39.462 --> 00:34:42.242
Maybe that can that can change my mind because if we had to

658
00:34:42.242 --> 00:34:44.162
do it tonight, I'd probably vote. No.

659
00:34:45.712 --> 00:34:48.692
Okay, I'm fine moving that to the next.

660
00:34:48.692 --> 00:34:50.102
Next meeting.

661
00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:56.464
Um, next, we have a first reading of a board policy related

662
00:34:56.465 --> 00:34:59.202
to actions by the board.

663
00:34:59.842 --> 00:35:05.912
So bringing forward to you um a board policy 9323.2 actions

664
00:35:05.912 --> 00:35:11.327
actions by the board along with exhibit 9323.2. These are

665
00:35:11.327 --> 00:35:17.582
all straight csba updates based on changes to, uh, uh, Ed

666
00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:23.282
code, um, and reflecting any new laws that have passed. So,

667
00:35:23.312 --> 00:35:26.897
uh, this is a first reading. It is a very straightforward,

668
00:35:26.897 --> 00:35:30.722
uh, update. Uh, and I bring this forward as a first

669
00:35:30.722 --> 00:35:31.322
reading.

670
00:35:39.932 --> 00:35:43.152
Anyone have any questions? It looked pretty straight

671
00:35:43.152 --> 00:35:45.252
forward in my reading of it.

672
00:35:45.262 --> 00:35:48.362
And it's only a first reading. So we can

673
00:35:49.172 --> 00:35:50.772
Trustee Sher.

674
00:35:50.792 --> 00:35:54.468
I've made this point 3 other times. So it's obviously not

675
00:35:54.468 --> 00:35:57.312
going anywhere but I'll continue to make the same point.

676
00:35:57.312 --> 00:35:58.062
Um,

677
00:35:58.062 --> 00:36:02.452
I really don't support having

678
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:08.032
board policies that are already in EDC code and government

679
00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:09.522
code. So,

680
00:36:09.522 --> 00:36:12.692
It's seems to me, we should just have a policy. We will

681
00:36:12.692 --> 00:36:16.472
follow government code and Ed code and called day. And then

682
00:36:16.472 --> 00:36:19.752
we don't have to keep updating policies and everything. I,

683
00:36:19.812 --> 00:36:24.732
I really think our policy of how we do. This is fought, but

684
00:36:24.732 --> 00:36:28.099
obviously, that isn't the way we've decided to go. So I

685
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.312
just make the same point I made before.

686
00:36:32.372 --> 00:36:33.852
Thank you.

687
00:36:33.852 --> 00:36:37.012
Um I would say my my preference is that I think more people

688
00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:39.802
are going to look at something local than going to a state

689
00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:43.262
1. And so, I mean I I know I was actually looking at but Ed

690
00:36:43.262 --> 00:36:45.352
codes for for policies for

691
00:36:45.352 --> 00:36:50.300
This district and another District. Um, and so it I think it

692
00:36:50.301 --> 00:36:54.031
Shortens the amount of time and going places. So I I prefer

693
00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:57.511
having I'm okay with the way we're doing it. Um, in case we

694
00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:00.601
need to do something specific to the district but um

695
00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:07.601
Point. Your point is is noted, um, we trustee Blackman.

696
00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:10.551
Sorry, I had a bunch of notes on this and I just want to be

697
00:37:10.551 --> 00:37:14.721
clear. I'm happy to if you want to continue but

698
00:37:14.721 --> 00:37:17.261
No, I was going to just say it's a first reading so if

699
00:37:17.261 --> 00:37:20.301
there's anything else we can do next time, but sure. Um, so

700
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:25.911
couple things under the action on non-ag items. Number 2, 1

701
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:28.113
1 of the things I find unusual is there's a lot of this

702
00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:31.781
sort of like ratios of like 2/3 4 fifths, that kind of

703
00:37:31.781 --> 00:37:33.733
stuff that's in a lot of the updates that we're seeing in

704
00:37:33.808 --> 00:37:37.430
this meeting. And, um, I think it would be helpful because

705
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.710
1 of the things that we always have, is the issue of like,

706
00:37:39.711 --> 00:37:43.446
where are they? Um, are they remote? Are they in the room?

707
00:37:43.446 --> 00:37:46.461
So when they talk about present, it would be helpful if and

708
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:48.141
maybe this is the way the government code is written.

709
00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:52.121
Versus I can't tell if csba or our lawyer or this is

710
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:55.281
actually part of the code and number 2 because of the

711
00:37:55.341 --> 00:37:58.941
edits. But if we've edited it I would actually like some

712
00:37:58.941 --> 00:38:02.916
clarification after it says, when 2/3, the members present

713
00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:06.126
present meaning, which would include virtual or in the

714
00:38:06.126 --> 00:38:10.005
room. So just a little bit more definition of that, because

715
00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:12.951
the fact that and when do we Define members present, I'll

716
00:38:12.951 --> 00:38:14.871
admit I had a health concern and I just arrived

717
00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:18.867
Late. So I'm present but I'm present only right now. So it'd

718
00:38:18.867 --> 00:38:21.816
it'd be helpful. If it states that during the motion that

719
00:38:21.816 --> 00:38:24.291
2/3 that's present as opposed to

720
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:26.866
So, just a little bit more clarification on that. The other

721
00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:29.211
thing that I wanted to mention is that, um,

722
00:38:29.211 --> 00:38:32.217
At the very bottom of the first page and carrying on to the

723
00:38:32.217 --> 00:38:34.941
second page, there's a whole bunch of items that are

724
00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:35.601
crossed out.

725
00:38:35.601 --> 00:38:38.011
And honestly reading them, I actually thought there were

726
00:38:38.011 --> 00:38:40.119
better than a lot of the other language. I actually don't

727
00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:42.690
understand. Is it just that this was csba saying that for

728
00:38:42.691 --> 00:38:45.391
the updates, we have to get rid of this because is trustee

729
00:38:45.391 --> 00:38:47.551
Cher, I didn't realize that he was going to comment on

730
00:38:47.551 --> 00:38:50.071
this, but it just says that these are the things that we

731
00:38:50.071 --> 00:38:52.681
reference government code, government code and it just

732
00:38:52.681 --> 00:38:55.291
lists them so you can easily go and find them. But it was

733
00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:57.571
really clear in terms of what it's considering it was

734
00:38:57.571 --> 00:38:59.371
pretty well written. So I don't know if that's part of the

735
00:38:59.371 --> 00:39:03.559
update from csba that there's new verbiage about that

736
00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:06.091
changes. What we had originally in that

737
00:39:06.091 --> 00:39:10.341
Bottom pink marked off section or if we just decided to

738
00:39:10.341 --> 00:39:13.067
rewrite it in a different way. I, I wasn't clear because I

739
00:39:13.068 --> 00:39:14.661
actually really like, what was written in that section

740
00:39:14.661 --> 00:39:16.191
better than the rest of it.

741
00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:22.197
so just to be clear, uh, unless there is, uh, know, um,

742
00:39:22.908 --> 00:39:29.068
Policy under csba under gamut and we created ourselves uh,

743
00:39:29.188 --> 00:39:33.448
like the AI, any crossout information. Here is straight

744
00:39:33.448 --> 00:39:34.738
from csba

745
00:39:34.738 --> 00:39:40.788
the staff does not cross out language. Um, that CSA has not

746
00:39:40.788 --> 00:39:46.001
approved or unless our legal counsel uh uh has provided us

747
00:39:46.068 --> 00:39:50.568
more clean language or clearer language in their mind. So

748
00:39:50.568 --> 00:39:53.753
the staff is not crossed any out on this 1, right? I

749
00:39:53.753 --> 00:39:56.128
understand it wouldn't be stuff. I just meant on our side

750
00:39:56.128 --> 00:40:00.108
versus like csba side for example, so when the pink section

751
00:40:00.108 --> 00:40:03.072
got crossed off, that was because csba wrote something that

752
00:40:03.072 --> 00:40:05.268
was better more specific.

753
00:40:05.548 --> 00:40:09.488
That that's great. Correct, the changes in green are from

754
00:40:09.488 --> 00:40:14.318
csba and csba then crossed out the language to

755
00:40:14.318 --> 00:40:16.588
um, be replaced by

756
00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:20.183
okay, but there there are places where for example, where

757
00:40:20.183 --> 00:40:23.058
we list like special meetings emergency meetings where at

758
00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:24.158
least in the

759
00:40:24.158 --> 00:40:26.378
Second page where things are crossed out. We're mentioning

760
00:40:26.378 --> 00:40:30.378
them but I'm not seeing them mentioned elsewhere. So it

761
00:40:30.378 --> 00:40:32.778
seems like stuff got stripped out, that would be helpful to

762
00:40:32.778 --> 00:40:34.068
put back in.

763
00:40:47.188 --> 00:40:51.578
Anyone have any strong opinions? I I feel like it covers the

764
00:40:51.578 --> 00:40:53.158
The.

765
00:40:53.158 --> 00:40:55.358
it basically was just saying all the kinds of meetings, you

766
00:40:55.358 --> 00:40:57.788
can have, which I think we probably have in other

767
00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.868
board policies about board meetings.

768
00:40:59.868 --> 00:41:01.198
Um,

769
00:41:01.288 --> 00:41:05.108
these are just the things that people can challenge.

770
00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:16.408
I don't have a big problem with it because it would be, uh,

771
00:41:16.478 --> 00:41:22.698
It would be if indeed the state statute is different. The

772
00:41:22.698 --> 00:41:25.962
state statute, I think would govern. Anyway, even if our

773
00:41:25.962 --> 00:41:27.918
board policy says acts of the

774
00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:30.838
The government code says why we got to do, why?

775
00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:35.152
That's my guess. I'm not an attorney and it's referencing

776
00:41:35.152 --> 00:41:38.657
the the government code that we need to. Um, and I think

777
00:41:38.658 --> 00:41:39.618
the

778
00:41:39.618 --> 00:41:43.628
Open meeting teleconferencing is also referenced earlier.

779
00:41:43.628 --> 00:41:44.988
Um,

780
00:41:46.388 --> 00:41:49.338
I think it's more straightforward here.

781
00:41:49.513 --> 00:41:51.353
I don't know.

782
00:41:52.693 --> 00:41:54.473
Anyone else?

783
00:41:54.843 --> 00:41:56.323
Care.

784
00:41:56.323 --> 00:41:58.703
all right, if you have strong opinions,

785
00:41:58.763 --> 00:42:01.901
Email ahead of the next 1 when we come to the second

786
00:42:01.901 --> 00:42:02.492
reading.

787
00:42:03.353 --> 00:42:05.043
Mull it over.

788
00:42:05.043 --> 00:42:06.823
Before the second reading.

789
00:42:07.513 --> 00:42:12.713
Um and the next 1 is another 1 related to updated, new

790
00:42:12.713 --> 00:42:16.703
legal updates on superintendent contracts.

791
00:42:16.703 --> 00:42:21.246
So on this particular 1 uh there is an air in the agenda

792
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:25.953
title. It's referencing board policy, 4121 superintendent

793
00:42:25.953 --> 00:42:31.118
contract, but it actually it's 2121, which is the language

794
00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:35.323
that's attached. So I apologize for that error. The main

795
00:42:35.323 --> 00:42:40.693
change in this particular 1 is 1. We have an updated since

796
00:42:40.693 --> 00:42:45.103
2008, and bought, and Ed code has changed, uh, where a

797
00:42:45.103 --> 00:42:48.973
superintendent Severance cannot be more than 12 months, our

798
00:42:48.973 --> 00:42:52.153
board policy still says 18 months, so that's a significant

799
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:55.813
change. Although, in my contract, uh, here in Dublin, it's

800
00:42:55.813 --> 00:42:59.113
6 months. Uh, but 12 months is the max that a school

801
00:42:59.113 --> 00:43:02.473
district can give the rest of the information in here is,

802
00:43:02.473 --> 00:43:06.325
is just basically recommendations of what components should

803
00:43:06.325 --> 00:43:10.213
be part of the superintendent's contract. And this is just

804
00:43:10.213 --> 00:43:13.453
common practice in what is basically currently in my

805
00:43:13.453 --> 00:43:17.113
contract already. So uh it's just really this is not

806
00:43:17.113 --> 00:43:20.863
An update since 2008. And the biggest change is that

807
00:43:20.863 --> 00:43:23.533
18-month versus 12-month separates?

808
00:43:24.463 --> 00:43:25.853
You spec.

809
00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.613
Had 1 question. It's actually the last sentence of the

810
00:43:29.613 --> 00:43:32.873
document and it says the board. May take action to

811
00:43:32.873 --> 00:43:35.793
terminate the superintendent without, cause add a regular

812
00:43:35.793 --> 00:43:38.853
meeting during any month, in which a regular meeting of the

813
00:43:38.853 --> 00:43:40.623
board is not scheduled.

814
00:43:40.623 --> 00:43:43.503
So, how would that work?

815
00:43:43.703 --> 00:43:47.223
Is is like the not not supposed to be there or anyway, it

816
00:43:47.223 --> 00:43:48.333
doesn't make sense.

817
00:43:51.873 --> 00:43:53.623
It doesn't.

818
00:43:53.753 --> 00:43:58.743
I read it many times and I could not get it to Terrier.

819
00:43:58.793 --> 00:44:02.463
and um, also that

820
00:44:02.463 --> 00:44:05.523
That paragraph is.

821
00:44:05.523 --> 00:44:10.433
Doesn't take into account. The new rules that just passed a

822
00:44:10.433 --> 00:44:12.083
few months ago where

823
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:16.453
A new board. Cannot terminate a superintendent until 30

824
00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:20.723
days says that's the paragraph before it. Yeah, but that 1

825
00:44:20.723 --> 00:44:22.573
is a standalone.

826
00:44:23.005 --> 00:44:27.395
Says you can, you can do it at any regular meeting.

827
00:44:27.395 --> 00:44:28.685
so,

828
00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:35.065
the 2 kind of, kind of contradict each other, that's

829
00:44:35.065 --> 00:44:38.085
True. Um, anyway.

830
00:44:38.085 --> 00:44:41.105
I'll go back and review that last sentence with legal, to

831
00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:42.565
make sure.

832
00:44:42.595 --> 00:44:44.045
Yeah.

833
00:44:44.045 --> 00:44:46.515
I would I would just get rid of it.

834
00:44:46.855 --> 00:44:49.745
But that's, that's my thought.

835
00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:53.085
Uh, trustee quo and then trustee Blackman.

836
00:44:53.085 --> 00:44:56.085
I do it. Where riddle last sentence was that.

837
00:44:56.085 --> 00:45:02.445
We can meet during the regular meetings, but it gives you a

838
00:45:02.445 --> 00:45:05.625
way out for if you want to meet in July, like for us.

839
00:45:05.625 --> 00:45:08.825
We don't have a regular schedule meeting, so you may do it

840
00:45:08.825 --> 00:45:12.125
on that month, then it's a special meeting. It can't be a

841
00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:14.170
regular meeting. So then it says, without cause at a

842
00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.204
special meeting during any month, in which a regular

843
00:45:16.205 --> 00:45:18.665
meeting is not scheduled. So, we either need to say special

844
00:45:18.665 --> 00:45:21.101
or the word not at the end, needs to be taken away those. I

845
00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:23.540
feel are the 2 choices. If we want to leave that sentence

846
00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.295
in and that makes it makes sense.

847
00:45:25.805 --> 00:45:28.245
Check with legal, whatever they say.

848
00:45:31.835 --> 00:45:36.225
Thank you. So um, at the top of the second page, the

849
00:45:36.225 --> 00:45:39.675
The board shall ratify. Ratify was crossed off and take

850
00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:43.041
final action on my concern. I, I don't know if this is

851
00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:44.535
actually the way the government code wrote it, but when

852
00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:46.947
they took out ratified, usually the contracts are

853
00:45:46.947 --> 00:45:51.142
negotiated before they come to the board for, um, a vote in

854
00:45:51.143 --> 00:45:54.575
public. And so we're really ratifying on it, but when you

855
00:45:54.575 --> 00:45:56.944
take final action, it kind of leaves it, open to changes

856
00:45:56.944 --> 00:46:00.614
being made there and I questioned whether the terminology

857
00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:03.314
should have changed. And if the government did that, then

858
00:46:03.315 --> 00:46:05.612
they obviously did for a reason, but it seems like it

859
00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:08.489
leaves it open to somebody offering an amendment or a

860
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.755
change to a contract that's already been negotiated.

861
00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:17.257
Right. So even though maybe negotiated, uh, you cannot, uh,

862
00:46:17.257 --> 00:46:20.476
finalize a contract in closed session. So that the

863
00:46:20.476 --> 00:46:23.964
contract, and the salary has to be voted on in, Open

864
00:46:23.965 --> 00:46:27.310
Session and therefore, during open session is the only time

865
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.155
you can make that adjustment.

866
00:46:29.405 --> 00:46:33.225
so even if you've negotiated, like, if we're negotiating a

867
00:46:33.225 --> 00:46:35.745
contract say this is superintendent obviously but in any

868
00:46:35.745 --> 00:46:38.205
case we were negotiating a contract, bringing it, back to

869
00:46:38.205 --> 00:46:40.585
the board for a vote on that. Negotiate contract means that

870
00:46:40.585 --> 00:46:43.275
it could be reopened and open session.

871
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:48.865
Okay. Yes, the board has the authority to make a change to

872
00:46:48.865 --> 00:46:51.985
that contract in Open Session. Okay, thank you. You you

873
00:46:51.985 --> 00:46:53.875
won't be starting off on good terms.

874
00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:56.676
Necessarily but yes, you got that I do, but I would hope

875
00:46:56.676 --> 00:46:58.896
that we would get to the point where we're negotiating.

876
00:46:58.896 --> 00:47:00.306
You'd have that Authority though. Yes.

877
00:47:01.626 --> 00:47:05.134
Okay, so that is also a first reading so that I can come

878
00:47:05.134 --> 00:47:07.726
back with checking on that last 1.

879
00:47:07.726 --> 00:47:11.066
Special, or take out the knot.

880
00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:14.036
All righty. Thank you for your careful reading.

881
00:47:14.036 --> 00:47:15.666
Guess I read too fast.

882
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:19.416
Um next up is sexual health, instructional materials for

883
00:47:19.416 --> 00:47:20.656
grade 5.

884
00:47:20.656 --> 00:47:24.716
And Dr. Campbell's coming back up to introduce this topic.

885
00:47:24.716 --> 00:47:28.051
Thank you, superintendent, Funk, uh, president of P, of

886
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:31.206
trustees and members of our community, I'd like to

887
00:47:31.206 --> 00:47:33.766
introduce the curriculum instruction department for these

888
00:47:33.766 --> 00:47:37.971
next 2 items. Uh, they will be taking the lead on the

889
00:47:37.971 --> 00:47:40.506
health and sex head, curriculum for our fifth graders and

890
00:47:40.506 --> 00:47:44.226
then also for the board ensuing board policy. So with that,

891
00:47:44.226 --> 00:47:46.496
you've already seen her once today. Director Sherry

892
00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:47.076
Sweeney,

893
00:47:48.936 --> 00:47:53.236
Good evening again. It's uh my pleasure this evening to

894
00:47:53.276 --> 00:47:56.656
reintroduce, to you 2 of the, um, really valuable members

895
00:47:56.656 --> 00:47:59.956
of our curriculum and instruction. Uh, Team, we have with

896
00:48:00.016 --> 00:48:03.658
us a Schmidt Sani who is our, uh, coordinator of steam

897
00:48:03.659 --> 00:48:07.576
subjects and also our TK through 12 science specialist,

898
00:48:07.576 --> 00:48:12.196
Emily tosa. They will um provide the presentation and tell

899
00:48:12.196 --> 00:48:14.436
you a little bit more about our recommendations for

900
00:48:14.436 --> 00:48:18.466
adoption of fifth grade. Um Sexual Health uh materials.

901
00:48:21.786 --> 00:48:25.996
Okay, thank you so much superintendent. Funk, president,

902
00:48:25.996 --> 00:48:29.026
pelum and Board of Trustees. I'm very happy to have this

903
00:48:29.026 --> 00:48:30.586
opportunity to

904
00:48:30.586 --> 00:48:32.826
share this curriculum with you.

905
00:48:33.086 --> 00:48:37.866
So let's start with a little bit of context first.

906
00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:44.356
um, in 2016, the California healthy youth Act was enacted

907
00:48:44.686 --> 00:48:47.596
it's meant to supplement the California health education,

908
00:48:47.596 --> 00:48:51.806
standards the California, healthy youth act requires,

909
00:48:51.806 --> 00:48:54.329
requires, California school districts to provide students

910
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.516
with integrated comprehensive accurate inclusive and

911
00:48:58.516 --> 00:49:02.261
unbiased. Excuse me unbiased, comprehensive sexual health

912
00:49:02.262 --> 00:49:04.846
and HIV prevention education.

913
00:49:04.846 --> 00:49:09.636
So since chya was enacted and in fact, even before it was

914
00:49:09.636 --> 00:49:13.216
enacted, Dublin unified has never actually formally adopted

915
00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:16.056
any grade 5 Health curriculum

916
00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:22.374
so I'm going to give you a moment to read these 4 main

917
00:49:22.374 --> 00:49:25.776
points of the California, healthy youth Act,

918
00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:30.198
Protect sexual and reproductive Health, develop healthy,

919
00:49:30.198 --> 00:49:33.018
attitudes concerning adolescent, growth and development.

920
00:49:33.018 --> 00:49:36.098
Body image, gender sexual orientation relationships,

921
00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:38.978
marriage family, have healthy positive and safe

922
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.998
relationships, and behaviors, and promote understanding of

923
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.338
sexuality, as a normal part of human development.

924
00:49:46.758 --> 00:49:52.068
so the adoption project began in December 2023, with the

925
00:49:52.068 --> 00:49:55.813
formation of a 10 person, Committee of parents, teachers

926
00:49:55.813 --> 00:50:00.658
administrators and DHS students at D's curriculum Council.

927
00:50:00.658 --> 00:50:04.123
This committee first reviewed this chya and the California

928
00:50:04.123 --> 00:50:07.894
health education, standards in detail to develop a shared

929
00:50:07.895 --> 00:50:11.048
understanding of the health standards required by the

930
00:50:11.048 --> 00:50:12.968
California Education Code.

931
00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:16.938
In January 2024, the committee evaluated, the de facto

932
00:50:16.938 --> 00:50:20.026
curriculum. That has long been in use, in Dublin's, fifth

933
00:50:20.027 --> 00:50:22.898
grade classrooms and determined that it was not aligned

934
00:50:22.898 --> 00:50:25.538
with California healthy youth Act.

935
00:50:25.538 --> 00:50:29.118
Over the next 4 months, the committee took a close look at

936
00:50:29.118 --> 00:50:32.598
4 different health curricula and ultimately selected 1 for

937
00:50:32.598 --> 00:50:33.648
adoption.

938
00:50:35.728 --> 00:50:39.878
Okay. And now my colleague Gotti will continue.

939
00:50:41.088 --> 00:50:43.018
Thank you, Emily.

940
00:50:43.018 --> 00:50:47.518
The 4 curls selected for review were advocates for youth

941
00:50:47.518 --> 00:50:50.968
rights respect responsibility, which is commonly known as 3

942
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.838
RS.

943
00:50:51.838 --> 00:50:53.348
HealthSmart.

944
00:50:53.348 --> 00:50:56.338
Um the third 1 was puberty talked in the last 1 was

945
00:50:56.338 --> 00:50:59.998
positive prevention, Plus for Upper Elementary.

946
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.846
All of these options are popular Statewide and among our

947
00:51:03.846 --> 00:51:07.218
neighboring Northern California. Um, school districts.

948
00:51:07.218 --> 00:51:10.998
To conduct the evaluation of instructional materials. The

949
00:51:10.998 --> 00:51:14.178
curriculum Council committee used in assessment tools.

950
00:51:14.178 --> 00:51:17.988
Specifically for California healthy youth at and developed

951
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.050
with input from the California, Department of Education, in

952
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.877
California, Department of Health.

953
00:51:23.198 --> 00:51:27.858
Um, as Emily all already mentioned, the committee were, um,

954
00:51:27.858 --> 00:51:32.478
10 people 2 of them were grade 5, teachers who are

955
00:51:32.478 --> 00:51:37.026
currently teaching and in the past were also teaching the

956
00:51:37.026 --> 00:51:41.928
curriculum that was used by Dublin unified, um, 1, great 8

957
00:51:41.928 --> 00:51:45.978
teacher, so she could see the vertical articulation between

958
00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:53.358
Grade 5 and grade 8. Then we had 1 Administration.

959
00:51:53.798 --> 00:51:57.858
along with the instructional specialist, um, Emily

960
00:52:00.459 --> 00:52:05.209
In terms of alignment and support of the chya. Both puberty

961
00:52:05.209 --> 00:52:08.479
talk and positive prevention, plus chord in the highest

962
00:52:08.479 --> 00:52:09.529
category.

963
00:52:09.529 --> 00:52:13.539
3, RS and Health Smart scored slightly lower with the cam,

964
00:52:13.539 --> 00:52:16.083
uh, committee commenting that 1 curl, I'm shared too much

965
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:19.393
information, while the other did not share enough

966
00:52:19.393 --> 00:52:20.498
information,

967
00:52:22.159 --> 00:52:25.859
In the evaluation of instruction and materials. The

968
00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:30.165
committee agreed that puberty talk, ranked highest with its

969
00:52:30.165 --> 00:52:35.998
respectful tone. It's inclusive characters and its focus on

970
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.809
friendships and on talking with trusted adults

971
00:52:39.809 --> 00:52:44.000
Positive prevention plus was a close. Second choice.

972
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.518
Offering many of the same features as puberty. Talk.

973
00:52:47.519 --> 00:52:51.509
3, hours and Health Smart tied, for third as they both

974
00:52:51.509 --> 00:52:55.599
needed some adaptation for Clear consistent, use across all

975
00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:56.839
classrooms.

976
00:52:58.859 --> 00:53:02.814
Reaching consensus was an easy process for the curriculum

977
00:53:02.814 --> 00:53:06.969
Council committee. Puberty talk was the unanimous choice.

978
00:53:06.969 --> 00:53:11.029
The curriculum was then offered for public review for 2

979
00:53:11.029 --> 00:53:15.774
weeks for all dusd staff and Community. It was displayed

980
00:53:15.774 --> 00:53:19.188
for 2 weeks at the district office and also at Cottonwood

981
00:53:19.189 --> 00:53:20.029
Creek School.

982
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:25.046
No, further comments on positive prevention within, uh, on

983
00:53:25.046 --> 00:53:28.238
positive prevention. Plus or puberty talk were added

984
00:53:29.529 --> 00:53:33.169
The curriculum and instruction team recommends. The

985
00:53:33.169 --> 00:53:36.169
following next steps, for the fifth grade growth

986
00:53:36.169 --> 00:53:39.409
development and Sexual Health. Um, curriculum.

987
00:53:39.409 --> 00:53:43.074
Through a collaborative and thorough review process the

988
00:53:43.074 --> 00:53:45.849
staff recommends, the adoption and purchase of puberty.

989
00:53:45.849 --> 00:53:49.654
Talk for fifth grade growth development and sexual health

990
00:53:49.654 --> 00:53:53.948
education. Our next steps doing include teacher training

991
00:53:53.949 --> 00:54:00.999
which would occur in Winter 2025 and also a parent preview

992
00:54:00.999 --> 00:54:05.469
meeting will be held in early spring 2025,

993
00:54:05.469 --> 00:54:09.489
the California healthy youth act makes clear that parents

994
00:54:09.489 --> 00:54:14.389
May opt um their child out of individual lessons or the

995
00:54:14.389 --> 00:54:16.999
entire unit if they choose to

996
00:54:18.599 --> 00:54:20.619
Thank you.

997
00:54:21.949 --> 00:54:26.459
All right, are there any questions from the board?

998
00:54:26.759 --> 00:54:31.239
Trustee spec and then trustee Blackman. Um my question is

999
00:54:31.342 --> 00:54:35.247
around, um, you said that there's a ability to opt out if

1000
00:54:35.247 --> 00:54:39.279
they want for parents. Um, do they give you or do we have

1001
00:54:39.279 --> 00:54:42.699
to design? I guess. Um, a way where they know the sections

1002
00:54:42.699 --> 00:54:44.946
because you said parent. I mean, if they went opt out

1003
00:54:44.946 --> 00:54:46.898
everything that's easy. They stopped out everything but

1004
00:54:46.899 --> 00:54:49.339
that they actually would, um, know the different sections

1005
00:54:49.339 --> 00:54:49.989
so they can

1006
00:54:49.989 --> 00:54:53.154
Pick and choose. Yes, yes. Okay. So right before the

1007
00:54:53.154 --> 00:54:56.148
curriculum is implemented, at least.

1008
00:54:56.148 --> 00:55:00.190
Sorry, sorry. Um, right before the teacher start teaching

1009
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:04.564
it which is usually. Um, around April May in March, we do

1010
00:55:04.564 --> 00:55:07.228
send a letter home which is a detailed letter, the

1011
00:55:07.228 --> 00:55:10.636
curriculum consists of 6 lessons because it's a week-long.

1012
00:55:10.636 --> 00:55:15.388
Curriculum. Um so we list all those 6 lessons along with

1013
00:55:15.388 --> 00:55:19.868
what each lesson um does include again. Um, the curriculum

1014
00:55:19.868 --> 00:55:23.368
is also offered at the school site. So parents do have a

1015
00:55:23.368 --> 00:55:26.617
choice to go at the school site, go through the curriculum

1016
00:55:26.617 --> 00:55:29.772
and then make an informed decision if they do choose to up

1017
00:55:29.773 --> 00:55:33.868
their child out. Okay great. Um otherwise seem like very,

1018
00:55:33.868 --> 00:55:37.048
very comprehensive, I appreciate. Thank you.

1019
00:55:38.608 --> 00:55:42.141
Uh, thank you for the presentation, the information. So I

1020
00:55:42.141 --> 00:55:44.228
actually a couple questions when I was looking at the um

1021
00:55:44.228 --> 00:55:48.188
materials evaluation on the first page, there is a rubric

1022
00:55:48.188 --> 00:55:51.248
that you guys have developed with a score of 1 to 4 1 being

1023
00:55:51.248 --> 00:55:54.308
weak, 4 being strong. But on the second page you reversed

1024
00:55:54.308 --> 00:55:57.436
it, where 1 was the strongest and 4 was the weakest. Is

1025
00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:59.828
there a reason why I use flip them around because it seems

1026
00:55:59.828 --> 00:56:02.148
kind of confusing when you're trying to compare what was

1027
00:56:02.148 --> 00:56:04.148
great and what wasn't great.

1028
00:56:04.148 --> 00:56:08.388
Agreed. We followed a rubric. This was developed. It was an

1029
00:56:08.388 --> 00:56:12.908
evaluation tool that was developed by ETR with input from

1030
00:56:12.908 --> 00:56:16.638
The public health department and, uh, the California

1031
00:56:16.638 --> 00:56:18.198
Department of Education.

1032
00:56:18.198 --> 00:56:20.848
but yes, Point noted

1033
00:56:20.848 --> 00:56:26.658
Okay, so my next question is um so this level of education

1034
00:56:26.658 --> 00:56:29.838
for students in fifth grade. Correct me if I'm wrong. It's

1035
00:56:29.838 --> 00:56:32.394
optional, we're doing it. Because we've always done it but

1036
00:56:32.394 --> 00:56:35.538
it's not necessarily required. Is this the reason why

1037
00:56:35.538 --> 00:56:38.318
families can opt out of it or is this just something we

1038
00:56:38.318 --> 00:56:42.652
like doing at this age for a reason? Um, well so 2 points

1039
00:56:42.652 --> 00:56:45.797
in terms of opting out, that's something that parents can

1040
00:56:45.798 --> 00:56:48.168
always do at any level.

1041
00:56:48.168 --> 00:56:51.458
Um, so the same process is true for our eighth grade

1042
00:56:51.458 --> 00:56:52.338
students.

1043
00:56:52.338 --> 00:56:56.858
um, but in terms of the rationale, for teaching this in

1044
00:56:56.858 --> 00:56:59.868
fifth grade at all, if California healthy youth Act is

1045
00:56:59.868 --> 00:57:04.208
really targeted towards grade 7, through 12 actually in the

1046
00:57:04.278 --> 00:57:07.618
California state, um, health education, standards, which

1047
00:57:07.618 --> 00:57:09.878
have been around since 2008.

1048
00:57:09.878 --> 00:57:14.158
Um, their fifth grade has a set of standards that is

1049
00:57:14.158 --> 00:57:19.048
actually about growth, uh, development and sexual health.

1050
00:57:19.048 --> 00:57:22.758
So it does track with those state standards as well.

1051
00:57:22.758 --> 00:57:25.812
Okay, I I appreciate the information. I was just curious

1052
00:57:25.812 --> 00:57:27.002
because it seems

1053
00:57:27.002 --> 00:57:30.942
Very young to cover, some of the topics and I know it's a

1054
00:57:30.942 --> 00:57:33.312
interesting Aid that they're at. So it's helpful that we're

1055
00:57:33.342 --> 00:57:35.562
doing this but I just didn't understand. Thank you. It is

1056
00:57:35.562 --> 00:57:39.294
yes. And if I can just say 1 further thing um because this

1057
00:57:39.294 --> 00:57:42.042
is really focused so much on puberty and the physical and

1058
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:45.512
mental and emotional changes, you know, we know by eighth

1059
00:57:45.512 --> 00:57:47.692
grade. It's too late for many of our students. So, fifth

1060
00:57:47.692 --> 00:57:49.212
grade also seems Timely

1061
00:57:49.542 --> 00:57:51.262
thank you.

1062
00:57:53.172 --> 00:57:56.512
So I know we're not talking about at the moment, but the

1063
00:57:56.512 --> 00:58:00.592
dollar amount so you're asking us to approve, I guess the

1064
00:58:00.592 --> 00:58:02.992
purchase of these materials from this organization but I

1065
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.392
noticed in the dollar amount I want to ask. So you've asked

1066
00:58:06.392 --> 00:58:09.532
for there's $20,000 some of it is budgeted coming from a

1067
00:58:09.532 --> 00:58:13.192
lottery funds but the if you are we assuming we're only

1068
00:58:13.192 --> 00:58:18.352
purchasing some of the estimated 3, 1, 13181 13191320 or

1069
00:58:18.352 --> 00:58:21.442
all of it, because all of it, adds up to more than $20,000

1070
00:58:25.772 --> 00:58:28.512
I think I need to take a closer. Look. Can you tell me

1071
00:58:28.512 --> 00:58:29.712
again? Um,

1072
00:58:29.712 --> 00:58:34.692
what your which, uh, piece your concerned about, uh, so in

1073
00:58:34.692 --> 00:58:38.532
the attachments, there's the presentation but there's also

1074
00:58:38.532 --> 00:58:42.056
3 estimates, and it looks like they're individual pieces

1075
00:58:42.142 --> 00:58:45.219
that build on each other. So 1 cover is like materials 1's,

1076
00:58:45.219 --> 00:58:49.461
training, Etc. Um but the I understand it's over 3 years.

1077
00:58:49.462 --> 00:58:52.328
so it's not clear whether there's an aspect of it that

1078
00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:56.320
we're paying for now that we won't have to cover until year

1079
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.892
year 2 and year 3 or we're asking for the full amount now

1080
00:58:58.892 --> 00:59:02.732
because adding those 3 items up is over 23,000. So I just

1081
00:59:02.732 --> 00:59:04.472
want to ask for clarification. Thank you. I just wanted to

1082
00:59:04.472 --> 00:59:07.892
look at the um at the uh quotes. So the quote for the

1083
00:59:07.892 --> 00:59:11.782
estimate of 20000 is for the materials, the other 2 uh just

1084
00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:14.924
reflect the costs, anticipated costs of the training, both

1085
00:59:14.924 --> 00:59:17.852
the training for the teachers and then the parent training

1086
00:59:17.852 --> 00:59:21.102
The reason why I ask is because there's 1 offering of 1,

1087
00:59:21.102 --> 00:59:24.102
webinar, for parents and it's very difficult to get

1088
00:59:24.102 --> 00:59:26.442
everybody to show up at 1 time. So I don't know what it

1089
00:59:26.442 --> 00:59:29.082
costs. But I would ask that we offer a second 1 because it

1090
00:59:29.082 --> 00:59:30.928
seems like it's really important to get parents thinking

1091
00:59:30.942 --> 00:59:33.102
about this in advance and I don't know how much it costs.

1092
00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:35.742
But I would ask that we consider a second webinar because a

1093
00:59:35.742 --> 00:59:38.838
lot of families, literally, we host 1 event, and half of

1094
00:59:38.838 --> 00:59:40.972
them more than half of them, can't make it. So, unless

1095
00:59:40.972 --> 00:59:43.682
we're offering a second 1 or where they can review it on

1096
00:59:43.682 --> 00:59:46.530
their own and their own time like a video, something, where

1097
00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:49.977
they if they miss it, they can still catch up. We'll

1098
00:59:49.977 --> 00:59:51.642
certainly take a look at that. Thank you.

1099
00:59:52.752 --> 00:59:55.372
All right, and then we don't have any do any public

1100
00:59:55.372 --> 00:59:56.122
comment?

1101
00:59:56.122 --> 00:59:59.229
All right, I will take a motion if someone is ready.

1102
00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:00.650
If there's other questions.

1103
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.760
Um, I'll move that we approve the adoption and purchase of

1104
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.448
puberty talk Sexual Health, instructional materials for use

1105
01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:09.420
in grade 5.

1106
01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:15.080
I'll second I have a motion a second. Any other questions?

1107
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.970
All right, trusty peswani. Hi, everyone else. I

1108
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.950
Motion carries.

1109
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:27.120
All righty. And then next is related a first reading to a

1110
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.530
board policy.

1111
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:32.570
Related to similar instructions. Yes, so thank you. This is

1112
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:38.450
uh, the first reading of um our board policy 6142.1 sexual

1113
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:42.770
health and HIV AIDS, prevention instruction. Um, as

1114
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:46.200
superintendent Funk uh, mentioned earlier. We typically

1115
01:00:46.201 --> 01:00:49.505
look at uh changes to the law that have occurred since our

1116
01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:54.650
last um, adoption or um, our last revision of our policy.

1117
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:58.082
Uh, we last revised this policy in 2012. There have been a

1118
01:00:58.082 --> 01:01:01.490
number of changes um, to the law since that time. And so

1119
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:05.402
the red line, uh, version that you see in front of you, uh,

1120
01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:09.440
does include the recommended changes, um, by csba that now

1121
01:01:09.485 --> 01:01:13.115
align this with, uh, current state law and, um, we'd be

1122
01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:16.947
happy to, um, answer any questions you have or, or take

1123
01:01:16.948 --> 01:01:20.220
comments on, um, on this policy and administrative

1124
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.050
regulation.

1125
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.320
Trustee Blackman. Hi. Thank you. Um, for bringing this to

1126
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.780
us. Um, so I had a couple questions and a couple comments,

1127
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.294
which I'll make later after I see the floor to somebody

1128
01:01:32.294 --> 01:01:36.476
else. So in the document, it seems very clearly that the

1129
01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:40.400
we're talking about a regulation that says, or a policy

1130
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.100
that talks about sexual health and HIV AIDS yet in the

1131
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.560
document, it seems like the update has removed the

1132
01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.000
reference to AIDS.

1133
01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:50.050
Is there a reason why that happened?

1134
01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:52.280
That's correct. That is the that's the recommended

1135
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.640
language. Now I'm not aware of a reason that um

1136
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.580
specifically that the that the term AIDS has been removed

1137
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.230
from the title.

1138
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.380
And, or sorry from the doc from the wording in the

1139
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.230
document. The other reason why I mention it is that there's

1140
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:11.300
a reference to, um, HIV and other sexually transmitted

1141
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.420
infections and infection is something that happens to you.

1142
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.660
An actual disease is something you get the actual term in

1143
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.880
infections is actually an improper use throughout the

1144
01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.580
document. I was a little concerned that things that we

1145
01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.295
refer to you. Currently is STDs is something that's a

1146
01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:28.393
common terminology but it's sexually transmitted disease.

1147
01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:31.099
But when we use these references throughout the document,

1148
01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.680
we seem to be altering what is common medical practice and

1149
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.210
references to these

1150
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:39.023
These specific pieces. So I'm wondering if our legal has

1151
01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:41.351
actually looked at this because nobody refers to sexually

1152
01:02:41.351 --> 01:02:45.563
transmitted infection, that's just improper language. So is

1153
01:02:45.563 --> 01:02:48.134
there a way to get back and find out if this can be

1154
01:02:48.135 --> 01:02:50.483
adjusted because it should actually reflect?

1155
01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:52.113
What actually is?

1156
01:02:52.293 --> 01:02:55.393
We'll definitely have a legal review this 1.

1157
01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:59.453
Then my next question. Is that, on the first page, we

1158
01:02:59.453 --> 01:03:01.193
talked about there are

1159
01:03:01.193 --> 01:03:04.483
Uh, 4 paragraphs before General criteria for instruction

1160
01:03:04.484 --> 01:03:08.613
and materials this third and fourth 1 are actually repeated

1161
01:03:08.613 --> 01:03:11.273
after the general criteria for instruction materials. It's

1162
01:03:11.273 --> 01:03:13.930
kind of interesting, they moved up above it. And what's

1163
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.312
weird about the way it's written is that under General

1164
01:03:16.313 --> 01:03:19.193
criteria for instruction materials? We write these numbers

1165
01:03:19.193 --> 01:03:25.313
1 to 3 Etc, the first 1. Um, where it says our age

1166
01:03:25.313 --> 01:03:27.863
appropriate is actually in the

1167
01:03:27.863 --> 01:03:31.193
Third paragraph from the top and it actually references the

1168
01:03:31.193 --> 01:03:33.773
Education Code. So it's weird that it got pushed up above

1169
01:03:33.773 --> 01:03:37.066
it rather than down under number 1, which is the section

1170
01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:40.186
that's talking about it. The same thing is true for number

1171
01:03:40.186 --> 01:03:44.536
2, where number 2 says our medically accurate and

1172
01:03:44.536 --> 01:03:48.761
objective, whereas the fourth paragraph on that first page

1173
01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:52.433
talks about just that, but it got bumped up above the

1174
01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:56.213
actual item 2, which is again talking about it. So it seems

1175
01:03:56.213 --> 01:03:58.805
like there's been some verbiage that's moved around that

1176
01:03:58.805 --> 01:04:01.373
doesn't sync very well with what the document is actually

1177
01:04:01.373 --> 01:04:04.013
trying to convey. I, I believe what the document is

1178
01:04:04.013 --> 01:04:05.183
structured to do is give the death

1179
01:04:05.183 --> 01:04:08.957
Definitions first. So those first 4 paragraphs are actually

1180
01:04:08.957 --> 01:04:12.023
definitions of terms that are used later in the document.

1181
01:04:12.053 --> 01:04:15.503
So when it gets to the general criteria and enumerates age

1182
01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:18.623
appropriate as 1 of the criteria, it's just referring back

1183
01:04:18.623 --> 01:04:21.695
up to that definition of what age appropriate means and the

1184
01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:23.543
same with medically accurate.

1185
01:04:23.543 --> 01:04:25.613
Okay. It's just uh, from my point of view, it was just

1186
01:04:25.613 --> 01:04:29.193
really confusing to see it kind of repeated, um, a couple

1187
01:04:29.193 --> 01:04:31.453
like just literally having the definition of where it's

1188
01:04:31.453 --> 01:04:34.157
actually called out below. But okay, I understand most of

1189
01:04:34.157 --> 01:04:37.553
my comments are about things related to the not including

1190
01:04:37.553 --> 01:04:41.153
AIDS but there's also some things that I feel are a little

1191
01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:45.008
bit concerning with some references. Um for example there's

1192
01:04:45.008 --> 01:04:48.743
a number 12 where we discuss, things like maintain

1193
01:04:48.743 --> 01:04:51.683
committed relationships such as marriage.

1194
01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:54.713
well, I I there are probably way better ways to word it

1195
01:04:54.743 --> 01:04:56.504
like, that sounds like we're pushing students into

1196
01:04:56.505 --> 01:05:01.163
marriage, but, um, there's also the definition of, um,

1197
01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:04.565
affirmative consent. And number 14. It seems like in other

1198
01:05:04.566 --> 01:05:06.968
areas, we discussed what affirmative consent is and some of

1199
01:05:06.968 --> 01:05:09.719
these documents, but we actually don't use that same

1200
01:05:09.719 --> 01:05:13.043
terminology in the actual document. So if we're using

1201
01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:16.283
terminology be helpful, if we continue to use it again and

1202
01:05:16.283 --> 01:05:19.313
again and again so it's very clear. Um,

1203
01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:23.651
Uh, what's the other 1? So I'm getting down into the fourth

1204
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:25.308
page. Um,

1205
01:05:26.949 --> 01:05:30.829
1 of the things that I thought was also not accurate is in

1206
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:36.109
the fourth page item number 3, they discussed ways to avert

1207
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:39.685
avert actually um acquiring either HIV or other sexually

1208
01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:43.909
transmitted diseases, but it doesn't go in and list.

1209
01:05:43.909 --> 01:05:46.982
Everything that's known medically and I thought was a

1210
01:05:46.982 --> 01:05:50.529
little bit concerning that we're not talking about uh blood

1211
01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:55.345
transfusions organ transplants. Um and also that there are

1212
01:05:55.345 --> 01:05:58.369
actual medical procedures to prevent pregnancy. So

1213
01:05:58.369 --> 01:06:01.703
are we only allowed to discuss the things that are in this

1214
01:06:01.703 --> 01:06:04.763
document and are materials or are we talking about every

1215
01:06:04.763 --> 01:06:08.129
single thing that actually covers these topics? We would

1216
01:06:08.129 --> 01:06:11.699
look to the standards and the California, healthy youth act

1217
01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:15.939
um to align our content. So I don't think it's the

1218
01:06:15.939 --> 01:06:20.489
intention of the board policy to list every um,

1219
01:06:20.489 --> 01:06:24.329
Concept and and skill. That students would be taught within

1220
01:06:24.329 --> 01:06:27.029
the course. Just a general overview of the things that

1221
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:29.369
should be included as part of the course but again the

1222
01:06:29.369 --> 01:06:33.359
standards would govern the content of the of the course.

1223
01:06:33.359 --> 01:06:37.569
so, um, in number 4 on page 5, we talk about, um,

1224
01:06:37.569 --> 01:06:44.265
anti-retroviral is do reduce the prevalence, the, um, HIV

1225
01:06:44.265 --> 01:06:47.998
in the body. It doesn't reduce the risk of Contracting it.

1226
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.977
So our statement that says prevent it actually only, it has

1227
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.318
percentage of reduction. It doesn't actually 100% reduce or

1228
01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:58.319
prevent it, so I'm just curious why the word prevent is in

1229
01:06:58.319 --> 01:07:00.479
there because it's actually not factually based

1230
01:07:00.479 --> 01:07:03.309
So again, it's like there's a lot of stuff in here that

1231
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:05.529
it's a really long document and there's some things that I

1232
01:07:05.529 --> 01:07:08.124
find that are not actually accurately portrayed. And I will

1233
01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.449
mention the reason why I know this is because I actually

1234
01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:13.321
designed 1 of the first HIV treatment centers in the United

1235
01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:16.175
States. So, I have a very deep understanding about the

1236
01:07:16.176 --> 01:07:18.448
treatment of it for individuals that are affected with

1237
01:07:18.449 --> 01:07:21.969
this, and they're very sensitive to the use of the terms.

1238
01:07:21.969 --> 01:07:23.589
And the references, which is why I'm upset that we don't

1239
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:26.259
refer to AIDS when we mentioned HIV.

1240
01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:29.869
So thank you. Thank you for those uh, comments that

1241
01:07:29.869 --> 01:07:30.589
feedback.

1242
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:35.009
And just quickly looking up, Ed code. It does reference Cy,

1243
01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:38.439
transmitted infections throughout Ed code specifically on

1244
01:07:38.439 --> 01:07:42.139
these Ed codes number. So I think that is, I believe the

1245
01:07:42.139 --> 01:07:42.939
current

1246
01:07:44.199 --> 01:07:46.879
the current, um,

1247
01:07:48.079 --> 01:07:52.379
No 1. That's that's what's on state Ed code right now. So

1248
01:07:52.379 --> 01:07:53.399
what I've looked up

1249
01:07:53.466 --> 01:07:56.566
Um, but we can have follow-up on that.

1250
01:07:56.706 --> 01:08:00.556
Any other trustees have any other questions?

1251
01:08:00.726 --> 01:08:03.076
And some of that was the AR.

1252
01:08:03.456 --> 01:08:07.036
Not the board policy. The the comments that we were just

1253
01:08:07.036 --> 01:08:09.556
just addressing. So I were the are not the board policy.

1254
01:08:09.556 --> 01:08:11.566
Yeah. That that last section was the AR.

1255
01:08:12.286 --> 01:08:15.596
All righty. Any other questions or any public comment on

1256
01:08:15.596 --> 01:08:16.646
this 1?

1257
01:08:18.296 --> 01:08:19.956
Okay.

1258
01:08:19.956 --> 01:08:24.076
Um, next we are heading to consent.

1259
01:08:24.246 --> 01:08:28.036
um, I know, um,

1260
01:08:28.246 --> 01:08:31.166
Trustee cherry or mentioned. You were going to pull the

1261
01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:32.786

I do, I too.

1263
01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:37.226
Sorry.

1264
01:08:37.226 --> 01:08:39.364
That you were saying you were, you were doing something

1265
01:08:39.364 --> 01:08:43.456
that was the the letter. I got you letter. I item 2. Number

1266
01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:47.086

Oh sorry L1. Sorry, I wrote over it L1. Sorry.

1270
01:09:01.516 --> 01:09:04.586
Any other trustees?

1271
01:09:04.906 --> 01:09:09.296
Do that. Anything. Okay, I'll take a motion. I will make a

1272
01:09:09.326 --> 01:09:15.926
motion. We approve the consent calendar items. I j k.

1273
01:09:16.346 --> 01:09:17.856
L.

1274
01:09:17.856 --> 01:09:20.966
And M minus.

1275
01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:29.416
I2 which I guess is all by and um, J1 and L1

1276
01:09:30.056 --> 01:09:31.716
I'll second.

1277
01:09:31.716 --> 01:09:34.484
All right, we have a motion and a second maybe other than

1278
01:09:34.484 --> 01:09:35.636
any other motion.

1279
01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:41.876
Trustee fee. I everyone else, I curious all righty, we will

1280
01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:47.726
start with. Um, I2 is pretty straight forward. Yeah, I do.

1281
01:09:47.726 --> 01:09:50.696
I, I'm all set to go to the vote. Okay. And take a vote on

1282
01:09:50.696 --> 01:09:53.816
approving. The minutes from the last meeting.

1283
01:09:53.816 --> 01:09:56.736
I'll move we approve the minutes from the last meeting.

1284
01:09:56.736 --> 01:09:58.016
I'll second.

1285
01:09:58.526 --> 01:10:04.776
Trustee peswani. Hi, everyone else. I I abstain I

1286
01:10:04.776 --> 01:10:08.056
so, for your eyes and an abstention,

1287
01:10:08.846 --> 01:10:12.906
um, next up, we have J1

1288
01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:17.246
Which is the second reading of the um, new mobile

1289
01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.196
communication device policy.

1290
01:10:19.196 --> 01:10:24.576
So, I want to pull it to 1 Bank staff for making the change

1291
01:10:24.576 --> 01:10:27.816
had been. They've been requested by trustee spec on

1292
01:10:27.816 --> 01:10:30.556
silencing the phones. The 1 thing that I'm still conflicted

1293
01:10:30.596 --> 01:10:34.476
about though, however is the discussion about, um, in the

1294
01:10:34.476 --> 01:10:36.961
second to last paragraph on the policy page that talks

1295
01:10:36.962 --> 01:10:39.501
about student is also subject to discipline, according to

1296
01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:41.796
law, etc for off-campus, use of mobile communication

1297
01:10:41.796 --> 01:10:45.336
devices that pose a threat or danger to students. Um, I'm

1298
01:10:45.336 --> 01:10:49.056
just concerned that because students have the ability to

1299
01:10:49.056 --> 01:10:52.356
free speech that basically extends the board's ability to

1300
01:10:52.356 --> 01:10:55.056
or the district's ability to monitor private conversations

1301
01:10:55.056 --> 01:10:57.422
when they're not on campus. I understand when the context

1302
01:10:57.423 --> 01:11:00.936
is a, a school related activity or event, when it's off

1303
01:11:00.936 --> 01:11:03.636
campus, like, if we had a field trip or we had a game off

1304
01:11:03.636 --> 01:11:05.676
campus, I totally understand that completely because

1305
01:11:05.676 --> 01:11:07.932
they're representing the school, but when it's on their own

1306
01:11:08.016 --> 01:11:10.322
free time, I felt like it was an invasion of privacy, and I

1307
01:11:10.323 --> 01:11:13.476
don't know if it necessarily would be legal for us to state

1308
01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:16.356
that somebody's private Communications falls under this

1309
01:11:16.449 --> 01:11:18.409
Um, policy.

1310
01:11:18.599 --> 01:11:21.009
so, if

1311
01:11:21.129 --> 01:11:25.369
in in this situation we're not monitoring its if uh,

1312
01:11:25.369 --> 01:11:28.999
something happens, uh, where a student is alleged to be

1313
01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:33.029
bullied online, um, whether it's social media through

1314
01:11:33.029 --> 01:11:38.977
texts, we have the right, um, to investigate that. Um, and

1315
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.955
um, we have the right if we assume that or if we believe

1316
01:11:43.955 --> 01:11:46.488
that there is evidence that, um,

1317
01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:50.284
Uh Ed code has been broken school. Policy has been broken.

1318
01:11:50.284 --> 01:11:54.218
We have a right to look at 1 cell phone. Um,

1319
01:11:54.219 --> 01:11:58.509
Please do not. They need probable cause but Ed code

1320
01:11:58.509 --> 01:12:02.299
provides, uh, schools, uh, that that Authority.

1321
01:12:02.299 --> 01:12:05.433
So my question though is isn't that covered under our

1322
01:12:05.433 --> 01:12:07.779
bullying and harassment policies?

1323
01:12:07.779 --> 01:12:10.771
As opposed to under our mobile, communication device

1324
01:12:10.771 --> 01:12:11.858
policy.

1325
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:18.189
well, as you know, um, Ed code is, um,

1326
01:12:18.369 --> 01:12:21.859
there's overlap in Ed code and a lot of our policies. If

1327
01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:26.389
you look at Title 9, uh, that's coming up here, um, changes

1328
01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:31.759
in Title, 9 impact, multiple policies. And so um our

1329
01:12:31.789 --> 01:12:36.177
bullying and uh, harassment policy um, is specific to

1330
01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:39.948
bullying harassment. It's not specific to, uh, electronic

1331
01:12:39.949 --> 01:12:42.811
devices, and that's why it's appropriate to have it in the

1332
01:12:42.811 --> 01:12:45.588
electronic device section. So there would be possible to

1333
01:12:45.589 --> 01:12:46.309
add the specific.

1334
01:12:46.309 --> 01:12:48.739
so you just mentioned in front of the board policy by

1335
01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:51.389
actually stating like, in other policies where we mentioned

1336
01:12:51.389 --> 01:12:54.117
or referenced other policies within them that we're calling

1337
01:12:54.117 --> 01:12:56.389
were calling out is if we're talking about specifically

1338
01:12:56.389 --> 01:12:59.149
bullying and harassment that can be attributed to

1339
01:12:59.149 --> 01:13:02.309
something. Somebody posts online, wouldn't it be feasible

1340
01:13:02.309 --> 01:13:05.209
for us to just actually State what those policies are that

1341
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:07.009
were referencing rather than just saying word policy?

1342
01:13:07.039 --> 01:13:09.799
Because it's very general right now, I wouldn't know

1343
01:13:09.799 --> 01:13:12.034
necessarily what exactly? We're calling attention to if a

1344
01:13:12.034 --> 01:13:14.269
student does it with their phone? I mean, I really have no

1345
01:13:14.269 --> 01:13:15.109
idea.

1346
01:13:15.109 --> 01:13:16.339
so,

1347
01:13:16.339 --> 01:13:19.699
And then I have a separate a separate con uh, comment that

1348
01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:22.879
I want to make nowhere in the information that we actually

1349
01:13:22.879 --> 01:13:25.479
talked about. We talked about the things we can't do in

1350
01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:26.809
turning things off. And

1351
01:13:26.809 --> 01:13:30.077
I understand the reason behind this but I don't see enough

1352
01:13:30.077 --> 01:13:34.748
in here that talks about um training and daylighting

1353
01:13:34.749 --> 01:13:37.809
information that helps students understand what actually is

1354
01:13:37.809 --> 01:13:41.109
healthy Behavior using cell phones.

1355
01:13:41.109 --> 01:13:43.929
So it it's hard for a student, I think when we have a

1356
01:13:43.929 --> 01:13:46.149
policy like this that comes out when they won't know if

1357
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:48.902
something that they're doing is actually not properly

1358
01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:52.208
modeled Behavior. So conversely be helpful if we actually

1359
01:13:52.209 --> 01:13:54.849
had something. I don't know if it's augmented or a

1360
01:13:54.849 --> 01:13:58.905
document. That actually says this is better Behavior. Do

1361
01:13:58.905 --> 01:14:01.349
this as opposed to. We don't know what the bad stuff is

1362
01:14:01.349 --> 01:14:03.699
going to be but we'll figure it out when we see it.

1363
01:14:03.699 --> 01:14:06.770
So, could something be added that actually? It wouldn't be

1364
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:09.272
in the policy but something that would attach, or at least

1365
01:14:09.272 --> 01:14:12.062
explain what, or maybe it's a training session, but as a

1366
01:14:12.062 --> 01:14:13.254
student, I wouldn't even know.

1367
01:14:13.255 --> 01:14:16.543
What somebody might flag me for? I mean, I can imagine but

1368
01:14:16.543 --> 01:14:19.015
their kids. So they may not know

1369
01:14:19.015 --> 01:14:21.565
Trustee Blackman. I think that we can take that under

1370
01:14:21.565 --> 01:14:24.015
consideration and we can work with our principals on that.

1371
01:14:24.015 --> 01:14:26.482
Thank you. It's, we really appreciate it because they're

1372
01:14:26.482 --> 01:14:28.679
confused. But anyways, thank you. Those are my only points

1373
01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.165
so that's why I pulled it.

1374
01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:34.335
I in relation to the discipline 1. Um I know I have I've

1375
01:14:34.395 --> 01:14:36.687
sat through a lot of trainings. Regarding what is allowed

1376
01:14:36.687 --> 01:14:39.723
and and not allowed in terms of and I think it things are

1377
01:14:39.723 --> 01:14:43.605
are, are are changing rapidly with. Um,

1378
01:14:43.765 --> 01:14:45.575
You know.

1379
01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:49.595
uh, you know, things coming coming through various courts

1380
01:14:49.595 --> 01:14:52.345
and and what is allowed and not allowed, but I do think it

1381
01:14:52.345 --> 01:14:55.245
is important to highlight on here where we are talking

1382
01:14:55.245 --> 01:14:57.245
about cell phones that

1383
01:14:57.245 --> 01:15:01.735
if you threaten the school on your cell phone at home,

1384
01:15:01.735 --> 01:15:04.985
That is even though you did it at home, that is still a

1385
01:15:04.985 --> 01:15:07.565
threat and that is still something we can take action on.

1386
01:15:07.565 --> 01:15:09.965
And if you are threatening another student or doing any of

1387
01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:12.785
that, I think that is important to know that just because

1388
01:15:12.785 --> 01:15:14.930
you didn't do it at school. Your phone was off at school

1389
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:17.405
but you did something with your phone.

1390
01:15:17.405 --> 01:15:19.935
To another student or towards the district.

1391
01:15:19.935 --> 01:15:23.625
That you will be disciplined for that. And I think,

1392
01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:26.435
this is where we're highlighting it and and people might be

1393
01:15:26.435 --> 01:15:28.985
looking at it since it's quite the

1394
01:15:28.985 --> 01:15:33.655
The newsworthy item right now. Um, and I think that they

1395
01:15:33.655 --> 01:15:36.175
need to understand that just because you did it at home,

1396
01:15:36.175 --> 01:15:37.405
doesn't mean

1397
01:15:37.475 --> 01:15:42.135
if it is impacting school and it is causing

1398
01:15:42.135 --> 01:15:44.845
A disruption of school activities.

1399
01:15:44.845 --> 01:15:48.485
Um, that it can be disciplined and I think that needs to be

1400
01:15:48.485 --> 01:15:52.385
highlighted here. Um so that everyone's clear on that.

1401
01:15:53.745 --> 01:15:58.652
Mr. Chair. Yeah. I I have no problem with, with that.

1402
01:15:58.652 --> 01:16:02.964
Obviously, we don't want people doing threats or whatever,

1403
01:16:02.965 --> 01:16:04.615
we're bowing or anything.

1404
01:16:04.615 --> 01:16:06.975
I just, um,

1405
01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:10.055
You do hear a cases.

1406
01:16:10.155 --> 01:16:12.835
Of, you know.

1407
01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:17.719
A wide net being thrown looking for evidence of something

1408
01:16:17.719 --> 01:16:22.105
without a queer idea that who's involved. And that

1409
01:16:22.105 --> 01:16:28.030
That would do is is is you know it says you can you know in

1410
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:31.535
the are at least it says that you can confiscate the phone

1411
01:16:31.535 --> 01:16:32.765
and look at it.

1412
01:16:32.865 --> 01:16:39.685
If you have Reasonable Suspicion. Well, that's a pretty

1413
01:16:39.771 --> 01:16:43.874
broad statement. I mean, you could have 30 people and you

1414
01:16:43.874 --> 01:16:46.302
know, 1 of them is guilty of something. Well, you can

1415
01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:49.434
confiscate all 30 phones and look through all 30 phones, to

1416
01:16:49.435 --> 01:16:50.515
me, that's wrong.

1417
01:16:50.515 --> 01:16:52.317
and um,

1418
01:16:52.317 --> 01:16:54.447
you know, the way

1419
01:16:54.447 --> 01:16:57.317
The way all this is written. I know we're only voting on

1420
01:16:57.317 --> 01:17:00.647
the BP and what I'm concerned about to the are but

1421
01:17:00.647 --> 01:17:05.539
Um, I'd still have trouble approving this right now, with

1422
01:17:05.539 --> 01:17:09.007
with, with a broad net like that. I think we, we don't

1423
01:17:09.007 --> 01:17:11.617
necessarily have to get to reasonable

1424
01:17:11.617 --> 01:17:15.927
you know, to the, to what the police are necessary to get

1425
01:17:15.927 --> 01:17:17.517
to, but I think,

1426
01:17:17.517 --> 01:17:23.507
It has to be individually, targeted and not just a wide net

1427
01:17:23.507 --> 01:17:25.937
being thrown. And I've I've seen cases where that's

1428
01:17:25.937 --> 01:17:29.657
happened and I know of 1 case there that happened in closed

1429
01:17:29.657 --> 01:17:32.537
session where I was aghast at our actions,

1430
01:17:32.537 --> 01:17:34.677
so, anyway, um

1431
01:17:34.677 --> 01:17:36.877
That's kind of how I feel.

1432
01:17:36.887 --> 01:17:41.667
so just to clarify the, the language in the are, and I

1433
01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:46.155
appreciate the, the concern and the, the example, but it's

1434
01:17:46.155 --> 01:17:49.407
the same exact language that is in the last 3 paragraphs of

1435
01:17:49.407 --> 01:17:53.727
the board policy. So the r is just implementing the last 3

1436
01:17:53.751 --> 01:17:56.809
paragraphs of the board policy and highlighting the

1437
01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:00.537
importance to students that. If you're using your phone

1438
01:18:00.537 --> 01:18:04.092
inappropriately or illegally, uh, whether you're on campus

1439
01:18:04.092 --> 01:18:08.727
or not, um, there will be consequences if you are found to

1440
01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:11.599
be using it illegally, but I have an absolutely no problem

1441
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.587
with that part. What I

1442
01:18:13.587 --> 01:18:16.287
my part is,

1443
01:18:16.287 --> 01:18:21.074
Just we don't know whose fault here. Let's look through

1444
01:18:21.075 --> 01:18:25.257
everybody, and look through everything and find out who's

1445
01:18:25.257 --> 01:18:29.887
at fault that that's not the right way to to to proceed.

1446
01:18:29.887 --> 01:18:33.087
I mean the the rules are on that are pretty clear.

1447
01:18:33.087 --> 01:18:35.887
Um, that there needs to be a reasonable.

1448
01:18:36.387 --> 01:18:38.707
And you can't just search.

1449
01:18:38.707 --> 01:18:42.827
Everything, you know? Yeah, everything just because I mean

1450
01:18:42.827 --> 01:18:45.946
well I've I've actually seen cases that happened in

1451
01:18:45.947 --> 01:18:49.727
Colorado a few years ago where everybody within 1 block of

1452
01:18:49.727 --> 01:18:53.867
a bank robbery was detained and handcuffed and they

1453
01:18:53.867 --> 01:18:55.217
searched everybody.

1454
01:18:55.217 --> 01:18:58.227
That's not a reasonable cause it's because you're within a

1455
01:18:58.227 --> 01:19:01.107
mile of the bank and, you know, I, I just don't want

1456
01:19:01.107 --> 01:19:04.329
something like that happening here. That that's, that's, I

1457
01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:06.807
mean, I think that's my big concern. I assume you guys have

1458
01:19:06.807 --> 01:19:09.452
done similar training. The 1, I literally did yesterday

1459
01:19:09.452 --> 01:19:12.507
discussing, you know, when you can search

1460
01:19:12.507 --> 01:19:14.927
Student phones and that kind of thing, and it's quite

1461
01:19:14.927 --> 01:19:16.127
clear.

1462
01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:18.327
What the guidelines are.

1463
01:19:18.427 --> 01:19:21.647
From the, you know, from the state. Yeah, trustee share.

1464
01:19:21.647 --> 01:19:24.647
The guidelines are crystal, clear. And in addition to that,

1465
01:19:24.647 --> 01:19:27.407
I don't know what town that was in Colorado, and I don't

1466
01:19:27.407 --> 01:19:31.427
know the police force or whatever, but I can guarantee you

1467
01:19:31.427 --> 01:19:34.277
our administrators, our secondary administrators

1468
01:19:34.277 --> 01:19:37.967
Are too busy to cast a wide net, right? So they are so busy,

1469
01:19:37.967 --> 01:19:42.437
just just taking care of the, the school safety and the

1470
01:19:42.437 --> 01:19:45.587
needs of the, the students and the staff that they are

1471
01:19:45.587 --> 01:19:49.119
their their their investigation is targeted and and they

1472
01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:53.327
run a clean, you know, uh investigation. And so again they

1473
01:19:53.327 --> 01:19:55.867
they don't they don't have time to cast a wide net, you

1474
01:19:55.867 --> 01:19:58.097
know, there's going to focus on on the information that

1475
01:19:58.097 --> 01:19:58.967
they have.

1476
01:20:00.177 --> 01:20:02.137
Okay, thank you.

1477
01:20:02.277 --> 01:20:05.917
See Blackman. So I just want to second. I think part of the

1478
01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:10.177
concern with the paragraph is just that, um, it's the maybe

1479
01:20:10.177 --> 01:20:13.917
and the reasonable, whereas normally, I think that in order

1480
01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:16.005
for anybody to investigate something, there has to be

1481
01:20:16.006 --> 01:20:18.559
there. The term is used cause or just cause you actually

1482
01:20:18.559 --> 01:20:21.109
have to have a reason, and you may understand that, because

1483
01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:24.347
it's obviously in some code somewhere. But it's not made

1484
01:20:24.347 --> 01:20:27.217
transparent here in the policy or the are where anybody

1485
01:20:27.217 --> 01:20:30.157
reading. It can understand a student who's basically asked

1486
01:20:30.157 --> 01:20:32.497
to hand over their phone. For some reason has no idea

1487
01:20:32.497 --> 01:20:37.153
whether they can say why it just seems like because I say

1488
01:20:37.153 --> 01:20:39.277
so because I think there's something going on and I

1489
01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:41.641
understand if we have a threat, and those things are very

1490
01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:44.461
real. I assume law enforcement, there's investigation, and

1491
01:20:44.533 --> 01:20:47.137
it's pre-write, spread, and we can find everything, but

1492
01:20:47.137 --> 01:20:51.739
this is just for, not quite so clear. So detrimental, and I

1493
01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:54.075
agree that if somebody's doing something to bully, somebody

1494
01:20:54.076 --> 01:20:57.487
else on the campus that there, there's a way to

1495
01:20:57.767 --> 01:21:01.497
Administer those controls, but it needs to be done clearly

1496
01:21:01.497 --> 01:21:04.683
as to why. So, in the case that somebody's bullying

1497
01:21:04.683 --> 01:21:07.427
off-campus and use their electronic device to cast a wide

1498
01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:10.313
net to other students and something in our, our policy

1499
01:21:10.314 --> 01:21:13.302
should actually state that you're actually trans using your

1500
01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:17.067
phone to transmit false information. Misrepresentation to

1501
01:21:17.067 --> 01:21:20.007
actually harm somebody. And I don't see that in the

1502
01:21:20.007 --> 01:21:22.131
document, where it's clearly spelled out is that the

1503
01:21:22.527 --> 01:21:25.755
the person is taking is to harm, somebody else to injure

1504
01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:28.779
them in some way. And so the devices being weaponized in a

1505
01:21:28.779 --> 01:21:32.007
way. But we don't say that necessarily here. We're just

1506
01:21:32.007 --> 01:21:34.347
like, you know, if it's just used off-site. So I would love

1507
01:21:34.377 --> 01:21:36.987
it. If there was just a little bit more and I know this is

1508
01:21:36.987 --> 01:21:39.411
a first time we're developing this and so it's going to

1509
01:21:39.411 --> 01:21:41.571
need to get like adjusted, but they're just little things

1510
01:21:41.571 --> 01:21:44.637
that keep creeping up, but I think that we've just missed.

1511
01:21:44.637 --> 01:21:46.437
so, if if

1512
01:21:46.437 --> 01:21:49.927
I okay sorry, trustee Blackman, if I may, I just I just

1513
01:21:49.927 --> 01:21:53.707
feel like, um, what the reasonable, um, a trusting, our

1514
01:21:53.776 --> 01:21:57.619
administrators to make those those decisions, you know? And

1515
01:21:57.619 --> 01:22:00.487
and we and we talked to them about their investigations.

1516
01:22:00.487 --> 01:22:03.427
And um, and and, and

1517
01:22:03.427 --> 01:22:09.907
You know and and I know Mr. Funk very well and if we find

1518
01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:13.067
out that there's an administrator that is potentially

1519
01:22:13.067 --> 01:22:16.927
abusing the power or doing whatever, it's like, then then

1520
01:22:16.927 --> 01:22:19.567
that's when then we come in to play and then we have

1521
01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:21.982
corrective conversations with with our admin. And you know

1522
01:22:21.982 --> 01:22:25.147
we go back and we we look at how we are training them.

1523
01:22:25.463 --> 01:22:28.275
And I was just going to State the I mean I do think the

1524
01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:31.423
board policy says that they're going to do it. If the use

1525
01:22:31.423 --> 01:22:33.723
of the mobile device poses, a threat or danger to the

1526
01:22:33.723 --> 01:22:36.603
safety of students staff or District property or

1527
01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:39.183
substantially disrupts school activities. So I do think we

1528
01:22:39.183 --> 01:22:44.293
have specificity on what we're looking for that would cause

1529
01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:48.933
us to have Reasonable Suspicion to look at a mobile device.

1530
01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:53.893
And I follow up and add 1 thing though, which I understand

1531
01:22:53.893 --> 01:22:56.938
what you're saying. But in 1 case, we're talking about 1

1532
01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.888
student using something to bully another student, and that

1533
01:22:58.888 --> 01:23:01.528
isn't covered in. This language, it's actually calling for

1534
01:23:01.528 --> 01:23:04.453
safety or threat or danger. So, if some students bullying

1535
01:23:04.453 --> 01:23:06.933
another using their device off campus, where is that in

1536
01:23:06.933 --> 01:23:09.877
here? That actually says that we can act and secure that

1537
01:23:09.877 --> 01:23:14.353
device and basically somehow meet the issue, um, I would

1538
01:23:14.353 --> 01:23:16.993
consider that poses a threat to the safety of students.

1539
01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:19.513
Absolutely, a danger to students students, but students

1540
01:23:19.513 --> 01:23:20.293
plural,

1541
01:23:20.463 --> 01:23:25.157
Okay, okay, so we should put a parenthesis around the S. I

1542
01:23:25.157 --> 01:23:25.842
mean

1543
01:23:25.843 --> 01:23:30.449
I don't, I think that, it's, I think people realize 1

1544
01:23:30.449 --> 01:23:33.833
student multiple students, if it's a threat to any student,

1545
01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:36.143
like, that's serious. And we need to

1546
01:23:36.143 --> 01:23:38.893
We need to make sure that we're doing the right things.

1547
01:23:41.173 --> 01:23:43.343
All right, I'm done.

1548
01:23:43.343 --> 01:23:46.313
Thanks. Do we have any public comment on this item?

1549
01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:49.423
All righty. I am. I will take a motion.

1550
01:23:50.633 --> 01:23:55.173
I'll move that we approve. I've already lost which item it

1551
01:23:55.173 --> 01:23:55.683
is.

1552
01:23:56.373 --> 01:23:58.033
1 J.

1553
01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.513
Um, J1.

1554
01:24:02.803 --> 01:24:04.313
A second.

1555
01:24:04.313 --> 01:24:06.213
I already have a motion a second. Do you have any other

1556
01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:07.213
motions?

1557
01:24:07.453 --> 01:24:09.803
All right, trusty peswani.

1558
01:24:09.803 --> 01:24:11.853
Hi, everyone else.

1559
01:24:14.613 --> 01:24:16.363
Motion carries.

1560
01:24:17.363 --> 01:24:19.443
Was that you okay?

1561
01:24:19.443 --> 01:24:24.993
And last 1 is L1, is there a particular policy? You want

1562
01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:25.643
to?

1563
01:24:25.643 --> 01:24:30.453
Pull on this 1 or well. I've already made a lot of comments

1564
01:24:30.453 --> 01:24:32.553
from the last meeting. So I won't repeat any of that. I'm

1565
01:24:32.553 --> 01:24:34.893
not going to vote. Yes for this because I do feel that

1566
01:24:34.893 --> 01:24:39.393
there is a group of harms created by this specific.

1567
01:24:39.393 --> 01:24:42.563
It's a lot of policies. I'm send by we the fact that we

1568
01:24:42.563 --> 01:24:44.338
group them all together because they cover really very

1569
01:24:44.338 --> 01:24:45.812
different things. They should have been their own

1570
01:24:45.812 --> 01:24:48.822
individual items but um in discussing this with other

1571
01:24:48.823 --> 01:24:51.535
individuals who have experience working with the federal

1572
01:24:51.535 --> 01:24:54.003
government that the process through the courts will take

1573
01:24:54.003 --> 01:24:56.743
anywhere from 1 year to 2 years and eventually they believe

1574
01:24:56.743 --> 01:24:59.419
that it will be overturned. So I understand that Congress

1575
01:24:59.419 --> 01:25:02.013
has to act and the judicial branch has to act. But we have

1576
01:25:02.013 --> 01:25:04.543
to accept something. I just don't believe that this is the

1577
01:25:04.543 --> 01:25:06.103
best interest of students. I

1578
01:25:06.103 --> 01:25:08.943
Feel that it will actually sculpt Free Speech. It will

1579
01:25:08.944 --> 01:25:11.404
silence love our students. It will make them wonder if

1580
01:25:11.404 --> 01:25:13.252
everything they're doing is correct, or they're being

1581
01:25:13.252 --> 01:25:15.604
watched. And I think that, that creates a fear. I don't

1582
01:25:15.604 --> 01:25:17.944
like the way this is written. I think it's turning students

1583
01:25:17.944 --> 01:25:21.009
into turning each other in even, when something that's

1584
01:25:21.009 --> 01:25:23.223
happened isn't necessarily covered by any of the things in

1585
01:25:23.224 --> 01:25:25.264
these policies. And I think it's going to cast a real

1586
01:25:25.264 --> 01:25:28.264
strange Cloud of our schools. So I hope that the courts act

1587
01:25:28.264 --> 01:25:30.604
quickly and clean this up a little bit, but I will not be

1588
01:25:30.604 --> 01:25:31.684
supporting this.

1589
01:25:31.684 --> 01:25:33.514
Thank you.

1590
01:25:33.844 --> 01:25:37.004
Are there any other questions or comments from trustees?

1591
01:25:37.004 --> 01:25:39.584
And do we have any? I don't have any public comment.

1592
01:25:41.494 --> 01:25:44.834
All right, I'll make a motion. We approve item L1

1593
01:25:45.924 --> 01:25:47.554
second.

1594
01:25:47.554 --> 01:25:51.304
I have a motion and a second. Um, any other motions?

1595
01:25:51.304 --> 01:25:57.304
Trustee pwani. I everyone else, I I, I I I know.

1596
01:25:57.304 --> 01:25:59.114
Terry's 4 to 1.

1597
01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:05.004
Um, next up.

1598
01:26:05.004 --> 01:26:10.204
Is just um, future items. Do we have anything of

1599
01:26:11.714 --> 01:26:14.544
Of Note coming forward.

1600
01:26:14.594 --> 01:26:19.626
No, uh, Mr. Hobbs, and I did complete our first 2 Community

1601
01:26:19.626 --> 01:26:22.674
conversations around our budget. Uh, we have a virtual

1602
01:26:22.674 --> 01:26:26.034
meeting scheduled, I believe on October 8th in time to

1603
01:26:26.034 --> 01:26:30.342
provide that same presentation and then uh, the initial uh,

1604
01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:34.154
survey response from all stakeholders to the board uh at

1605
01:26:34.154 --> 01:26:36.084
the first October board meeting.

1606
01:26:36.084 --> 01:26:37.514
um,

1607
01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:44.054
and then uh we currently have um a um survey out around The

1608
01:26:44.054 --> 01:26:48.236
Graduate profile and that graduate profile for a first

1609
01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:51.717
discussion with the board will also come uh at the second

1610
01:26:51.717 --> 01:26:55.008
board meeting in October. Uh everything else is pretty

1611
01:26:55.008 --> 01:26:55.963
standard.

1612
01:26:58.654 --> 01:27:00.254
Trustee Terrier.

1613
01:27:00.504 --> 01:27:06.364
I apologize. Um, I know several meetings ago probably last

1614
01:27:06.364 --> 01:27:07.054
spring.

1615
01:27:07.144 --> 01:27:12.669
But we uh made those new dates for the December meeting.

1616
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:15.133
Especially that special 1 we had to do.

1617
01:27:15.134 --> 01:27:19.134
And I was supposed to go back to my work, calendar and

1618
01:27:19.134 --> 01:27:21.902
Adam, and something happened and I never did. Can I get

1619
01:27:21.902 --> 01:27:23.354
those dates again?

1620
01:27:23.734 --> 01:27:27.483
I think it's December 3rd and something else or something,

1621
01:27:27.483 --> 01:27:29.803
but I don't recall.

1622
01:27:29.804 --> 01:27:32.794
So, if you could email those to me or something, be great,

1623
01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:33.844
thank you.

1624
01:27:36.224 --> 01:27:39.174
All righty. Then I'll take uh trustee reports

1625
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:44.365
Sure I was able to attend um 1 of the budget meetings last

1626
01:27:44.365 --> 01:27:48.565
week at Dublin, High School um and um was great to see our

1627
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.967
community. Um come out and um engage on this topic that's

1628
01:27:52.975 --> 01:27:56.815
going to be really important for, um, the community and for

1629
01:27:56.815 --> 01:27:59.148
and for the board over the next school year, um, or over

1630
01:27:59.252 --> 01:28:02.739
current school year. Um, I also um, was able to go to the

1631
01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:06.940
the Wells PFC meeting last week and speak as a trustee, um,

1632
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:10.240
um, about a lot of different things affecting Wells. And,

1633
01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.488
um, but we did talk about money and budget, um, and

1634
01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:16.899
appreciate the parents inviting me to that. And then, uh,

1635
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.405
finally just thanks to, uh, president pelum when she talks

1636
01:28:20.405 --> 01:28:24.279
about our op. Um, I had a work event was unable to attend,

1637
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.080
so I appreciate you attending in my place last week or week

1638
01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:27.760
before.

1639
01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:34.415
Thank you. So um I did send 1 of our first superintendent

1640
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:36.807
Council meetings, and it was really lovely to finally, get

1641
01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.432
to see all of our wonderful volunteers, collaborating, and

1642
01:28:39.432 --> 01:28:42.829
contributing and sharing. Um, 1 thing that I realized that

1643
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:46.130
came out of it, um, that subsequent meetings actually came

1644
01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:50.018
out, is that I don't know if we actually have an, I, I

1645
01:28:50.018 --> 01:28:50.900
realize we

1646
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:57.810
Fresh past, um, future items, but or actually item 01. Um,

1647
01:28:57.825 --> 01:29:00.707
and I felt that we probably need to have some sort of a

1648
01:29:00.707 --> 01:29:03.569
discussion. I don't know if it's policy but related to

1649
01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:07.880
staff involvement, um, private organizations nonprofits,

1650
01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.168
because it seems like there's a lot of fuzzy lines right

1651
01:29:10.168 --> 01:29:13.279
now. And I don't think that staff have really good

1652
01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:16.400
information to understand when they step in and when they

1653
01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.160
step out of these organizations and I think it'd be good to

1654
01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.920
to protect them. So if that's possible, I'd like that to be

1655
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.104
follow-up to that discussion. Um, I also attended the first

1656
01:29:27.104 --> 01:29:29.240
as superintendent Funk mentioned the community budget

1657
01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.460
meeting that was at Emerald. I attended as a parent, but I

1658
01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.200
will share that. There's a lot of really important

1659
01:29:33.237 --> 01:29:35.936
information. I hope that our community contributes. I will

1660
01:29:35.936 --> 01:29:39.056
make the comment that I repeated both to, um, assistant

1661
01:29:39.056 --> 01:29:42.140
superintendent, Chris Hobbs, along with superintendent Funk

1662
01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.430
that the um,

1663
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:47.264
That the polling needs to actually be separated into

1664
01:29:47.264 --> 01:29:50.840
families and staff so that we can actually understand where

1665
01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.540
the feedback is coming from. So I hope that happens in the

1666
01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:54.860
future. Thank you.

1667
01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:00.740
Trustee Cher. No report Mercy quote.

1668
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:04.480
I was just quickly that I did attend, uh,

1669
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.540
The town hall meeting at ehsl EHS last week and I do

1670
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.700

Um, things I have to be discussed.

1675
01:30:22.913 --> 01:30:26.558

Upcoming possible cuts and and help us make the decision on

01:30:32.923 --> 01:30:34.373
that. Thank you.

1679
01:30:35.353 --> 01:30:39.113
Alrighty, as trustee Speck mentioned, I performed my

1680
01:30:39.113 --> 01:30:41.213
alternate duties and went to the row meeting, which is

1681
01:30:41.213 --> 01:30:44.873
always enjoyable. Um, there was some great reports over

1682
01:30:44.873 --> 01:30:47.813
what happened over summer or some really great. Um, summer

1683
01:30:47.813 --> 01:30:51.027
camps through, Lotus like Atlas Positas College, but

1684
01:30:51.027 --> 01:30:54.112
through some Workforce grants. Um, they had students from

1685
01:30:54.113 --> 01:30:57.413
all 6, comprehensive high schools in the 3 cities.

1686
01:30:57.413 --> 01:31:03.573
um a lot of um, you know, drones there was a girls in stem

1687
01:31:03.573 --> 01:31:05.733
1, there's some great stuff and some really

1688
01:31:05.733 --> 01:31:07.073
um,

1689
01:31:07.073 --> 01:31:10.523
great things. Um, they got another round of Grants and

1690
01:31:10.523 --> 01:31:13.103
we'll be continuing those summer ones with a focus towards

1691
01:31:13.103 --> 01:31:14.933
Green Technology moving forward.

1692
01:31:14.933 --> 01:31:18.553
Um, so that will kind of be the similar type ones. Um,

1693
01:31:18.553 --> 01:31:22.063
they've been really successful and some really amazing, um,

1694
01:31:22.063 --> 01:31:26.603
Um, offerings, um, and so it's, it's great to to see that

1695
01:31:26.603 --> 01:31:29.940
work that's being done. Um, so that was kind of the main

1696
01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.242
thing, um, that was reported on over summer and then

1697
01:31:34.243 --> 01:31:36.754
they're just moving forward with, um, everything and, and

1698
01:31:36.754 --> 01:31:37.462
really

1699
01:31:37.463 --> 01:31:40.431
Being reflective of, you know, what, programs or what at

1700
01:31:40.431 --> 01:31:43.523
what schools, and helping to make a, as robust of a program

1701
01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:45.380
as possible. And I think it really does reach so many of

1702
01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.902
our students, um, throughout the tri valley and, and really

1703
01:31:47.903 --> 01:31:51.748
helping support, um, career awareness, and things like

1704
01:31:51.748 --> 01:31:52.412
that.

1705
01:31:52.413 --> 01:31:56.463
um, and then last night, we also had our um, Sula meeting

1706
01:31:56.463 --> 01:32:01.693
Um and that was just um kind of moving forward budget. Um,

1707
01:32:01.693 --> 01:32:04.433
Um, there and then just kind of working out working out

1708
01:32:04.433 --> 01:32:07.933
some things between the districts as we, um, move forward.

1709
01:32:07.933 --> 01:32:10.543
Um, but um,

1710
01:32:10.543 --> 01:32:13.313
We've had a really great collaborative relationship with

1711
01:32:13.313 --> 01:32:15.938
Pleasanton in particular regarding um our counseling

1712
01:32:15.938 --> 01:32:17.183
enriched classes.

1713
01:32:17.183 --> 01:32:20.843
Um and look forward to continuing that. Um and had some

1714
01:32:20.843 --> 01:32:22.223
discussion regarding that.

1715
01:32:22.223 --> 01:32:26.403
Um but otherwise um budget there looked good moving

1716
01:32:26.403 --> 01:32:27.903
forward, um,

1717
01:32:27.903 --> 01:32:30.623
And someone will need to take that 1 over. It's a it's a

1718
01:32:30.623 --> 01:32:33.783
great meeting. It's a good work that they do. So um,

1719
01:32:33.783 --> 01:32:34.593
hopefully

1720
01:32:34.593 --> 01:32:39.150
1 of the new trustees um will step in on that 1 because

1721
01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:43.552
it's a really important important voice that we um as the

1722
01:32:43.553 --> 01:32:45.623
tri valley um group

1723
01:32:45.623 --> 01:32:47.793
You know that we have our voice at the table there.

1724
01:32:48.053 --> 01:32:51.513
Um, and that is all I have for right now. Um,

1725
01:32:51.513 --> 01:32:52.623

1726
01:32:52.813 --> 01:32:56.873
