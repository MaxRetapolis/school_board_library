Meeting : Sep 10, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Discussion, Information
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
DUSD staff is bringing the Mobile Communication Devices BP/AR to the DUSD Board of Trustees for their

detrimental to students mental health and social skills by promoting cyberbullying and increasing levels of 
student anxiety, depression, and suicide.
Ed Code Section 48901.7 authorizes the governing board to regulate the student's use of phones, 
smartphones, and any other electronic devices in the classroom. Previously, this has been left to the site 
administrator's discretion.BP and AR 5131.8, Mobile Communication Devices will create guidelines on student 
phone use for the district as a whole. 
The drafted policy has been developed in conjunction with the District Technology Committee, utilizing CSBA 
recommended language. The policy has also been reviewed by the Superintendent's Cabinet, which includes 
school principals and DTA representation. Input from these stakeholders has also been incorporated into the 
documents. 
The policy and regulation are being presented for a first reading; it is anticipated that approval for the policy 
will be sought at an upcoming board meeting. Approval for the regulation is not required.

Type : Discussion, Presentation
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
It is good governance practice for districts to regularly review and update Board Policies (BPs) and 
Administrative Regulations (ARs) to reflect current laws and local practices.
In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released revised regulations that support the implementation 
of Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in publicly funded education programs and activities. As 
part of the ongoing effort to update the board policy manual, Human Resources has identified needed updates 
to the various policies and regulations that are related to and supportive of the mandate.
What is Title IX?
Title IX is a federal law that was passed in 1972 to protect students and employees in educational settings 
from sex discrimination. It applies to anyone, regardless of their gender identity, sex, or gender expression, 
and protects against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, and sex characteristics. Title 
IX also protects against sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual 
favors, and sexual violence.
The attached "Title IX Board Policies Update" highlights the key updates and essential highlights of the 
policies and procedures being brought to the Board for consideration.
In total, ten BP/ARs will be updated, based on CSBA recommendations, due to the new 2024 Title IX 
regulations.
New Board Policies/Administrative Regulations:
AR 4119.13/4219.13/4319.13: 2024 Title IX Sex Discrimination Grievance Procedures (Staff)
2024 Title IX Sex Discrimination Grievance Procedures (Students) AR 5145.72: 
Updated Board Policies/Administrative Regulations:
BP 0410: Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities
BP/AR 1312.3: Uniform Complaint Procedures
BP/AR 4030: Nondiscrimination in Employment
BP 4033: Lactation Accommodation
BP/AR 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment 
BP/AR 5145.3: Nondiscrimination/Harassment
BP/AR 5145.7: Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment (retitled)
BP 5146: Married/Pregnant/Parenting Students
These are presented for a first reading. It is anticipated that the policies will be brought to the next board 
meeting for a second reading and adoption.

Filling Vacancies; Approval of Bylaw
Meeting : Sep 10, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Action (Consent), Information
Fiscal Impact : No
Recommended Action : Staff recommends approval of revised Board Bylaw 
9223, Filling Vacancies, as presented.
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
CSBA recently issued updated policy language for Bylaw 9223, Filling Vacancies, to reflect new law (AB 1326, 
2023), which requires that the notice of a provisional appointment be posted on the district's website. 
Additionally, the bylaw language has been updated to (1) focus on filling a vacancy by appointment rather than 
special election, (2) enable the Governing Board to approve, by resolution, the procedures for selecting the 
person to be provisionally appointed to fill the vacancy, and (3) explain how long an appointed Board member 
may serve. In addition, the bylaw has been updated for clarity, precision, organization, and consistency.
At the August 13, 2024 board meeting, staff presented a draft of the revised bylaw reflecting these changes, 
and input was provided to staff on refinements to the language. At the August 27, 2024 board meeting, a 
revised bylaw was presented to the Board, and additional changes were requested. In preparing the newly 
revised draft for board approval, for the sake of clarity, staff has assumed acceptance of the previously 
presented changes, and has indicated the newest refinements in redline form.
The revised draft is presented for approval and adoption.

BACKGROUND:
It is a good governance practice for districts to regularly review and update Board Policies (BPs) and 
Administrative Regulations (ARs) to reflect current laws and local practices.
Updates are necessary to referencenew Senate Bill (SB) 533, 2023 language requiring that districts establish, 
implement, and maintain a workplace violence prevention plan (WVPP) effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, 
new ARs include provisions for the Department of Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety and 
Health to prohibit entry into a place of employment when,in its opinion, the place of employment exposes 
employees to an imminent hazard.

BP4157/4257/4357 Employee Safety
