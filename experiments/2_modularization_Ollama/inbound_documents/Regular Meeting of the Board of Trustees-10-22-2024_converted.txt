Subject : 5. Contract with Caltronics Business Systems
Meeting : Oct 22, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Action (Consent)
Fiscal Impact : Yes
Dollar Amount : $197,538.88
Budgeted : Yes
Budget Source : General Funds
Recommended Action : Staff recommends the approval of the contract with 
Caltronics Business Systems to replace aging copiers, for 
approximately $197,539.
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
As copiers age, they require more frequent maintenance and repairs. Such is the case with sixteen copiers 
located in teachers workrooms at various school sites. These machines were installed in January 2018, after 
the board approved the purchase of district-wide copiers on November 14, 2017. Combined, these units have 
produced over 64 million copies.
Per PCC 20118, if there is an existing contract between a public corporation or agency and a vendor for the 
lease or purchase of personal property, a school district may authorize the lease or purchase of personal 
property directly from the vendor by contract, lease, requisition or purchase order and make payments to the 
vendor under the same terms that are available to the public corporation or agency under contract.
The purchase and installation of the units will also reduce the per-copy maintenance cost from $0.0047 to $.
00428, a rate that will not increase for the next five years. With this lower rate, the estimated annual savings 
on the maintenance for the new copiers is $4,304. The identified fiscal impact of $197,538.88 is the cost of the 
new copiers less one year's savings under the new maintenance pricing.
Staff recommends the approval of the contract with Caltronics Business Systems to replace the sixteen 
copiers utilizing the Association of Educational Purchasing Agencies (AEPA) contract #021-C awarded to 
Konica Minolta.

Subject : 6. Change Order #1 for the Fallon MS Sports Field 
Renovation Project with McGuire and Hester
Meeting : Oct 22, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of Trustees
Type : Action (Consent)
Fiscal Impact : Yes
Dollar Amount : $108,765.20
Budgeted : Yes
Budget Source : Deferred Maintenance Fund - 140
Recommended Action : Staff recommends the approval of Change Order #1 for 
the Fallon MS Sports Field Renovation Project with 
McGuire and Hester, for approximately $108,753.
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
On August 13, 2024, the Board of Trustees approved the contract with McGuire and Hester for the Fallon 
Middle School Sports Field Renovation Project (Bid 24/25-103) in the amount of $485,000.
Work on the project commenced on September 9, 2024. During the course of the work, the contractor 
encountered an unforeseen field condition on the north side of the sports track, affecting approximately 22,000 
square feet. A layer of filter fabric was discovered at a depth of 1 to 2 inches beneath the surface. In order to 
address this condition and finish the project, a change order is necessitated to remove the existing material 
and to re-grade and install the new material.
PCC 20118.4 allows for the governing board of a school district to authorize any change or alteration of a 
contract for reconstruction or rehabilitation work, if the cost does not exceed 25 percent of the original contract 
price, without the formality of securing bids, and the change or alteration is necessary and integral part of the 
work under the contract and the taking of the bids would delay the completion of the contract.
Original Contract Price: $485,000.00
Change Order #1 $108,765.20
Adjusted Contract Price: $593,765.20
Staff recommends the approval of Change Order #1 for the Fallon MS Sports Field Renovation Project with 
McGuire and Hester, in the amount of $108,752.20.
