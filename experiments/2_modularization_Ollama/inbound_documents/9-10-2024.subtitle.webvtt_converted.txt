the h building interior. Hallways were painted and stair

157
00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:29.275
rails as well.

158
00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:34.456
Valley Valley High. We installed a new office wall for

159
00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:37.546
privacy for conferences and meetings with students.

160
00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:44.396
York Learning Center. We installed VCT Tile in the main

161
00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:46.636
entrance to the gym and the day room.

162
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.786
Also, York Learning Center, adult roof, had a roof that

163
00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:53.946
really need to be replaced. That was also taking care of

164
00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:54.936
the summer as well.

165
00:08:56.576 --> 00:09:00.316
York Learning Center. Also had all the siding replaced on

166
00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:02.196
the portable classrooms.

167
00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:08.776
Neilson had a new Ada ramp installed as well for access to

168
00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:10.026
the front of the school.

169
00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:20.086
Dublin. High School. We uh put a roof on to the band room.

170
00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:23.706
We also restripe the parking lots.

171
00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:28.340
Concrete was poured outside, the boardroom here at the

172
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.195
district office this summer and a portable sighting over in

173
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.866
other parking lot. With all our Portables, I had siding

174
00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:36.446
replace repainted refinished as well as the ramps.

175
00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:43.886
Total cost of summer summer, projects of 1.6 million.

176
00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:51.196
Here's some of our continuing project, Focus.

177
00:09:51.356 --> 00:09:52.806
Sorry.

178
00:10:00.646 --> 00:10:02.876
I'd like to add.

179
00:10:02.886 --> 00:10:05.866
Real briefly, sodium apartment, cleaned, approximately

180
00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:10.606
1,444 square foot of classrooms offices. Nprs and

181
00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:12.136
restrooms. Districtwide.

182
00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:15.776
As well as cleaning after all summer school programs.

183
00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:23.508
Grounds Department, nature cleanup and uh safety hazard

184
00:10:23.508 --> 00:10:26.256
removal. And next to Nielsen, as we do own the property

185
00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:27.396
next to the creek.

186
00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:31.752
Dhy Murray and DHS had tree pruning and Coleman Fallon

187
00:10:31.752 --> 00:10:33.792
landscape and mulching was installed.

188
00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:38.872
Um, DHS all landscaped areas had Renovations made to them.

189
00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:44.012
And there are many more projects that we did not list.

190
00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:46.052
Here, we have about approximately 30 to 35 more projects

191
00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:49.797
but for time's sake, we're going to cut a little short

192
00:10:49.798 --> 00:10:53.372
here. I will if you would like I would send you all of our

193
00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:55.442
other projects to the board if you'd like to see them.

194
00:10:55.802 --> 00:10:57.762
Is there any questions?

195
00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:00.572
I see that would be great if you could send it to. This is

196
00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:02.672
great. It's nice to see all the all the little things that

197
00:11:02.672 --> 00:11:04.772
really do help make a difference on all of our campuses and

198
00:11:04.772 --> 00:11:08.072
see that the broad reach that you guys are able to to get

199
00:11:08.072 --> 00:11:11.912
across our campus, our school campuses, so that they we're

200
00:11:11.912 --> 00:11:15.032
welcome and ready for to start the school year, trustee

201
00:11:15.032 --> 00:11:17.072
Blackman, your question. I just want to thank you for all

202
00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:19.712
the work that you do, and I thank thank you for actually

203
00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:22.382
coming with your team. I know just coming over and

204
00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:24.092
introducing yourself but it's really nice to actually see

205
00:11:24.152 --> 00:11:27.952
you here. Um, I realized it's a really large district and

206
00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:30.772
it's growing, but it's so important to make the

207
00:11:30.772 --> 00:11:32.992
environments feel welcome when students come back to

208
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
campus. And so, it's really important. The work that you

209
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.292
do. Thank you so very much and for presenting this to us

210
00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:39.332
today. Absolutely. Thank you.

211
00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:44.392
Thank you, everyone. Well, Tim, uh, the speed signs that

212
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.242
were added to the 2 schools were they added because they

213
00:11:47.242 --> 00:11:50.712
were missing or they're brand new. Uh, they were missing

214
00:11:50.712 --> 00:11:51.582
and

215
00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:53.605
people were not really paying attention. What was written

216
00:11:53.606 --> 00:11:56.252
on the ground here and there. So we decided to put them up

217
00:11:56.252 --> 00:11:59.420
and said, so do we have those at all the sites? Uh, I can

218
00:11:59.432 --> 00:12:01.985
get that answer for you. I'm not sure. But if not, I think

219
00:12:01.986 --> 00:12:05.120
we should add them to each site absolutely. Um, throughout

220
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.532
the year when when you guys have the chance to do that,

221
00:12:07.532 --> 00:12:10.079
absolutely. But we should be consistent. Absolutely. Thank

222
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.752
you. All right, thank you, everyone. All right, thank you.

223
00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:13.922
Thank you. See your team.

224
00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:15.292
Thanks everyone.

225
00:12:16.732 --> 00:12:19.412
All righty. Next up.

226
00:12:19.412 --> 00:12:24.352
We have Mr. Hobbs with the UN audited actuals,

227
00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:29.162
All right, good evening again. Thank you.

228
00:12:30.882 --> 00:12:34.672
If you can get that presentation up, thank you so much.

229
00:12:35.742 --> 00:12:38.972
All right. So tonight we are at that point in our pin wheel

230
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.512
where I'm only showing you 1. First of all, because tonight

231
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:44.602
we're only talking about the year that's already ended the

232
00:12:44.602 --> 00:12:46.522
2324 budget cycle.

233
00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:50.022
And we have completed the work necessary to close our books

234
00:12:50.022 --> 00:12:53.022
for the year. Um, this is actually a pretty huge effort

235
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:56.422
that involves not only my fiscal Services team but also a

236
00:12:56.652 --> 00:13:00.882
work from our uh sites and departments to ensure that we've

237
00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:04.062
closed out all of our purchase orders correctly, determine

238
00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:08.262
what? Purchase orders. We're truly done and paid off what

239
00:13:08.262 --> 00:13:09.282
purchase order still had outstanding in.

240
00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:12.136
Voices what we're rolling forward to the new year. So

241
00:13:12.137 --> 00:13:14.702
there's quite a bit of work to be done to clean up and

242
00:13:14.702 --> 00:13:17.282
close the books each year. But we're now at that point

243
00:13:17.282 --> 00:13:20.882
where we actually know how the year ended, um, and that's

244
00:13:20.882 --> 00:13:23.162
what we're going to report out on tonight. Um,

245
00:13:23.162 --> 00:13:26.922
the general fund remains solvent as we projected when we

246
00:13:26.922 --> 00:13:29.222
talked about, uh, how we were going to end the books when

247
00:13:29.222 --> 00:13:32.357
we presented the estimated actuals along with the budget

248
00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:33.452
back in May

249
00:13:33.452 --> 00:13:36.662
Um, the total ending balance for the general fund is 31.9

250
00:13:36.662 --> 00:13:40.952
million and you can see how that gets broken out. Um I did

251
00:13:40.952 --> 00:13:44.892
misalign on this there is a uh 1 line item for prepaid

252
00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:48.932
expenses. Expenses that we paid in the 2324 year for

253
00:13:49.032 --> 00:13:51.512
conferences and such that were coming up in the summer that

254
00:13:51.512 --> 00:13:55.244
we prepaid for. Um, and so that's another $110,000. The

255
00:13:55.244 --> 00:13:58.508
bottom line that the undesignated 10.167 is in fact,

256
00:13:58.508 --> 00:13:59.642
correct.

257
00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:03.912
On the restricted side of the budget, we have again. Lots

258
00:14:03.912 --> 00:14:06.912
of pots of money with specific strings attached to them. We

259
00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.612
call those our restricted dollars, that also called

260
00:14:09.612 --> 00:14:11.502
sometimes. Categorical dollars.

261
00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:15.532
Here, we identify exactly what makes up each of those line

262
00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:17.922
items and how many dollars are left in each of those

263
00:14:17.922 --> 00:14:21.042
programs. Um, I included special education, we occasionally

264
00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:23.442
have a little bit of money left on there. This year, we

265
00:14:23.442 --> 00:14:26.202
brought that to zero. We do try. You know, we as you know,

266
00:14:26.202 --> 00:14:28.222
we have to make a contribution from the unrestricted

267
00:14:28.222 --> 00:14:31.782
general fund to cover the cost of educating our students

268
00:14:31.782 --> 00:14:35.502
with exceptional needs. And this year, we were able to get

269
00:14:35.502 --> 00:14:38.672
that number, just dialed in to exactly enough to cover that

270
00:14:38.672 --> 00:14:39.252
with no EX

271
00:14:39.252 --> 00:14:42.132
so that's why you see a zero there, the rest of these

272
00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:44.512
dollars, of course, carry over into the New Year and have

273
00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:47.616
to be used for the purposes for which they've been um

274
00:14:47.616 --> 00:14:50.982
assigned when the uh the state or federal governments gave

275
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.542
those dollars to US.

276
00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:56.712
We also are highlighting the ending fund balance for all of

277
00:14:56.712 --> 00:14:59.012
our other funds. Every now and then, you'll hear in the

278
00:14:59.012 --> 00:15:01.632
news about a government agency that discovers that they

279
00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:04.752
found money that they had forgotten about. Um, 1 of the

280
00:15:04.752 --> 00:15:07.447
ways that can happen is that they just stopped reporting

281
00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:10.571
out on the regular about money and different funds that

282
00:15:10.572 --> 00:15:12.462
maybe don't get used very often.

283
00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:14.882
Um and so we like highlighting this slide because it

284
00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:17.992
indicates all of our funds other than fundo 1 the general

285
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.102
fund and what remains in each of those, the only 1 on here.

286
00:15:22.128 --> 00:15:23.762
That's still a little bit unusual, just because we haven't

287
00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:27.062
used it. Um, except, in the last couple years is fund 40,

288
00:15:27.062 --> 00:15:29.722
and you may recall, this is where we're we, uh, brought in

289
00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:32.327
the proceeds from our loan, for our solar project and where

290
00:15:32.328 --> 00:15:35.472
we've been expending money to cover the cost of that solar

291
00:15:35.472 --> 00:15:38.512
project, we expect that money to be gone at the end of this

292
00:15:38.512 --> 00:15:40.762
year, as we wrap that project up.

293
00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:46.466
In our bond again just because our bond program is so big

294
00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:49.706
fund, 21, Encompass, all of our bond dollars. But we

295
00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:52.274
typically break that out to show you the balances in each

296
00:15:52.274 --> 00:15:55.586
of the bond funds. You'll notice that finally measure, c

297
00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:58.166
and e are actually both off of this list. We have fully

298
00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.226
expended those 2 bond funds and so there is no ending fund

299
00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:04.783
balance and those 2 we still of course have measure h and a

300
00:16:04.783 --> 00:16:08.005
a lot of measure J left to spend um, as well as we're now

301
00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:10.646
tracking the state reimbursement dollars in their own sub

302
00:16:10.646 --> 00:16:12.718
fund, and we'll start reporting those out as their own

303
00:16:12.718 --> 00:16:15.895
separate bucket. And Co meaning them with

304
00:16:15.896 --> 00:16:19.336
um named bond funds because they're not technically Bond

305
00:16:19.336 --> 00:16:22.421
dollars any longer but still very much for facilities

306
00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:23.606
projects

307
00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:27.616
and then finally, this is, again, a relatively new slide,

308
00:16:27.616 --> 00:16:30.656
but we've been asked to show kind of how do we compare

309
00:16:30.816 --> 00:16:33.743
versus where did we start the year with our assumptions and

310
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.500
our projections about what, our budget was going to look

311
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.066
like and where we ended. And again, as we typically do

312
00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:44.936
we've, um, uh, received more money than we thought we were

313
00:16:44.936 --> 00:16:47.126
going to at the start of the year and we've spent more

314
00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:49.156
money than we thought we were going to you at the start of

315
00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:53.556
the year. Um in most years up to that point that has netted

316
00:16:53.556 --> 00:16:55.876
netted out to an improvement in our overall budget, this

317
00:16:56.431 --> 00:16:58.780
unique. If you look at that larger chart on the right side

318
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.336
you'll see that we actually underperformed our budget for

319
00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:03.781
budget for the first time in years. And I attribute that

320
00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:06.328
mostly to the fact that we weren't frankly expecting to

321
00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:09.066
settle as large as we did on our salaries. And so our

322
00:17:09.066 --> 00:17:10.726
expenditures grew at a faster rate than our

323
00:17:10.726 --> 00:17:14.026
Revenues and that explains the difference between where we

324
00:17:14.026 --> 00:17:16.306
projected at the start of the year and where we ended the

325
00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:19.751
year. Um, again continuing to deficit spend, that's the

326
00:17:19.751 --> 00:17:22.330
story we've been talking about for a while now. Um, and the

327
00:17:22.331 --> 00:17:24.586
problem that we're trying to solve is we move forward,

328
00:17:25.566 --> 00:17:29.446
So tonight what we're asking the board to do is to approve

329
00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:32.506
the UN audited actuals. And at that point, they get turned

330
00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:35.326
over to our independent auditor, who is already doing the

331
00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:39.301
work to review, um, our books and our practices to ensure.

332
00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:43.126
And to tell the community that we've fairly presented these

333
00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:46.966
numbers, um, they will finish their independent audit and

334
00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:50.197
turn that over to the State Controllers Office in December

335
00:17:50.197 --> 00:17:52.845
and then they will come back and present to this board in

336
00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:57.291
January. Meanwhile, we're of course, still very much into,

337
00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:59.745
you know, budget monitoring and management mode for the

338
00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:04.591
2425 year, as well as preparing for the 2526 budget season.

339
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:07.606
And so, the next report for the 2425 budget will be the

340
00:18:07.606 --> 00:18:10.516
first interim report, which will show you where we're at

341
00:18:10.516 --> 00:18:13.126
through the end of October. And that will happen at the

342
00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:14.536
December 3rd board meeting.

343
00:18:14.871 --> 00:18:19.951
With that, I am happy to answer any questions. I'm not sure.

344
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:22.435
I guess that is the last slide. I thought I had a question

345
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.871
slide. Um, any questions or comments from the board? I'll

346
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.971
be happy to answer them trustee Blackman.

347
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.471
Thank you for the presentation information. I know it isn't

348
00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:32.716
much different from where we thought we left off at the end

349
00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:37.843
of the spring. Um, 1 question I had about, um, in the

350
00:18:37.843 --> 00:18:41.151
document um, around. I think it's page 97 or so, we there's

351
00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:43.951
some information about nutrition services.

352
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:46.366
And so some of our comparative information that shows um

353
00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:49.651
last year versus moving forward into this year.

354
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:53.169
I know that we have slightly fewer students, roughly 30

355
00:18:53.169 --> 00:18:56.001
fewer Ada projected going forward.

356
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.563
But I noticed there are nutrition budget. If you just look

357
00:18:58.564 --> 00:19:02.821
at the food cost item where we're at funding food itself,

358
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:05.921
we have about a half a million dollar drop.

359
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:09.186
Now, it goes from about a $4 million budget to a 3 and a

360
00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:11.916
half million dollar budget. But we're really only losing 30

361
00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:14.856
students. So I was sort of curious what we would attribute.

362
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:18.711
The the loss of half a million dollars to is it just

363
00:19:18.711 --> 00:19:22.881
something that the feds cut or the state cut or

364
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:26.319
um because that's just raw food dollars that we're not

365
00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:29.217
seeing and I'm wondering if they cut the amount per student

366
00:19:29.218 --> 00:19:33.197
that they provide, or if it's something else that we, it's

367
00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:35.259
just a large number for the number of students that we

368
00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:36.351
lost. So

369
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:42.641
So, to answer part of your question, no, there is no change

370
00:19:42.641 --> 00:19:44.561
in the amount of Revenue, we're getting per meal, so we

371
00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:46.925
still get reimbursed at the same rates. We were getting it

372
00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:50.201
last year, so there's been no change to that. Um, as far as

373
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:54.141
what the, uh, specific difference is in why that number has

374
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:56.741
gone down. I am not prepared to answer that tonight, but I

375
00:19:56.741 --> 00:19:59.054
can certainly do some research and put a report together

376
00:19:59.055 --> 00:20:02.741
for the board for a future. I'm assuming part of it is the

377
00:20:02.945 --> 00:20:07.001
chef um position and all of the ovens that we just

378
00:20:07.001 --> 00:20:10.091
purchased and installed at all the schools.

379
00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:13.843
Again, I need to do some research but yeah, you're

380
00:20:13.843 --> 00:20:16.441
absolutely right. We have we did install quite a bit of

381
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:18.241
Hardware. This summer. You saw a couple of those ovens in

382
00:20:18.281 --> 00:20:21.241
the presentation. Um so let me do a little research and

383
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:24.101
identify what is contributing to that discrepancy between

384
00:20:24.101 --> 00:20:26.809
those and if it's really a difference between food, or if

385
00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:30.181
it's a difference between some of those other, um,

386
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:34.071
Capital cost they're about like 3 or 4 line items and the 1

387
00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:36.761
that dropped precipitously was just the food.

388
00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:39.711
So that's why I was curious. If we only had a 30 student

389
00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:42.298
drop. If we were just receiving few fewer funds for some

390
00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:44.211
reason, maybe there's just something that kicked in and it

391
00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:45.951
just seemed like a large amount of money. I know, you're

392
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:48.171
very interested superintendent, Funk, and ensuring that we

393
00:20:48.171 --> 00:20:51.531
actually provide, you know, appropriate amount of food for

394
00:20:51.531 --> 00:20:53.571
students and that sort of thing. And it just caught me is

395
00:20:53.571 --> 00:20:55.851
like it might actually crimp the ability for us to do that,

396
00:20:55.851 --> 00:20:57.831
so I thought I'd bring it up. Thank you very much.

397
00:20:59.854 --> 00:21:01.664
Trustee Speck.

398
00:21:01.664 --> 00:21:05.002
Uh thank you for the presentation. Um, I have a couple

399
00:21:05.003 --> 00:21:08.222
questions. Um first I appreciate I I tend to ask you

400
00:21:08.312 --> 00:21:12.335
questions offline. Um every time you come up so I

401
00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:15.722
appreciate you um answering those questions for me um um

402
00:21:15.722 --> 00:21:20.474
via email. Um, so when we approved in June, obviously we

403
00:21:20.474 --> 00:21:24.574
you know did not have enough money to cover our budget. And

404
00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:27.467
so part of the budget, we approved in June had a 5.5

405
00:21:27.468 --> 00:21:31.814
million cut, um, for next year school year and the

406
00:21:31.831 --> 00:21:35.103
following year, um, as I look at these numbers, they're

407
00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:39.134
fairly similar to what you expected in June. Um, when you

408
00:21:39.134 --> 00:21:43.754
showed us the 3 year plan with that total of 11 million

409
00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:46.265
dollars, that we would need to cut from the budget, we were

410
00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:49.394
ending the third year at just under a million dollars. Um,

411
00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:54.062
are we still roughly in that spot? Are we? Um, what I can

412
00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:57.134
tell from this is we're improved slightly but not much um

413
00:21:57.134 --> 00:22:01.659
to maybe like 2 million dollars versus slightly under 1, is

414
00:22:01.659 --> 00:22:02.084
that

415
00:22:02.084 --> 00:22:06.234
Accurate. Um as we come upon these big decisions, we're

416
00:22:06.234 --> 00:22:09.264
going to have to make this year. Absolutely. So all else

417
00:22:09.264 --> 00:22:11.949
equal if if all the other projections hold true for the

418
00:22:11.949 --> 00:22:14.004
next 3 years that we talked about when we adopted the

419
00:22:14.004 --> 00:22:16.164
budget or when you adopted the budget in June

420
00:22:16.164 --> 00:22:20.040
Then yeah, the the short version is that we had about 920

421
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.384
thousand dollars. Um, Fallout at the at the UN audited

422
00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:26.544
actuals in the unrestricted general fund.

423
00:22:26.544 --> 00:22:30.864
So you can basically take that chart from that night.

424
00:22:30.864 --> 00:22:35.415
And just add that 921000 to the bottom line number on all

425
00:22:35.416 --> 00:22:38.244
of those. So yeah, I think it improves it to about 1.7 1.8

426
00:22:38.244 --> 00:22:42.396
million in that uh third year out instead of the 800 plus

427
00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:45.072
plus thousand that we had shown. Okay. So slight

428
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:49.301
Improvement but um, clearly not 11 million dollars. So,

429
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:53.663
unfortunately, um, barring some dramatic increase from the

430
00:22:54.364 --> 00:22:57.774
years. We would still have to make some very serious Cuts

431
00:22:57.774 --> 00:23:02.874
in order to have a balanced budget, inn 3, 3 years. Um,

432
00:23:03.154 --> 00:23:08.242
Can you help me with, um, on the slide? I appreciate those

433
00:23:08.243 --> 00:23:10.904
ending balances, and especially the rationale we never want

434
00:23:10.904 --> 00:23:14.774
to just find that money sitting somewhere. Um, the fun, 35

435
00:23:14.774 --> 00:23:17.789
County school facilities fund. Can you help me with what

436
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:21.494
that is? That is actually reimbursement from opsc that

437
00:23:21.494 --> 00:23:24.344
we've not yet transferred into fund 211.

438
00:23:24.344 --> 00:23:27.369
So those are actually dollars that we've gotten from the

439
00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:30.519
state. I'm not sure frankly why it's titled County school

440
00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:34.104
facilities fund but when the state reimburses us for

441
00:23:34.104 --> 00:23:37.789
projects that we've done in the past those days, get

442
00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.244
deposited first in the fund, 35, and then we come and ask

443
00:23:41.244 --> 00:23:43.944
the board to let us move those into fund 211. And we just

444
00:23:43.944 --> 00:23:45.584
haven't done that with them, okay? These but this is a

445
00:23:45.584 --> 00:23:46.134
state usually, right?

446
00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:49.155
Not counting money state money. Okay. So it's what we've

447
00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:51.736
talked about in numerous times and it's it goes into our

448
00:23:51.736 --> 00:23:54.916
building fund. Exactly? Okay, thank you. Um,

449
00:23:55.506 --> 00:23:59.806
I know that you're just presenting on the UN audited.

450
00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.936
Actuals, is there any other

451
00:24:01.956 --> 00:24:05.536
News you've had from the state um that would help us get

452
00:24:05.536 --> 00:24:09.796
excited about our next 2 years or are we still looking at

453
00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:14.536
the same as what you had presented in June? I have no new

454
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:16.996
news to report on the state budget. There is been no

455
00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:19.936
significant change in our projections or expectations about

456
00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:21.436
what that looks like. Okay. I

457
00:24:21.436 --> 00:24:24.472
Was your answer but I um felt the need to ask the question.

458
00:24:24.472 --> 00:24:26.026
So thank you very much this 1.

459
00:24:26.496 --> 00:24:30.256
Unfortunately, that was the same expression. He gave entire

460
00:24:30.256 --> 00:24:32.536
cabinet uh last week.

461
00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:38.686
All righty. Thank you. Um, I think we do, we need to vote

462
00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:42.938
to accept these. Except this, I'll take a motion. I'll move

463
00:24:42.938 --> 00:24:47.575
that. We accept the UN audited actuals, I'll second

464
00:24:47.876 --> 00:24:53.556
All righty, trustee peswani. I everyone else I I I carries

465
00:24:53.556 --> 00:24:56.016
unanimously. Thank you. All right thank you.

466
00:24:56.676 --> 00:25:01.328
Next up is our open public? Comment period. Um if there's

467
00:25:01.328 --> 00:25:05.355
anyone do we have any in-person? I don't see any

468
00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:09.126
Paint papers. I don't see any person. If there is anyone

469
00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:11.536
online who would like to make a public comment during the

470
00:25:11.536 --> 00:25:14.736
open public comment. I'll give you about a minute or so.

471
00:25:14.736 --> 00:25:17.016
To get logged on and raise your hand.

472
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:21.456
Um otherwise any any public comments would need to be on

473
00:25:21.456 --> 00:25:23.256
the agenda is item.

474
00:25:23.256 --> 00:25:25.236
During that that time.

475
00:25:25.586 --> 00:25:27.636
so, just

476
00:25:28.966 --> 00:25:31.166
Double-checking.

477
00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:33.436
No 1. Okay.

478
00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:38.936
Well, then we will move on to the first reading.

479
00:25:39.516 --> 00:25:41.236
um,

480
00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:44.196
of a board policy.

481
00:25:44.196 --> 00:25:45.526
Dr. Campbell

482
00:25:46.746 --> 00:25:50.026
thank you, president pelum superintendent. Funk Board of

483
00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:54.136
Trustees and members of our community. Uh, Dave. While the

484
00:25:54.136 --> 00:25:57.874
our CTO was here last couple of weeks and presenting to you

485
00:25:57.874 --> 00:26:02.086
board policy on the AI and he is here before you with a

486
00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:05.805
different board policy, but it fits within the same vein

487
00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:10.143
and or theme in terms of Dublin, Unified School District

488
00:26:10.143 --> 00:26:13.826
being on the front edge or the Leading Edge of um of

489
00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:17.659
creating policy relating to this. You probably heard a lot

490
00:26:17.672 --> 00:26:20.761
of news and Governor noem talking about cell phones in the

491
00:26:20.762 --> 00:26:25.230
classroom. So I just wanted to recognize Dave, his team for

492
00:26:25.231 --> 00:26:29.626
coming here to you for a first reading. And so Dave Waldy,

493
00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:42.112
I still don't I still don't know how Hobbs has it this low?

494
00:26:42.112 --> 00:26:46.837
Okay. Uh, good evening, uh president palum superintendent,

495
00:26:46.837 --> 00:26:50.437
Funk Board of Trustees and executive cabinet. Uh, tonight I

496
00:26:50.437 --> 00:26:54.165
bring to you the first reading of board policy and

497
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:57.997
administrative regulation 5131.8.

498
00:26:57.997 --> 00:27:01.117
Entitled mobile communication devices.

499
00:27:01.117 --> 00:27:05.011
Uh, just a little background for you in 2019, the state

500
00:27:05.012 --> 00:27:10.677
legislature passed AB 272, Which authorized a change in Ed

501
00:27:10.677 --> 00:27:16.969
code, uh, 48901.5 and 48901.7 which allowed school

502
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.057
districts to adopt and pass part, uh, policies regarding

503
00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:25.505
the use of cell phones in, um, in classrooms and on school

504
00:27:25.506 --> 00:27:29.683
sites. But it was optional. So, um, it wasn't a requirement

505
00:27:29.683 --> 00:27:34.016
for, um, school boards to do this, but 2 weeks ago,

506
00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:40.157
Uh, the state legislature passed AB 3216, which requires

507
00:27:40.157 --> 00:27:43.883
governing boards to adopt a policy for the use of student

508
00:27:43.884 --> 00:27:48.977
of cell phone use, um, by 2026 and update that policy,

509
00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:50.177
every 5 years.

510
00:27:50.177 --> 00:27:55.617
So, interesting enough. Um, starting last septembar, our

511
00:27:55.617 --> 00:27:58.737
technology advisory committee smartphones subcommittee

512
00:27:58.737 --> 00:28:02.577
began working. Uh looking at developing a resolution or

513
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:09.117
policy under the ABA 272 guidelines and with their work and

514
00:28:09.117 --> 00:28:12.657
the assistance of superintendent Funk, and our, um, School

515
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:15.604
site principals. We have a board policy and administrative

516
00:28:15.605 --> 00:28:18.747
regulation before you today, that is in line with the new,

517
00:28:18.747 --> 00:28:21.057
uh, legislation that was passed 2 weeks ago.

518
00:28:21.057 --> 00:28:25.267
uh, this policy before you outlined student use of

519
00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:30.161
smartphones phones and other devices uh on school sites

520
00:28:30.162 --> 00:28:33.157
like uh SmartWatches and um

521
00:28:33.157 --> 00:28:35.257
Uh, like Bluetooth headphones.

522
00:28:35.257 --> 00:28:39.307
For TK, through 8, students will not be able to use their

523
00:28:39.307 --> 00:28:42.847
cell phones during the school day. Uh, those cell phones

524
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:46.657
and other devices must be put, uh, turned off and put away.

525
00:28:46.657 --> 00:28:50.334
in the high school, students can use their, uh, phones

526
00:28:50.335 --> 00:28:54.457
before school during lunch and after school, but they need

527
00:28:54.457 --> 00:28:58.577
to be turned off during all other educational times.

528
00:28:58.577 --> 00:29:01.047
students with medical conditions that require the use of a

529
00:29:01.047 --> 00:29:05.047
phone such as a diabetic Monitor, and or have a

530
00:29:05.047 --> 00:29:09.777
individualized education plan or 504 that involves the use

531
00:29:09.777 --> 00:29:13.582
of a device will be able to use their devices uh, in the

532
00:29:13.583 --> 00:29:16.287
classroom and during instructional time.

533
00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:20.336
And I just wanted to note that, uh, all students can still

534
00:29:20.337 --> 00:29:24.357
use their phones and cases of emergency and, uh, or and or

535
00:29:24.357 --> 00:29:25.617
perceive threat.

536
00:29:25.617 --> 00:29:30.287
Uh students are still um not allowed to use their phones in

537
00:29:30.287 --> 00:29:33.362
bathrooms uh locker rooms or in areas of perceived privacy

538
00:29:33.362 --> 00:29:37.337
and students. Still must comply with the acceptable use

539
00:29:37.337 --> 00:29:42.977
policy, um, while on School site. So that includes. Um,

540
00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:47.837
also includes like after after uh, after school like

541
00:29:47.837 --> 00:29:49.997
sporting events and things like that. So just because the

542
00:29:49.997 --> 00:29:51.947
Bell Rings doesn't mean this policy stops.

543
00:29:51.947 --> 00:29:54.577
And I welcome any of your questions today.

544
00:29:55.887 --> 00:29:57.757
Trustee spec.

545
00:29:57.757 --> 00:30:02.797
Um, I have a question on SmartWatches um, specifically for

546
00:30:02.797 --> 00:30:03.697
K8

547
00:30:03.697 --> 00:30:07.097
Although, I guess for all of them to some degree. But, um,

548
00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:12.571
How, you know a phone you can. Um put up front. Like how do

549
00:30:12.571 --> 00:30:14.887
we know they're off? Um,

550
00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:18.807
And are you expecting with this that they aren't allowed to

551
00:30:18.807 --> 00:30:24.127
wear them? Like, what is off for a smartwatch? You can turn

552
00:30:24.127 --> 00:30:27.727
us. Like, I have a smart 1. Sure, it's on my desk. Mine's

553
00:30:27.727 --> 00:30:29.707
on. Do not disturb because it's a board meeting and I'm not

554
00:30:29.707 --> 00:30:31.207
supposed to have texts. Yeah. But like is that

555
00:30:31.207 --> 00:30:34.582
That. Is that, okay, that they have, no, it should be

556
00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:37.427
turned off. And the reason for that is, we do have students

557
00:30:37.427 --> 00:30:38.107
that

558
00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:42.057
they will set their phone like away in their backpack or

559
00:30:42.057 --> 00:30:44.577
set their phone, in 1 of the sleeves, that's provided and

560
00:30:44.577 --> 00:30:47.697
that they will use their phone. In order to, they will use

561
00:30:47.697 --> 00:30:50.307
their smartwatch to control their phone to make phone calls

562
00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:55.593
to, to the playlists on their headphones. So, um, we are

563
00:30:55.593 --> 00:30:57.417
requiring them to be turned off.

564
00:30:57.477 --> 00:31:00.817
How that's going to happen, would be in working with the

565
00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:04.657
principals and also working with the teacher uh, the DTA to

566
00:31:04.657 --> 00:31:07.501
to how we are going to implement that part. But I it's

567
00:31:07.501 --> 00:31:10.097
important that those are turned off because we know that

568
00:31:10.097 --> 00:31:14.947
students can kind of lean over and and, and, and still play

569
00:31:14.947 --> 00:31:17.617
their music and be distracted. Still take phone calls,

570
00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:20.257
still take texts on their texts on their phone. Depending

571
00:31:20.257 --> 00:31:22.987
on what kind of phone, uh, smart. I'm sorry.

572
00:31:22.987 --> 00:31:25.787
From their phone on their Smartwatch, depending on what the

573
00:31:25.787 --> 00:31:26.897
Smartwatch they have.

574
00:31:26.897 --> 00:31:29.847
So it is it is still important that they can definitely

575
00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:32.717
text while on a smartwatch.

576
00:31:32.717 --> 00:31:36.007
I have received texts from a student on their Smartwatch,

577
00:31:36.007 --> 00:31:37.567
so, um,

578
00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:43.211
So, physically off, I I I think I'm not really sure exactly

579
00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:45.627
how I feel about it but I I know a lot of parents are

580
00:31:45.727 --> 00:31:47.435
putting these on their kids especially younger for

581
00:31:47.435 --> 00:31:50.207
elementary to track their kids and so when it's off, they

582
00:31:50.207 --> 00:31:54.011
cannot track their child. So I do think we're going to have

583
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:57.077
some push back on that. Um

584
00:31:57.465 --> 00:32:03.865
Uh, in do not disturb, they cannot receive a text but um,

585
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.352
they can send a text and, um, but they can still be

586
00:32:07.353 --> 00:32:11.605
tracked, correct. Um, but they could definitely like I

587
00:32:11.605 --> 00:32:13.665
could right now, send a text, but they aren't coming in

588
00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:17.785
because it's in do not disturb. So we would allow it to

589
00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:19.765
still be on the wrist, but we would expect it to be fully

590
00:32:19.765 --> 00:32:23.315
powered off. Yes, if it's on the wrist. Yeah, for for right

591
00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:28.530
now, but also all smart watch manufacturers, make different

592
00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:33.085
kinds of functions and features and so we could possibly

593
00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:35.695
also investigate that as well. But like I said it's it's

594
00:32:35.695 --> 00:32:38.329
going to be I think the 3 groups getting together how that

595
00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:41.095
particular 1 because that is very specific. Yeah.

596
00:32:41.095 --> 00:32:43.155
I just know there's more and more.

597
00:32:43.155 --> 00:32:47.165
Kids at the elementary school, having them on. Um,

598
00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.415
Necessarily to a positive. I mean, I've heard stories of

599
00:32:49.415 --> 00:32:50.705
parents showing up.

600
00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:54.755
Um, and you know, the kid didn't actually go to the office

601
00:32:54.755 --> 00:32:57.755
and say I feel bad. They just told Mom and Dad on the watch

602
00:32:57.755 --> 00:32:59.880
and the mom and dad came to the office and said I'm ready

603
00:32:59.881 --> 00:33:02.555
to pick the kid up and kids still in the classroom. So I

604
00:33:02.555 --> 00:33:04.595
mean I know that there's some definitely some negatives

605
00:33:04.595 --> 00:33:07.055
happening because the kids have them on. But um, you know

606
00:33:07.055 --> 00:33:09.395
for the most part parents are tracking their kid and that's

607
00:33:09.395 --> 00:33:11.765
why they have it on. So um

608
00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:18.569
Okay um from a phone standpoint uh is the expectation. It's

609
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:20.538
off as well, it's not just do not disturb, it's like

610
00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:24.605
completely powered off, correct? Um for the K8, uh, 4K 8

611
00:33:24.605 --> 00:33:28.187
and 4 high school and during instructional times, not

612
00:33:28.188 --> 00:33:30.613
during lunch before, and after school. But during

613
00:33:30.614 --> 00:33:32.585
instructional times for the high school, that it is powered

614
00:33:32.585 --> 00:33:35.199
off, okay? And that's pretty much the expectation. Right

615
00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:38.134
now, particularly with many teachers, as they go like,

616
00:33:38.135 --> 00:33:40.179
sometimes they put them in sleeves and things, things like

617
00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:43.444
that in the where they, they should be powered down because

618
00:33:43.445 --> 00:33:45.869
obviously texts come through all these things. They can

619
00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:47.795
disrupt the classroom. Sure. Yeah.

620
00:33:48.245 --> 00:33:52.965
But they can use them during emergency purposes, so they

621
00:33:52.965 --> 00:33:56.025
can turn on their phones. If there is a a threat to the

622
00:33:56.025 --> 00:33:58.695
school or they perceive a threat to themselves.

623
00:34:02.155 --> 00:34:03.755
Trustee Blackman.

624
00:34:05.205 --> 00:34:09.445
Thank you for the presentation. Um, I have a couple

625
00:34:09.445 --> 00:34:10.885
comments and questions, um,

626
00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:16.717
so um, I guess 1 of the things that I wanted to ask about

627
00:34:16.717 --> 00:34:19.285
is under the board policy. For example, there is a

628
00:34:19.285 --> 00:34:21.385
statement in there and this is why I want to clarify

629
00:34:21.385 --> 00:34:24.160
because obviously something changed last 2 weeks. When we

630
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.965
talk about confiscating, a device from a student.

631
00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:32.355
um, I understand why but are we actually

632
00:34:32.477 --> 00:34:35.817
When it's out of their control, this is not like a book.

633
00:34:35.817 --> 00:34:38.767
Or a bag. This is an electronic device that needs to be

634
00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:42.257
powered up. So are we confiscating it and placing it in

635
00:34:42.257 --> 00:34:44.814
place, where it can remain charged so that the student

636
00:34:44.814 --> 00:34:46.936
doesn't lose all. I'm not saying we're going to hold it all

637
00:34:46.937 --> 00:34:49.712
day but who knows? Would we actually retain it in a matter

638
00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.416
that would be able to still hold its charge so they don't

639
00:34:52.417 --> 00:34:55.457
lose content and information on it because we just left it

640
00:34:55.457 --> 00:34:57.977
unplugged somewhere in a cabinet until the parents show up.

641
00:34:57.987 --> 00:35:02.722
Uh, I would believe the expectation is that. Um, the phone

642
00:35:02.722 --> 00:35:05.617
is powered down when it is given to the teacher.

643
00:35:05.617 --> 00:35:08.317
And then the teacher has the ability to take it to the

644
00:35:08.317 --> 00:35:10.684
office or call a campus. Supervisor to bring it to the

645
00:35:10.684 --> 00:35:12.596
office for it to be safely secured.

646
00:35:12.597 --> 00:35:15.267
Okay, so you would say that somewhere in the document that

647
00:35:15.267 --> 00:35:17.147
when it's handed over, it's going to be powered down. Yeah,

648
00:35:17.147 --> 00:35:20.127
we could add that. Okay. Um, the next question I had was

649
00:35:20.127 --> 00:35:24.447
about, um, when the search and seizure piece. Um, I

650
00:35:24.447 --> 00:35:27.987
understand that there is this notion that when there is

651
00:35:27.987 --> 00:35:29.247
perhaps,

652
00:35:29.247 --> 00:35:33.837
um, some reason on the part of staff to believe that they

653
00:35:33.837 --> 00:35:38.937
need to see and view what's on the cell phone or maybe it's

654
00:35:38.937 --> 00:35:42.687
the watch. Um, I want to ask about

655
00:35:42.687 --> 00:35:46.439
FCC rules and regulations around that. I know then some

656
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.532
instances like law enforcement is not allowed to ask you

657
00:35:49.532 --> 00:35:52.537
for your phone and to have access to it unless they have a

658
00:35:52.537 --> 00:35:53.237
warrant.

659
00:35:53.237 --> 00:35:56.767
So I want to understand when students are handing over

660
00:35:56.767 --> 00:35:57.817
their phone,

661
00:35:57.817 --> 00:36:00.829
Granted many of them are minors. They wouldn't know what

662
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:04.417
the law provides and doesn't provide. Do we know for

663
00:36:04.417 --> 00:36:07.317
certain that we are lawfully allowed to ask them to hand

664
00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:10.857
over full access to their phone, or do we, in fact have to

665
00:36:10.857 --> 00:36:12.877
have a warrant to ask for that.

666
00:36:12.877 --> 00:36:16.947
My understanding and and um, superintendent Punk might be

667
00:36:16.947 --> 00:36:20.367
able to clarify more that they do have to have a a warrant

668
00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:22.627
or they have to have the they're underage of parents

669
00:36:22.627 --> 00:36:25.149
permission in order to be the phone. We could ask for

670
00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:28.926
permission. Yeah, yeah. There there's nothing that's

671
00:36:28.927 --> 00:36:31.955
prevents us from asking the student. May we assess your

672
00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:35.067
phone. You don't need a warrant for that. The police do,

673
00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:39.237
right? But the School site does not so but if a student

674
00:36:39.237 --> 00:36:41.847
refuses, they don't give you permission, then you don't

675
00:36:41.847 --> 00:36:44.037
have the right to access the phone, unless you have a

676
00:36:44.037 --> 00:36:45.307
warrant because I understand what the police that's

677
00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:47.343
correct. They have they have to ask and you have to give

678
00:36:47.343 --> 00:36:49.407
permission but you can say no. And the only way they get to

679
00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:52.107
it is with a warrant so this would be the same. So would we

680
00:36:52.107 --> 00:36:54.807
clarify that in the policy then so that when we talk about

681
00:36:54.807 --> 00:36:57.467
educating students about their rights that that's in this

682
00:36:57.467 --> 00:36:59.511
piece that they understand what their rights are with

683
00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:00.687
regard to privacy,

684
00:37:02.047 --> 00:37:06.107
um, on the are, um,

685
00:37:06.107 --> 00:37:09.029
I know the are isn't really anything the board reviews but I

686
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.120
just want to ask a couple things about um,

687
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.440
Know, when students are in PE.

688
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.226
The PE teacher especially when they're running laps, ask

689
00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:21.043
them to time. Their laps, most of the students do that by

690
00:37:21.043 --> 00:37:24.099
actually using their watch, or their cell phone. So if

691
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.650
we're asking students, not that they're supposed to do

692
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.960
this, they just do it. Have default, because they don't

693
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.909
have enough, stop watches for all the kids. Are we going to

694
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:34.210
be providing stopwatches for all of that? Now that students

695
00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.814
are going to have to place their phones? I don't know where

696
00:37:36.814 --> 00:37:39.130
on the field, that's another question where they're

697
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.410
supposed to place their phones because they always are told

698
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.880
not to put in their locker.

699
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.105
But are we going to make some accommodation for how PE is

700
00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:49.430
sort of reliant on students using phones to track timing of

701
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.110
laps?

702
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.450
Well, I guess the question is where are they storing them?

703
00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.546
Now, if they're if they're doing PE and they're risking the

704
00:37:55.546 --> 00:37:59.658
danger of them being broken or cracked or anything to that

705
00:37:59.658 --> 00:38:04.749
effect, um, we do put in into the are that the teachers

706
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:10.135
cannot require, um, uh, activity that. So, you know, solely

707
00:38:10.135 --> 00:38:13.390
requires a cell phone to be done that. We cannot require,

708
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.250
um, or we cannot provide additional, right? So, this is

709
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.620
what you're asking about. The, the, the stopwatch, um,

710
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.150
But we do have the ability in um, number 2 where a teacher

711
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.970
or administrator can grant the ability.

712
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.760
For a student to use it. So that might be a case where that

713
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.420
would be, but then they'd have to be turned off afterwards.

714
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.900
Okay, so to follow up with that, a couple things have been

715
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.920
conveyed to me is that, uh, yearbook, for example is a

716
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.820
course, which requires the students to be able to go

717
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.570
through the school and photograph other students. So I know

718
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.620
we're saying we're supposed to turn off our phones and

719
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.504
they're not supposed to be using them. But these students

720
00:38:49.504 --> 00:38:52.060
in particular have been staying that they have issues right

721
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.200
now because either if 1 if they don't have a camera or a

722
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.630
phone to take photographs that's 1 issue but if they do

723
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.740
this policy would prevent them from actually doing what

724
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.540
they're supposed to be doing as part of their classwork.

725
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.744
So are we going to do something as a workaround? Do they

726
00:39:07.744 --> 00:39:09.580
wear a patch that says like yearbooks. We know if they have

727
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.060
their camera on that that's okay. Is there something that

728
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.540
would have to be disclosed? Why they're using their phone?

729
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.400
Or are we just going to say blanket? No phone. And we're

730
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.620
going to provide them all with school cameras to use.

731
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:28.820
So the policy is clear that a teacher can allow the

732
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.900
students to use the phone. Uh, you just can't require it

733
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.756
for a student that does not have a phone without providing

734
00:39:35.828 --> 00:39:41.274
an alternative, uh, device. And so, if they don't have

735
00:39:41.274 --> 00:39:44.719
photo cameras for your book, and the teacher says, you can

736
00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:49.592
use your uh, cell phone to take those pictures. Then

737
00:39:49.592 --> 00:39:50.570
ideally that teacher is going to

738
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:55.073
Give a pass so that the student, uh, anyone on campus that

739
00:39:55.073 --> 00:39:57.490
stops them will know. They're part of the yearbook group.

740
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.932
You don't need to put that in the policy. That's an

741
00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:02.888
individual, uh, teacher that would have to work that out.

742
00:40:02.888 --> 00:40:04.753
That's great. I'm glad you're explaining that because I

743
00:40:04.753 --> 00:40:07.133
wasn't certain how staff on site would identify the

744
00:40:07.133 --> 00:40:09.526
students with yearbook taking photographs and they would be

745
00:40:09.527 --> 00:40:11.213
stopped all the time so if there's something there, that's

746
00:40:11.213 --> 00:40:14.873
great. Um, thank you. Um, the last question I want to ask

747
00:40:14.953 --> 00:40:18.653
about something the law of our high school students use and

748
00:40:18.653 --> 00:40:22.433
it has mostly due because when our School DHS was very

749
00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:26.165
impacted by the population of our students and during any

750
00:40:26.165 --> 00:40:29.041
class time, there would be a lot of students handing in

751
00:40:29.042 --> 00:40:31.223
homework handing in projects

752
00:40:31.223 --> 00:40:33.903
That would allow times. Get lost because there's just a

753
00:40:33.903 --> 00:40:36.903
pile where it all gets stacked up as you leave the door. A

754
00:40:36.903 --> 00:40:39.123
lot of students were notified by teachers over many years.

755
00:40:39.123 --> 00:40:42.273
That their work was lost not handed in and they'd be docked

756
00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:45.893
for it. Students became when the Advent of the cell phone

757
00:40:45.893 --> 00:40:49.023
came about students began to photograph their work being

758
00:40:49.023 --> 00:40:52.467
handed in. So they actually had a record and therefore if

759
00:40:52.467 --> 00:40:54.783
ever it was lost, they had something to come back to

760
00:40:54.783 --> 00:40:56.673
teachers show. In fact it had been handed in it.

761
00:40:56.673 --> 00:40:59.428
So if we're not doing that, are we going to provide some

762
00:40:59.428 --> 00:41:02.363
other means to validate when work gets handed in than, in

763
00:41:02.363 --> 00:41:05.117
fact, it is actually handed in because this happens every

764
00:41:05.118 --> 00:41:08.473
year, it's almost every student and at least 1 or more of

765
00:41:08.623 --> 00:41:11.923
their classes. And given our grading policy, I don't want

766
00:41:11.923 --> 00:41:14.323
to see students affected by the fact that we shouldn't be

767
00:41:14.323 --> 00:41:16.273
doing paper handins. But we do

768
00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:19.023
So, if there's some way that we can augment that to

769
00:41:19.023 --> 00:41:20.943
guarantee that students still have the ability to show that

770
00:41:20.943 --> 00:41:23.503
they've documented that their work was handed in. I don't

771
00:41:23.503 --> 00:41:25.823
know how I'm leaving a map to you but that's some of these

772
00:41:25.843 --> 00:41:28.183
students have come to rely on because they have no other

773
00:41:28.183 --> 00:41:30.680
way to justify a piece of work went in. If they don't

774
00:41:30.681 --> 00:41:33.583
actually have a copy of that work being handed in, so,

775
00:41:33.583 --> 00:41:36.743
That's my only other comment to the are. Thank you.

776
00:41:38.113 --> 00:41:39.953
Joseph Sewanee

777
00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:44.368
I have a couple comments regarding it being necessary for

778
00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:47.713
the students to have their smartphones powered off. So I

779
00:41:47.713 --> 00:41:50.653
understand that um, when we're talking about smart watches,

780
00:41:50.653 --> 00:41:54.253
how like if the smartphone is just left on or on do not

781
00:41:54.253 --> 00:41:57.133
disturb how they can easily like connect to the cell phone,

782
00:41:57.133 --> 00:42:00.433
and still do the same things. But I know majority of

783
00:42:00.433 --> 00:42:02.893
students, from what I've seen, don't actually own smart

784
00:42:02.893 --> 00:42:05.645
watches. I know the younger groups especially in elementary

785
00:42:05.645 --> 00:42:08.182
elementary school or trustees spec said, uh, for tracking

786
00:42:08.182 --> 00:42:10.973
their parents, let them wear these but in middle school and

787
00:42:10.973 --> 00:42:13.813
and high school, I think less students were smart watches,

788
00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:17.923
they mainly just have a cell phone. And my concern about

789
00:42:17.923 --> 00:42:20.653
about this is, as you said, phones are, of course,

790
00:42:20.683 --> 00:42:23.728
permitted in an emergency, but if their phone is powered

791
00:42:23.728 --> 00:42:27.713
off, and the emergency is like extremely urgent turning on

792
00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:31.093
a lot of these phones and getting them connected to, um,

793
00:42:31.093 --> 00:42:33.844
like just service or anything takes a takes a good amount

794
00:42:33.845 --> 00:42:36.865
of time and it really depends on the phone and I've just

795
00:42:36.865 --> 00:42:40.213
noticed this. And with that, my question comes like, why is

796
00:42:40.213 --> 00:42:40.933
it necessary?

797
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:44.045
Carry that phones. Have to be powered off and can't be kept

798
00:42:44.046 --> 00:42:45.618
on. Do not disturb.

799
00:42:45.668 --> 00:42:50.208
Um, more to the you talking about phones, not smart watches

800
00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:53.562
right now, sorry? Yeah. Smart phones. Okay. So when we talk

801
00:42:53.563 --> 00:42:55.848
about smartphones 1 of the reasons they should be powered

802
00:42:55.848 --> 00:43:01.408
off is 1, is that students will? Like I said before they

803
00:43:01.408 --> 00:43:04.836
will put their head, their, their wireless headphones on

804
00:43:04.836 --> 00:43:09.408
set a playlist said anything. Um, and B and sit there and

805
00:43:09.438 --> 00:43:12.888
listen and not being engaged uh in the in the classroom

806
00:43:12.888 --> 00:43:16.608
instruction. The second is um,

807
00:43:16.668 --> 00:43:21.508
we would be taking time out of the classroom for each,

808
00:43:21.508 --> 00:43:24.928
teach for a teacher, to make sure that every single

809
00:43:24.928 --> 00:43:29.058
Students cell phone is put on, Do Not Disturb and that is

810
00:43:29.058 --> 00:43:31.698
taking away from instructional time within the classroom.

811
00:43:31.698 --> 00:43:35.082
So that would be a good at least 5 minutes. Considering if

812
00:43:35.082 --> 00:43:39.198
you have a class of 36, um, a 5 minutes for the teacher to

813
00:43:39.198 --> 00:43:41.778
go and verify that if we have them off, then we know that

814
00:43:41.778 --> 00:43:46.386
they're not. Um, then they're not going to be ringing or uh

815
00:43:46.386 --> 00:43:49.488
uh, or you know, you hear text. You know, all those kinds

816
00:43:49.488 --> 00:43:53.448
of things going on while. Um, school is instructional time.

817
00:43:54.218 --> 00:43:58.798
And, um, if will the teacher like confirm, if the phones are

818
00:43:58.798 --> 00:44:02.160
powered off, or will there be no confirmation for that, if

819
00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:06.678
that's, um, 1, if the hopefully that the student can show

820
00:44:06.678 --> 00:44:10.158
the teacher, there's all they have to do is show it up and

821
00:44:10.158 --> 00:44:13.698
and um, there's a couple other ways, the other ideas to

822
00:44:13.698 --> 00:44:16.500
have it packed away. You know, if it's off during the

823
00:44:16.501 --> 00:44:20.988
school day, we want to create a environment and a

824
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.620
You know, um, how to say it, I want to say a process or

825
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:27.193
anything, that's students know that these need to be put

826
00:44:27.194 --> 00:44:30.273
away and they they shouldn't be out, uh, during

827
00:44:30.299 --> 00:44:32.387
instructional time. So, let me clarify, I think what I

828
00:44:32.388 --> 00:44:36.948
heard you say, uh, the expectation is that teachers, every

829
00:44:36.948 --> 00:44:40.088
period are not checking cell phones, and that students are

830
00:44:40.088 --> 00:44:44.352
not walking in showing their phone is off. If a student,

831
00:44:44.352 --> 00:44:47.808
has their phone out and the teacher sees that and the

832
00:44:47.808 --> 00:44:51.798
teacher asks to see that phone, if it's not powered off,

833
00:44:51.798 --> 00:44:54.888
then that's going to be a violation, right? If it's off,

834
00:44:54.888 --> 00:44:57.456
they're going to tell them. Just put put the phone back,

835
00:44:57.456 --> 00:44:58.128
but

836
00:44:58.128 --> 00:45:01.668
I'm not, we're not going to be the police on this and I'm

837
00:45:01.668 --> 00:45:04.938
not support. The governor has never been a teacher, he has

838
00:45:04.938 --> 00:45:08.118
no idea what it's like to be in the classroom and I'm not

839
00:45:08.118 --> 00:45:12.368
going to require our teachers to be the police mob on cell

840
00:45:12.368 --> 00:45:15.168
phones, if a student violates the policy,

841
00:45:15.168 --> 00:45:18.468
Then we expect them to hand the phone over and be respectful

842
00:45:18.468 --> 00:45:21.764
for it. They'll get it back at the end of the day. Um, but

843
00:45:21.764 --> 00:45:23.948
I'm, we're not going to get into this checking every single

844
00:45:23.948 --> 00:45:27.128
phone. Every single period, I mean that's just not doable.

845
00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:29.928
Trustee spec.

846
00:45:29.928 --> 00:45:33.008
Can I ask you some more questions trustee Sewanee since

847
00:45:33.008 --> 00:45:36.808
you're living it? Um I I know like as a parent um at back

848
00:45:36.848 --> 00:45:38.780
to school night, I heard way more about cell phones than

849
00:45:38.781 --> 00:45:41.523
I've ever heard um, in a positive way like they would show

850
00:45:41.628 --> 00:45:44.142
me this block at the front and this is where they're, you

851
00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:47.328
know, I'm putting their phone's, um, both at the middle

852
00:45:47.338 --> 00:45:49.668
school and high school level, I heard much more about it.

853
00:45:49.668 --> 00:45:52.488
Um, so I assume you have experienced that as a student. Um,

854
00:45:52.488 --> 00:45:55.248
have you been given Direction on, when you put your phone

855
00:45:55.248 --> 00:45:58.608
up there, do they want it powered off? Do they want it on?

856
00:45:58.608 --> 00:46:01.428
Do not disturb. Is there any sort of standard? I'm just

857
00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:04.848
curious your experiences. So of course we are required to

858
00:46:04.848 --> 00:46:08.798
put our phones up there, but most teachers say, just keep

859
00:46:08.798 --> 00:46:11.958
it on silent as long as it's silent. There will be no issue

860
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.768
because I mean, actually, there's no different different

861
00:46:15.768 --> 00:46:18.288
between there's no difference between having a powered off

862
00:46:18.288 --> 00:46:20.328
and on silent from like the teacher's perspective because

863
00:46:20.328 --> 00:46:22.308
all that the teachers aim for is that there's no like

864
00:46:22.308 --> 00:46:24.888
ringing or buzzing going on. And yeah, that's just their

865
00:46:24.888 --> 00:46:27.678
main like idea when telling us to put our phones away.

866
00:46:27.678 --> 00:46:31.768
Okay, I would say and I don't think it really, I guess it

867
00:46:31.768 --> 00:46:34.498
does say, turned off in here. I'd rather leave this to

868
00:46:34.498 --> 00:46:38.368
teacher, um, preference, frankly. Um, I like, the the

869
00:46:38.368 --> 00:46:40.734
blocks that they have at the front, it gets it away.

870
00:46:40.735 --> 00:46:42.319
Although some are using, hey, you're putting them right

871
00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.668
there on your desk because we might have a need for it, but

872
00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:47.488
I can see the 5 out and there's a group of 5. And so, I see

873
00:46:47.488 --> 00:46:49.468
5 phones, like, every teacher kind of had some different

874
00:46:49.468 --> 00:46:51.848
ways. They did it, which and they all had good rationale

875
00:46:51.848 --> 00:46:55.828
for it. Um, but I would rather leave this to the teacher as

876
00:46:55.888 --> 00:47:00.293
far as a turned off versus a do not disturb. If they, um,

877
00:47:00.293 --> 00:47:03.196
start with, hey, you know, being silenced, fine, and they

878
00:47:03.268 --> 00:47:05.413
start to have problems with it and then, that teacher says,

879
00:47:05.413 --> 00:47:08.548
forget it now. They're all off, then they're all off. Um,

880
00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:12.088
but if it's all working good and they are okay with do not

881
00:47:12.088 --> 00:47:13.558
disturb, then

882
00:47:13.558 --> 00:47:16.968
Yeah, I guess that's my opinion. Um I I like having a

883
00:47:16.968 --> 00:47:19.748
policy, I don't want the kids to have them. It's absolutely

884
00:47:19.748 --> 00:47:24.048
a distraction but um I I just I don't know that. I feel

885
00:47:24.048 --> 00:47:27.228
like we need to be that prescriptive to our teachers.

886
00:47:30.978 --> 00:47:34.778
I would say I I kind of agree on that. I I feel like there

887
00:47:34.778 --> 00:47:38.029
is that lag time if you're everybody's turning it on and at

888
00:47:38.029 --> 00:47:41.686
and at the same time when lunch hits or whatever. And, you

889
00:47:41.914 --> 00:47:45.378
just I I wonder about that and I think back in the day when

890
00:47:45.378 --> 00:47:47.608
when we used to, like, pay for ringtones because we thought

891
00:47:47.608 --> 00:47:51.568
that was like, I don't know that my kids phone ever makes

892
00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:54.058
noise like, I feel like for the most part I mean, I don't

893
00:47:54.058 --> 00:47:55.918
know, maybe that's just them, but

894
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:59.850
Most kids have it and I know mine said it to do not disturb

895
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:04.546
during the day, like they have it set from 7:15, to

896
00:48:04.546 --> 00:48:07.750
whatever time they get out that day on, do not disturb

897
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:08.860
automatically.

898
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.100
And that's been an expectation. We've had, um,

899
00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.870
and so, I

900
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:18.130
I do think this turning off feels a bit.

901
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.925
Over the top. Um if we're going to allow it during the

902
00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.370
other times and if they are using it during class and if

903
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.110
you don't you know like then you got to wait forever to

904
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.870
boot their phone up to then go do something. So I think

905
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.890
there are times that they do use it. Um, and I know yeah,

906
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.100
like video production they're using, but they also had

907
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.600
cameras if they needed it and that kind of thing. So,

908
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.920
I, I'm a little torn on on whether we require.

909
00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:46.380
Require the off at the high school. I do think the the

910
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:50.880
watches definitely become an issue and I think it's very

911
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.920
hard for the younger kids.

912
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.930
To understand and control that and like, without kind of

913
00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.642
firm boundaries on that, um, because yeah, I've had the

914
00:49:00.642 --> 00:49:02.850
same thing, while all of a sudden you start hearing an

915
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.346
adult talking and you're like, where are they coming from?

916
00:49:05.346 --> 00:49:07.380
And it's some kids watch.

917
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.340
So I can see that 1 being turned off. I, I just

918
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.120
I'm a little torn, I don't I whether to go all the way of

919
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.916
turning it off during the school day, um, and I do

920
00:49:17.916 --> 00:49:23.040
appreciate um, the kind of carve outs for medical

921
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.080
I know, um, students who are diabetic or stuff, you know,

922
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.760
rely on that to track blood sugar during the day, um, or it

923
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.696
might be in an IEP or 504. So, I, I glad that is there, um,

924
00:49:34.696 --> 00:49:37.240
you know, from the beginning. So that I

925
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:41.221
Say I'm a little torn on whether that the turn off or just

926
00:49:41.221 --> 00:49:44.469
put on silent, do not disturb and if you're, if it starts

927
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.256
making noise, then it's a problem that needs to get turned

928
00:49:46.257 --> 00:49:48.700
off. But if it's can be silent,

929
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.790
and then,

930
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.100
just equal.

931
00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.820
Yeah, that's a hard 1 only I know because with the Advent

932
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.420
of earbuds and the fact that they can control it and the

933
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.554
kids with long hair, you can't tell that they have it on. I

934
00:50:02.554 --> 00:50:03.839
mean so that's another

935
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.800
Complexity, like, if you don't make them turn it off. They

936
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.120
are listening to music because

937
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.390
The daughter does that when I'm talking to her?

938
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.340
What are you doing, mine? Do too right. I mean they they'll

939
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.070
leave 1 year open and you know, I'm listening to you but

940
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.612
the other 1 is anyways. So that's 1 thing. And the other

941
00:50:20.612 --> 00:50:22.359
thing I want to bring up was

942
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.260
At the middle school level. Um,

943
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.582
Because when I first saw a policy it was like complete ban

944
00:50:28.582 --> 00:50:31.690
for the day for middle school as well. And I was surprised

945
00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:35.614
that was, um, there but um, but that was based on feedback

946
00:50:35.614 --> 00:50:36.190
from

947
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:39.164
The Middle School administrators and teachers themselves,

948
00:50:39.164 --> 00:50:41.444
right? It's it's not something that we just decided.

949
00:50:41.444 --> 00:50:44.727
To put in their correct, the, uh, middle school principals

950
00:50:44.727 --> 00:50:48.473
requested to be added to the, uh, primary uh, students.

951
00:50:48.474 --> 00:50:50.394
Okay, thanks.

952
00:50:51.444 --> 00:50:56.154
Trustee Blackman. So I just having had a 1 kid, go all the

953
00:50:56.155 --> 00:50:58.492
way through the schools with cell phones. I have to say

954
00:50:58.492 --> 00:51:00.364
that. I really appreciate the fact that there were these

955
00:51:00.364 --> 00:51:02.884
cell phone Pockets at the front of the room and it got put

956
00:51:02.884 --> 00:51:05.704
away. The reason why I like that is because if you weren't

957
00:51:05.704 --> 00:51:08.644
using it, is that it was out of sight, out of mind.

958
00:51:08.644 --> 00:51:11.784
Cell phones, still transmit images during the day. And for

959
00:51:11.784 --> 00:51:14.379
anybody else seeing a table with other students, I'm sorry,

960
00:51:14.379 --> 00:51:16.644
but anybody else has their phone on with the images popping

961
00:51:16.644 --> 00:51:18.864
up, somebody sends you something you might be on silent but

962
00:51:18.864 --> 00:51:21.555
that stuff is still popping up. It's still a distraction

963
00:51:21.555 --> 00:51:24.023
for everybody else around you. The bangs, the dings and all

964
00:51:24.024 --> 00:51:26.664
that other stuff are still really annoying. But I'm also

965
00:51:26.664 --> 00:51:29.124
concerned about if we don't Institute something that

966
00:51:29.124 --> 00:51:32.124
actually creates a quiet space for when students are going

967
00:51:32.124 --> 00:51:35.604
through exams or testing because for some students having

968
00:51:35.604 --> 00:51:38.364
those auditory distractions or even visual distractions

969
00:51:38.364 --> 00:51:41.184
actually disturb their ability to actually do their work

970
00:51:41.184 --> 00:51:44.619
during those assessments. So even though we might leave it

971
00:51:44.619 --> 00:51:47.664
up to some of the teachers to figure out the best way to

972
00:51:47.664 --> 00:51:50.124
eliminate the distractions, not just for you personally.

973
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:53.004
for the other students in the room, I actually feel that we

974
00:51:53.004 --> 00:51:55.104
need to have something that's a little bit more defined for

975
00:51:55.104 --> 00:51:57.904
when we're having assessments because I am concerned if we

976
00:51:57.904 --> 00:52:00.264
leave a watch on a student. If we have somebody with a cell

977
00:52:00.264 --> 00:52:02.304
phone, if something's binging something's lighting up that

978
00:52:02.304 --> 00:52:05.004
it is kind of a distraction for others. So I'd like to see

979
00:52:05.004 --> 00:52:06.174
something that addresses that

980
00:52:06.174 --> 00:52:07.044
Thank you.

981
00:52:13.434 --> 00:52:18.094
Okay, so this is a first reading correct correct. Um,

982
00:52:18.734 --> 00:52:22.194
do you need more information from us at this point in time,

983
00:52:22.194 --> 00:52:23.154
or

984
00:52:24.234 --> 00:52:25.834
Okay.

985
00:52:26.844 --> 00:52:29.944
All righty. Thank you. All right, thank you very much.

986
00:52:30.224 --> 00:52:37.074
And next we have an update on summer. 2014, 24 learning.

987
00:52:37.074 --> 00:52:39.701
Yeah, president pelum and super 10 of funk, and Board of

988
00:52:39.718 --> 00:52:44.013
Trustees and members of the community. Um, this is, I think

989
00:52:44.014 --> 00:52:48.444
this is my favorite presentation all year. Um, this is an

990
00:52:48.444 --> 00:52:51.948
annual presentation. Let me back up. So last year, you got

991
00:52:51.948 --> 00:52:55.086
1 separate presentation on summer, school or summer

992
00:52:55.087 --> 00:52:58.644
programming. And then you have a separate presentation on

993
00:52:58.644 --> 00:53:02.094
what we did for the teachers, for, for their uh, summer

994
00:53:02.094 --> 00:53:04.616
learning. And we decided as an ed services team. And I

995
00:53:04.617 --> 00:53:06.229
thought it was a good idea. If somebody made the suggestion

996
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.784
that we just combine it into 1 presentation. So what you're

997
00:53:08.784 --> 00:53:11.604
going to see tonight is even though it's 1 slide deck. It's

998
00:53:11.604 --> 00:53:15.654
it's really 2 unique presentations. 1 is on our credit

999
00:53:15.654 --> 00:53:20.364
recovery and our esy students and then the other 1 is

1000
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:24.259
A presentation on, um, what our teachers did this summer, in

1001
00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:27.399
order to learn. So that being said, I'd like to introduce

1002
00:53:27.399 --> 00:53:31.119

1003
00:53:31.227 --> 00:53:33.765

00:53:37.939 --> 00:53:40.914

Thank you. Thank you Dr. Campbell

1018
00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:24.739
Good evening.

1019
00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:27.729
Superintendent Funk Board of Trustees. Thank you for having

1020
00:54:27.729 --> 00:54:28.569
us.

1021
00:54:28.569 --> 00:54:29.669
so,

1022
00:54:29.669 --> 00:54:34.546
This was our second summer um as the dynamic duo summer

1023
00:54:34.546 --> 00:54:39.414
school admin team. Um and so speaking to our high school

1024
00:54:39.415 --> 00:54:42.786
program, um it serves students in grades 9, through 12

1025
00:54:42.787 --> 00:54:47.016
current high school students um that were needing to either

1026
00:54:47.016 --> 00:54:49.759
recover missing credits. So they failed the class the first

1027
00:54:49.759 --> 00:54:50.339
time or

1028
00:54:50.339 --> 00:54:54.599
Or they got their credits, but that grade needed to be

1029
00:54:54.599 --> 00:54:58.049
remediated in order for them to maintain their University

1030
00:54:58.049 --> 00:55:01.739
admissions, the a3g eligibility. So perhaps the passing

1031
00:55:01.739 --> 00:55:04.259
grade was D minus through D, Plus.

1032
00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:07.589
They got their credit for graduation, but they wanted to

1033
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:10.709
tie up loose sentence. So, we had 2 groups there, um, for

1034
00:55:10.709 --> 00:55:14.309
the credit recovery program. And then we also had, um,

1035
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:17.705
extended school year for um, qualifying special education

1036
00:55:17.849 --> 00:55:21.869
students on our campus. Um, so for the DHS summer program,

1037
00:55:21.869 --> 00:55:25.429
we had self-contained core classes, um, and we required

1038
00:55:25.429 --> 00:55:29.069
daily in-person attendance. Um, and there was the

1039
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:32.249
combination of online, coursework completion, using the

1040
00:55:32.249 --> 00:55:36.299
Edgenuity platform. But also students attending daily re,

1041
00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:39.449
um, receiving additional support from classroom teachers.

1042
00:55:39.629 --> 00:55:43.769
Um, we were very excited to be able to offer uh, additional

1043
00:55:43.769 --> 00:55:48.438
English 1 and English 2 um, through a daily direct

1044
00:55:48.487 --> 00:55:52.144
instruction model. Uh, and that's just for students that

1045
00:55:52.145 --> 00:55:55.829
needed additional literacy support. Um, and also very

1046
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:59.241
excited that we were able to offer a credit recovery course

1047
00:55:59.242 --> 00:56:02.609
for Sci. Biology students and special education that

1048
00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:04.289
qualified for Sci box.

1049
00:56:04.289 --> 00:56:07.886
Ohio that needed Credit Recovery. Um and having that option

1050
00:56:07.887 --> 00:56:10.992
for them as well, with a special education, teacher

1051
00:56:10.992 --> 00:56:12.132
present.

1052
00:56:13.792 --> 00:56:18.118
A little more on the High School summer program. So, um, of

1053
00:56:18.119 --> 00:56:23.312
course it was designed for seniors right? That needed to

1054
00:56:23.312 --> 00:56:27.782
meet graduation requirements. Um, though, we also had

1055
00:56:27.782 --> 00:56:32.252
Uh, math, tutors on site. So we had 2 tutors that are

1056
00:56:32.252 --> 00:56:34.672
normally are in our arc, our tutoring center during the

1057
00:56:34.672 --> 00:56:38.372
school year and they were on site. Um, they would push in

1058
00:56:38.372 --> 00:56:41.312
to classrooms supporting students that were doing the enu

1059
00:56:41.312 --> 00:56:45.339
math, coursework. In addition to the teachers, um, we had

1060
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.572
academic support, we had social emotional counseling

1061
00:56:47.572 --> 00:56:52.124

1062
00:56:52.124 --> 00:56:55.124
uh, wellness support that students could pop into if they

1063
00:56:55.124 --> 00:56:58.257
needed to take a break, or they needed to speak with our

1064
00:56:58.258 --> 00:57:00.572
mental health clinician. And then, of course, our

1065
00:57:00.572 --> 00:57:04.352

Um, otherwise the extended school year program, this is the

1106
00:59:21.697 --> 00:59:23.377
program that is

1107
00:59:23.777 --> 00:59:27.417

1110
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:41.847
summer, it grew quite a bit. We had about 225 students. We

1111
00:59:41.847 --> 00:59:45.882
had 17 classes ranging from preschool to the transition age

1112
00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:48.822
and we were housed at Frederickson. Elementary school as

1113
00:59:48.822 --> 00:59:51.477
well as Dublin. High School campus.

1114
00:59:51.477 --> 00:59:55.853

00:59:59.317 --> 01:00:03.817
supports. We had a wonderful staff comprised of returning

1117
01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:06.737
staff members. Many of them who are teachers that are

1118
01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:09.597
working this during the school year with their students, as

1119
01:00:09.597 --> 01:00:13.562

1123
01:00:21.077 --> 01:00:25.007
had this year. Uh I think 1 of the 1 of the highlights that

1124
01:00:25.007 --> 01:00:27.297
we had was the fact that we had so many returning staff

1125
01:00:27.297 --> 01:00:30.377

1126
01:00:31.957 --> 01:00:34.667

1136
01:01:18.727 --> 01:01:22.047

1137
01:01:22.047 --> 01:01:25.357

1140
01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:31.987
lives.

1141
01:01:31.987 --> 01:01:34.745
uh some of the things that really stood out and that we

1142
01:01:34.745 --> 01:01:37.775
would like to consider um for future summer programming is

1143
01:01:37.775 --> 01:01:40.955
the graduation ceremony for our seniors who finished during

1144
01:01:40.955 --> 01:01:44.735
the summer. Is a great addition that we um started last

1145
01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:48.017
last year. Uh, this is something that we anticipate

1146
01:01:48.018 --> 01:01:53.405
continuing. It's a great way to just show. Um, show our

1147
01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:55.025
students, uh, just

1148
01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:58.295
Give them that opportunity to celebrate um, with us and

1149
01:01:58.295 --> 01:01:59.645
with their families.

1150
01:01:59.645 --> 01:02:02.815
Uh 1 of the things that uh that we added a couple of years

1151
01:02:02.815 --> 01:02:06.895
ago is a administrator specifically designated to oversee

1152
01:02:06.895 --> 01:02:10.495
our extended school year program. Um we would like to see

1153
01:02:10.495 --> 01:02:15.115
that continue as well as that is um that I was talking with

1154
01:02:15.115 --> 01:02:19.240
uh with Jennifer Keller this last week and just the amount

1155
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.845
of um

1156
01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:24.365
logistical Pieces Just for the drop off and pick up of

1157
01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:27.545
students each and every day. Uh, and the things that are

1158
01:02:27.545 --> 01:02:30.485
required to do that. It really does, uh, require a lot of

1159
01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:34.025
oversight, um, with the amount of transportation and

1160
01:02:34.025 --> 01:02:36.965
vehicles that come on to, uh, our campuses, uh, for our

1161
01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:38.435
students in esy,

1162
01:02:38.435 --> 01:02:41.655
um, we continue to seek additional credit recovery options,

1163
01:02:41.655 --> 01:02:44.367
not just during the summer but throughout the school year

1164
01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:47.850
outside of the school day, uh, so that we can continue to

1165
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.512
support our students that are, um, not quite on track for

1166
01:02:51.512 --> 01:02:54.654
graduation or credit deficient, um, to be able to help them

1167
01:02:54.655 --> 01:02:58.995
get back on track, um, for um, both a to G and also on

1168
01:02:58.995 --> 01:03:01.965
graduation track, um, as well as

1169
01:03:01.965 --> 01:03:05.535
During the summer, increasing the options that we have for

1170
01:03:05.535 --> 01:03:11.355
credit recovery. Uh this year uh we added in as Lisa said a

1171
01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:14.415
a, an in-person direct instruction element separate from

1172
01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:19.125
Edgenuity for students, that EU just doesn't work well for,

1173
01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:22.775
for, uh, we were only able to do it for a couple of our

1174
01:03:22.775 --> 01:03:25.305
our courses, and we hope to expand that work to have more

1175
01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:28.415
direct, um, instruction offerings for our students as well.

1176
01:03:28.415 --> 01:03:31.275
So, again, thank you to the 2 of you for your leadership

1177
01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.525
and launching a successful program.

1178
01:03:33.525 --> 01:03:36.855
At this time, I would like to actually curse.

1179
01:03:36.985 --> 01:03:38.315
Yep.

1180
01:03:39.405 --> 01:03:42.745
I have a question. Yeah just to clarifying question for you

1181
01:03:42.745 --> 01:03:46.915
and I don't mean to put either you or uh Dr. Campbell on

1182
01:03:46.915 --> 01:03:52.036
the spot. Um due to the reduction of the 4 million that we

1183
01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:54.875
we identify in the board approved last year, we had to

1184
01:03:54.885 --> 01:03:58.387
reduce our summer offerings, uh, and we also played some

1185
01:03:58.388 --> 01:04:00.642
Shell Games with how we funded summer school, can you

1186
01:04:00.642 --> 01:04:04.164
remind us how much summer school was and what funds we

1187
01:04:04.165 --> 01:04:05.095
used?

1188
01:04:06.378 --> 01:04:10.352
Yeah summer school costs a couple hundred thousand dollars.

1189
01:04:10.352 --> 01:04:14.187
It's I think that I budget like dollars for every summer um

1190
01:04:14.188 --> 01:04:18.418
just for this particular summer school, um the the summer

1191
01:04:18.418 --> 01:04:22.768
school we're actually the last funding for the um,

1192
01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:27.528
The Esser funds from the Biden Administration has paid for

1193
01:04:27.528 --> 01:04:30.528
summer school for the past couple of years. We knew that it

1194
01:04:30.528 --> 01:04:34.060
was going to run out at the end of this year. So looking

1195
01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:39.152
toward next summer. So the summer of 2025 we have put

1196
01:04:39.153 --> 01:04:42.852
summer school costs with our supplemental Grant. So it's

1197
01:04:42.852 --> 01:04:46.068
it's going to we know this is a a vital program and it's an

1198
01:04:46.068 --> 01:04:48.468
important program that we prioritize. And so it's going to

1199
01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.148
come out of our supplemental Grant.

1200
01:04:50.628 --> 01:04:54.528
Do you do you want to pause here to ask questions about

1201
01:04:54.528 --> 01:04:57.748
summer school? Before we go on to teacher learning? I have

1202
01:04:57.748 --> 01:05:00.208
a question. The supplemental Grant. Can you tell me more?

1203
01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:01.978
Is that a federal? Is that a state?

1204
01:05:01.978 --> 01:05:05.988
Sorry, it's educational ease. I I apologize. Uh, it comes

1205
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.682
from the state that is the money that, um, districts, get

1206
01:05:10.682 --> 01:05:12.278
in each district, gets a different amount of depends on the

1207
01:05:12.278 --> 01:05:17.570
unduplicated student count. So it's the eel Learners the,

1208
01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:20.522
um, the Foster students and the students that are on free

1209
01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:22.818
and reduced lunch. So, depending on what your percentage is

1210
01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:27.086
then, um, you get a, you get, um, you get some money back

1211
01:05:27.086 --> 01:05:30.938
for our case, Dublin, we got 3.5 million dollars, this past

1212
01:05:30.938 --> 01:05:34.358
year. For next year we're looking at about 3.8 million

1213
01:05:34.938 --> 01:05:38.722
And is it pretty open on what you can spend it on? So, we're

1214
01:05:38.722 --> 01:05:42.238
just using to spend some portion on. Sorry. Yeah. It's

1215
01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.878
primarily to support the needs of the unduplicated,

1216
01:05:44.878 --> 01:05:48.551
students. However, you can use it for students, um, for all

1217
01:05:48.564 --> 01:05:51.597
students. But it's primarily for the needs for unduplicated

1218
01:05:51.598 --> 01:05:54.958
students and this, um, using it for summer school credit

1219
01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:59.278
recovery is a is a, it's, it's an expense, it's allowable.

1220
01:06:03.218 --> 01:06:05.868
All right. Thank you.

1221
01:06:07.318 --> 01:06:11.803
Are we still on question? Yeah, okay. Great. Um, thank you

1222
01:06:11.803 --> 01:06:13.897
for the presentation. That was great. Um, on the high

1223
01:06:13.898 --> 01:06:17.018
school. Um, Credit Recovery, can you give me an idea of

1224
01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:20.948
like how many we're doing versus in the classroom? Like

1225
01:06:20.948 --> 01:06:22.958
what percent of students?

1226
01:06:24.968 --> 01:06:28.458
Just roughly right. Um,

1227
01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:37.288
I would say probably um, 80 75% um, doing the Edgenuity but

1228
01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:39.767
But of course, they're still with the teacher in the

1229
01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:43.458
classroom, right? But the the model right is on the online

1230
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:46.848
platform, but they're still coming every day. Um, and then

1231
01:06:46.848 --> 01:06:51.480
the other. Yeah, 25%. We were able to offer um the teacher

1232
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.452
teacher directed, um, all class. We're doing this together.

1233
01:06:55.452 --> 01:06:58.766
turn to page 3. So yeah. Okay. And then, so for the, I

1234
01:06:58.766 --> 01:07:01.067
think you said it, but for the Edgenuity ones, they are all

1235
01:07:01.068 --> 01:07:03.408
coming in person, doing it on like a school, district

1236
01:07:03.408 --> 01:07:04.308
Chromebook, correct with

1237
01:07:04.308 --> 01:07:07.989
That a teacher there to help it as needed, okay? But they

1238
01:07:07.989 --> 01:07:10.209
could be on all sorts of different classes. Like 1 teacher

1239
01:07:10.209 --> 01:07:11.169
could have

1240
01:07:11.169 --> 01:07:16.729
30 kids on all different Ingenuity kind of classes. Yes, we

1241
01:07:16.729 --> 01:07:21.995
did. Definitely try to group students uh together. Um, so

1242
01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:25.457
certain courses together and also teacher credential area,

1243
01:07:25.457 --> 01:07:29.316
just making sure that, um, right that we have say, for

1244
01:07:29.317 --> 01:07:32.189
example, all the math kiddos in the same room, um, and

1245
01:07:32.189 --> 01:07:35.729
being able to yeah. Okay. And, um, you talked about 2

1246
01:07:35.729 --> 01:07:39.749
different 3-e sessions, um, in a 3 week session, if I'm a

1247
01:07:39.749 --> 01:07:42.479
high schooler, am I only doing 1 class?

1248
01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:49.159
So, um, for Edgenuity, it is 1 course at a time, right? So,

1249
01:07:49.159 --> 01:07:54.179
um, it is self-paced so, um, if they finish it before, the

1250
01:07:54.179 --> 01:07:57.366
end of a 3 week session, if they have another course that

1251
01:07:57.367 --> 01:08:00.479
their counselor has recommended they do, they're welcome to

1252
01:08:00.479 --> 01:08:05.159
return to us for session 2 and start it then or some money.

1253
01:08:05.159 --> 01:08:07.379
We're impatient. And they said, nope. Yes sir, let's get me

1254
01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:09.779
started on that now. But as a high schooler, you had

1255
01:08:09.779 --> 01:08:12.366
opportunity to basically 2 classes only write correct. You

1256
01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:14.925
could do up to 2 courses in summer school courses. Um,

1257
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.698
however, if they are graduating seniors to earn their

1258
01:08:17.699 --> 01:08:21.499
diploma, right? We did make the exception for those. Um, a

1259
01:08:21.499 --> 01:08:24.899
few to do up to 3 as needed, only though, if it was to earn

1260
01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:25.829
their diploma,

1261
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.949
Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1262
01:08:31.719 --> 01:08:33.349
All right.

1263
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:37.359
Thank you, and we can keep going with the adults adult

1264
01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.329
learning. So, at this time, I'd like to invite up Casey,

1265
01:08:40.329 --> 01:08:43.491
Nissen and Ishani to talk to you about some of our adult

1266
01:08:43.492 --> 01:08:44.469
learning this summer.

1267
01:08:50.409 --> 01:08:53.929
Good evening before Ash meet and I share professional

1268
01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:56.929
learning opportunities from the summer. I'd like to begin

1269
01:08:56.929 --> 01:08:59.821
by Framing the work that has been done, leading up to where

1270
01:08:59.821 --> 01:09:03.769
we are now specifically, answering our PLC Focus questions,

1271
01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:05.869
the first 2 questions,

1272
01:09:05.869 --> 01:09:08.859
Have been a central focus of our work over the last 2

1273
01:09:09.519 --> 01:09:12.612
with respect to question 1. What do we expect our students

1274
01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:15.599
to learn? We have provided professional learning on the

1275
01:09:15.599 --> 01:09:18.159
on the effective use of adopted curriculum and

1276
01:09:18.193 --> 01:09:20.781
collectively. Develop course outlines with essential

1277
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:23.404
standards in order to provide a guaranteed and viable.

1278
01:09:23.405 --> 01:09:26.799
Curriculum for question 2, how will we know when they have

1279
01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:29.299
learned it? There has been significant work done on

1280
01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:30.879
assessment and Grading.

1281
01:09:30.879 --> 01:09:34.404
And this work in both areas has carried forward in both new

1282
01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:38.277
higher orientation and Summer Academy to ensure coherence

1283
01:09:38.277 --> 01:09:39.909
across our system.

1284
01:09:40.506 --> 01:09:45.046
This brings me to new hire orientation, an event near and

1285
01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:47.746
dear to my heart. As I have been the TV tip. Induction

1286
01:09:47.746 --> 01:09:51.406
coordinator here in Dublin for many, many years. Um, I'm in

1287
01:09:51.406 --> 01:09:54.466
a new role now, but I still love overseeing this event. Um,

1288
01:09:54.466 --> 01:09:59.026
it was a 2-day event with over 10 sessions, 20 facilitators

1289
01:09:59.026 --> 01:10:02.926
and over 60, new staff, participate participating in the

1290
01:10:02.926 --> 01:10:06.346
event, as 1 can see, the outcomes connect to our district

1291
01:10:06.346 --> 01:10:10.186
priorities and also include new Staff, feel feeling,

1292
01:10:10.186 --> 01:10:12.552
welcome and connected. So they would be ready to welcome

1293
01:10:12.553 --> 01:10:15.256
our students. On the first day of school,

1294
01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:19.406
Here are session highlights. So you could see the

1295
01:10:19.406 --> 01:10:23.306
connections to our ongoing work to highlight a few. We had

1296
01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:25.466
sessions on implicit bias,

1297
01:10:25.466 --> 01:10:28.911
The power of a guaranteed and viable, curriculum homework

1298
01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:32.596
and Grading. And of course we had a site orientation in

1299
01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:35.436
order for new staff to get acquainted with the nuts and

1300
01:10:35.436 --> 01:10:37.206
bolts of their School site.

1301
01:10:38.816 --> 01:10:44.181
The feedback was very positive with a 100% of participants

1302
01:10:44.181 --> 01:10:46.656
agreeing. The orientation was well, planned and

1303
01:10:46.656 --> 01:10:51.036
interactive, and 99% stating the orientation modeled

1304
01:10:51.036 --> 01:10:54.402
effective strategies to create an optimal learning

1305
01:10:54.403 --> 01:10:58.116
environment for students. The word cloud was created by

1306
01:10:58.116 --> 01:11:01.636
asking participants their key. Takeaways, some key words

1307
01:11:01.636 --> 01:11:04.296
that surfaced were students.

1308
01:11:04.296 --> 01:11:08.376
Help and help is used in the context um that help is

1309
01:11:08.376 --> 01:11:10.926
available, not help me.

1310
01:11:11.556 --> 01:11:15.836
Um Equity grading support and relationships and I'm sure

1311
01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:18.424
you're familiar with a wordcloud. The, the larger words

1312
01:11:18.424 --> 01:11:21.106
that are repeated are the ones that are larger.

1313
01:11:21.296 --> 01:11:25.332
Um overall it was a really positive Day 2 days of learning

1314
01:11:25.332 --> 01:11:28.776
with our new staff. So I will now turn it over to ashme to

1315
01:11:28.776 --> 01:11:31.026
share about summer Academy.

1316
01:11:34.436 --> 01:11:36.606
Thank you, Casey.

1317
01:11:36.606 --> 01:11:40.746
Summer Academy this year was offered, um, only for 1 day,

1318
01:11:40.746 --> 01:11:44.266
um, right after our new hire orientation, which is actually

1319
01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:47.781
a good segue for our new hires, um, to also take part in

1320
01:11:47.811 --> 01:11:51.406
these optional, professional learning events. Um, there

1321
01:11:51.506 --> 01:11:56.286
were about 18 sessions offered in close to 115 participants

1322
01:11:56.286 --> 01:11:59.826
again new and old who engaged in this optional

1323
01:11:59.826 --> 01:12:04.401
professional. Um, learning day as Casey mentioned already,

1324
01:12:04.401 --> 01:12:08.706
the offered sessions were aligned with the USD priorities.

1325
01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:12.163
Um, some of the sessions that were offered were glad

1326
01:12:12.164 --> 01:12:16.536
strategies for eel. Uh, eel students. Um, District adopted

1327
01:12:16.536 --> 01:12:20.931
curriculum, training has been continued, notice and note,

1328
01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:25.096
Avid collaboration, and also information on updated, um,

1329
01:12:25.096 --> 01:12:26.556
grading policies.

1330
01:12:27.116 --> 01:12:31.356
As you can see, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive

1331
01:12:31.356 --> 01:12:35.736
with 96% of participants stating that the professional

1332
01:12:35.736 --> 01:12:39.696
learning was aligned to clear learning objectives and was

1333
01:12:39.696 --> 01:12:44.196
relevant to their role. Moreover, 93% of the participants

1334
01:12:44.196 --> 01:12:47.976
also walking away with clear next steps that they plan to

1335
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.956
apply in their practice.

1336
01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:56.618
To elaborate on the feedback. Here are a few teacher quotes

1337
01:12:56.619 --> 01:13:00.716
where they have stated how their needs as a learner, what

1338
01:13:00.716 --> 01:13:04.436
addressed and met in the sessions that they attended.

1339
01:13:07.726 --> 01:13:11.966
As we move forward, we'll continue to align professional

1340
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.806
learning opportunities with identified student needs. And

1341
01:13:15.806 --> 01:13:20.186
with the district priorities. This year, the focus for both

1342
01:13:20.186 --> 01:13:24.506
district-wide PD days. The November 1st and the March 14th.

1343
01:13:24.506 --> 01:13:27.026
Will be inclusion and belonging.

1344
01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:31.246
Specifically taking a deeper dive into the third PLC

1345
01:13:31.246 --> 01:13:35.746
question, how will we respond when some students do not

1346
01:13:35.746 --> 01:13:36.766
learn?

1347
01:13:36.766 --> 01:13:41.356
This theme is connected to all dusd priorities. Our current

1348
01:13:41.356 --> 01:13:46.216
lcap. Um, and again, all the USD priorities, namely

1349
01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:50.416
curriculum and instruction Equity, PLC work and social

1350
01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:52.096
emotional Wellness.

1351
01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:57.236
Last, but not the least to conclude in the words of John

1352
01:13:57.236 --> 01:13:57.916
Hattie.

1353
01:13:57.916 --> 01:14:01.436
The effect of teachers, professional development on student

1354
01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:05.156
achievement, cannot be overstated. When teachers engage in

1355
01:14:05.156 --> 01:14:07.736
targeted, professional learning, that deepens their

1356
01:14:07.736 --> 01:14:12.296
understanding of instructional practices in hand, enhances

1357
01:14:12.296 --> 01:14:15.536
their ability to reflect on their own learning. They become

1358
01:14:15.536 --> 01:14:19.599
more effective Educators. This Effectiveness translates

1359
01:14:19.599 --> 01:14:23.155
directly into improved student outcomes as well. Taught

1360
01:14:23.156 --> 01:14:25.916
students are more likely to achieve at higher levels

1361
01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:31.041
regardless of their starting points. Therefore investing in

1362
01:14:31.041 --> 01:14:34.128
teacher, professional development is an investment in the

1363
01:14:34.129 --> 01:14:37.855
future success of all students. Thank you.

1364
01:14:39.486 --> 01:14:44.416
Thank you. Are there any questions comments?

1365
01:14:45.016 --> 01:14:49.736
Screen. I was happy to kick off the new teacher when I was

1366
01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:50.966
great to see all the

1367
01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:54.396
New Happy eager faces and and people that we brought in so

1368
01:14:54.426 --> 01:14:56.586
it's good. Good to have that and good to have everybody

1369
01:14:56.586 --> 01:15:00.026
together. I think to kind of start the year and feel

1370
01:15:00.026 --> 01:15:04.188
connected and so we want to keep doing that. Thank you. Um,

1371
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:05.016
trustee Blackman

1372
01:15:05.016 --> 01:15:09.288
Um, so I had a question when um, on the calendar is the next

1373
01:15:09.288 --> 01:15:11.789
next staff professional development day, is that in

1374
01:15:11.789 --> 01:15:15.004
October, or is that coming up in the spring? November

1375
01:15:15.004 --> 01:15:17.089
first, I think what it said, November 1st and then 1 in

1376
01:15:17.089 --> 01:15:19.609
March, okay. It just, that was my 1 question.

1377
01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:23.869
All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1378
01:15:24.289 --> 01:15:25.649
oh,

1379
01:15:25.649 --> 01:15:28.099
all right. Do we have comments?

1380
01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:32.071
I know I asked questions but I didn't understand if we have

1381
01:15:32.071 --> 01:15:36.679
public comments on the okay. So can we make a comment? Um

1382
01:15:36.679 --> 01:15:40.759
sure thank you. So I want I want to thank the work that

1383
01:15:40.759 --> 01:15:42.259
occurs during the summer.

1384
01:15:42.259 --> 01:15:45.549
It's very important for our new staff to feel connected.

1385
01:15:45.549 --> 01:15:49.747
I would ask at the November PD, if we could address some of

1386
01:15:49.747 --> 01:15:53.029
the confusion surrounding about starting the new year and

1387
01:15:53.029 --> 01:15:53.809
Grading,

1388
01:15:53.809 --> 01:15:57.679
We have issues across our schools with the ability to

1389
01:15:57.679 --> 01:16:01.879
implement our grading system, especially applying it to the

1390
01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:04.999
rubrics. Teachers are making up their own system because

1391
01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:07.834
they don't understand how to apply our new grading

1392
01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:11.299
standards to rubrics. So it would be something to bring up

1393
01:16:11.299 --> 01:16:13.951
in November with staff. I think it would greatly help. Some

1394
01:16:13.951 --> 01:16:15.559
of our teachers. Thank you.

1395
01:16:18.289 --> 01:16:23.909
Okay. All right. Moving on. We have HR with

1396
01:16:23.909 --> 01:16:26.739
a lot of board policies.

1397
01:16:26.739 --> 01:16:30.236
That I know everyone in the state I think is doing right

1398
01:16:30.236 --> 01:16:31.208
about now.

1399
01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:35.739
Good evening, and thank you. Um, I'm here tonight with a

1400
01:16:35.739 --> 01:16:38.559
partner. Uh, we've been working on a presentation to share

1401
01:16:38.559 --> 01:16:41.889
with you this evening regarding updates revisions and new

1402
01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.819
policies and procedures that either are Title 9 policies,

1403
01:16:45.819 --> 01:16:49.119
or relate to Title, 9 policies. All of these policies are

1404
01:16:49.119 --> 01:16:51.609
required and we look forward to talking to you about that.

1405
01:16:52.619 --> 01:16:56.619
Good evening. Um, I know Heather will be going over these

1406
01:16:56.619 --> 01:16:59.139
policies, and I'll be more than happy to answer any

1407
01:16:59.139 --> 01:17:01.089
questions that our student related as well.

1408
01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:03.629
Thank you.

1409
01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:10.574
So as you can see, from the background provided in the um

1410
01:17:10.704 --> 01:17:14.778
board agenda item, we are coming this evening to update you

1411
01:17:14.779 --> 01:17:17.999
on new updated title, 9 policies that became effective on

1412
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.319
August 1st. And any Associated policies that need to be

1413
01:17:22.319 --> 01:17:24.479
updated in relation to that.

1414
01:17:24.479 --> 01:17:28.899
I will be talking through those pre um, policies with you

1415
01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:33.819
in a presentation. And do I have the ability to bring that

1416
01:17:33.819 --> 01:17:36.609
up or keoki? Do you do that for me?

1417
01:17:37.162 --> 01:17:39.392
Or someone in the back.

1418
01:17:39.392 --> 01:17:40.632
Thank you.

1419
01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:43.562
It's all the way at the bottom.

1420
01:17:43.562 --> 01:17:45.982
The very last attachment.

1421
01:17:47.102 --> 01:17:51.432
and if you can go to presentation mode,

1422
01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:12.882
thank you. Am I able to advance the slide myself?

1423
01:18:12.882 --> 01:18:16.992
Perfect. All right. Wonderful as I stated earlier, um,

1424
01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:20.232
Marco and I have been working on the presentation and we

1425
01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:22.512
look forward to providing you a summary.

1426
01:18:22.512 --> 01:18:25.854
So, a few little updates on the background of Title 9. As

1427
01:18:25.854 --> 01:18:29.196
you might recall um about 4 years ago title name policies

1428
01:18:29.196 --> 01:18:33.432
were updated significantly in 2020 and effective August

1429
01:18:33.432 --> 01:18:36.522
August 1st. We have some updates to those policies,

1430
01:18:36.522 --> 01:18:41.562
particularly related around new non-discrimination, um,

1431
01:18:41.562 --> 01:18:45.172
procedures and additionally, an expansion of the definition

1432
01:18:45.172 --> 01:18:47.922
of harassment that can occur around being discriminated,

1433
01:18:47.922 --> 01:18:51.182
against based on your sex characteristics, gender,

1434
01:18:51.182 --> 01:18:54.462
identity, sexual orientation and I'll explain a little bit

1435
01:18:54.462 --> 01:18:56.922
more about that as we go along.

1436
01:18:56.922 --> 01:18:59.752
I do want to emphasize that discrimination has also been

1437
01:18:59.752 --> 01:19:03.196
expanded to include sex. Stereotypes pregnancy and related

1438
01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:04.432
conditions.

1439
01:19:04.432 --> 01:19:07.982
There are a number of ways now that a complaint or a

1440
01:19:07.982 --> 01:19:10.842
concern that comes our way or that we become aware of will

1441
01:19:10.842 --> 01:19:13.630
qualify under Title 9 and require investigating under those

1442
01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:17.744
policies as opposed to in the 2020 regulations. It was a

1443
01:19:17.745 --> 01:19:22.106
bit more stringent and difficult to qualify under Title 9.

1444
01:19:22.106 --> 01:19:24.602
Although there were a number of other policies we would um

1445
01:19:24.602 --> 01:19:29.162
investigate particularly in the UCP around uh sex

1446
01:19:29.162 --> 01:19:31.082
harassment claim that might come forward.

1447
01:19:32.022 --> 01:19:34.897
Just a list of the policies that we're bringing forward

1448
01:19:34.897 --> 01:19:36.902
tonight, which I'm going to describe briefly as I go

1449
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:38.632
through the next slides.

1450
01:19:38.632 --> 01:19:43.938
The um policies that are in the 4000 series will be staff

1451
01:19:43.938 --> 01:19:48.162
policies. The 5000 series will be student policies and then

1452
01:19:48.162 --> 01:19:50.862
any other policies with different numbers? Uh, tend to be

1453
01:19:50.862 --> 01:19:55.602
more generic as, in example of non-discrimination and UCP.

1454
01:19:57.222 --> 01:20:02.074
I think 1 of the pieces to really take under consideration

1455
01:20:02.074 --> 01:20:06.202
are the key takeaways um, or some essential takeaways in

1456
01:20:06.322 --> 01:20:08.499
the policies that I'm just going to highlight for you,

1457
01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:13.161
briefly 1 is that, uh, complaint filing is much easier.

1458
01:20:13.162 --> 01:20:14.062
Now,

1459
01:20:14.062 --> 01:20:17.493
Particularly related to the fact that if we hear something

1460
01:20:17.493 --> 01:20:20.583
or we see something in writing, whether or not you tell us,

1461
01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:23.907
you want to um, have it filed under that policy. We need to

1462
01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:26.763
take note of that and then streamline the way that you can

1463
01:20:26.763 --> 01:20:29.763
get that, um, procedure followed up on.

1464
01:20:29.763 --> 01:20:32.193
Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, there's a broader

1465
01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:36.448
harassment definition that includes, um, the way in which

1466
01:20:36.448 --> 01:20:40.273
we determine whether or not it will qualify under the 2029

1467
01:20:40.273 --> 01:20:44.473
policies. It had to be both subjectively and if objectively

1468
01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:50.773
offensive and severe or pervasive, um, now it can also just

1469
01:20:50.773 --> 01:20:54.913
be objectively offensive. So we use some broader,

1470
01:20:54.913 --> 01:20:58.528
definitions to explain how it may, or may not qualify. And

1471
01:20:58.528 --> 01:21:01.264
then as I mentioned earlier the expanded protections around

1472
01:21:01.265 --> 01:21:05.023
gender identity sexual orientation, sexual stereotypes

1473
01:21:05.023 --> 01:21:08.413
which we are seeing come up a bit already this year and

1474
01:21:08.413 --> 01:21:11.293
then characteristic sex characteristics.

1475
01:21:11.293 --> 01:21:14.768
A new piece of the title 9 policies includes accommodations

1476
01:21:14.768 --> 01:21:18.155
related to pregnancy that requires that for pregnant

1477
01:21:18.155 --> 01:21:22.283
students and employees that we assure them of not being

1478
01:21:22.283 --> 01:21:25.376
discriminated against within our Leah, which is our school

1479
01:21:25.376 --> 01:21:26.272
district.

1480
01:21:26.273 --> 01:21:29.383
And there's a much broader expansion of training

1481
01:21:29.383 --> 01:21:32.843
requirements. So now we are required to train all

1482
01:21:32.843 --> 01:21:36.143
employees, annually on Title, 9 and sex, discrimination

1483
01:21:36.143 --> 01:21:39.773
policies and procedures. Additionally, there's an expanded

1484
01:21:39.773 --> 01:21:43.223
training component that includes those that are directly

1485
01:21:43.223 --> 01:21:48.323
involved in Title, 9 policies, 1 would be sort of an upper

1486
01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:51.593
um, level of who might be involved in investigating, or

1487
01:21:51.593 --> 01:21:54.648
researching those policies, assistant soups soups. Some of

1488
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:58.443
those people that are working directly on it directors. And

1489
01:21:58.443 --> 01:22:00.854
then there's a level in the middle that includes people

1490
01:22:00.863 --> 01:22:04.163
that are categorized as confidential employees. They're not

1491
01:22:04.163 --> 01:22:07.223
necessarily what we would categorize as confidential

1492
01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:10.223
employees. Typically, there are those employees that might

1493
01:22:10.391 --> 01:22:14.663
um, be privy to or around people who might be talking to

1494
01:22:14.683 --> 01:22:17.229
them about things like this that could occur to them.

1495
01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:19.883
Typically, some of those folks will include your Council

1496
01:22:19.883 --> 01:22:22.943
counselors and mental health staff, so they have a

1497
01:22:22.943 --> 01:22:26.435
specifically designed training. And then, lastly, um, all

1498
01:22:26.436 --> 01:22:26.453
the

1499
01:22:26.453 --> 01:22:27.543
Students.

1500
01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:30.803
Need to have age appropriate training and information

1501
01:22:30.803 --> 01:22:33.513
provided. All of those trainings have either been completed

1502
01:22:33.513 --> 01:22:35.233
or are currently underway.

1503
01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:40.063
The other piece that's really important Within These

1504
01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:43.783
policies is the grievance procedures. So, with the title 9

1505
01:22:43.783 --> 01:22:47.947
policy violation, we have new administrative regulations

1506
01:22:47.947 --> 01:22:50.563
regulations that talk about what the grievance procedures

1507
01:22:50.563 --> 01:22:54.203
will include and I provided you, with some updates. There

1508
01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:56.233
there's a, a scope of the definition.

1509
01:22:56.233 --> 01:23:00.484
The way that we respond to and support victims, um what the

1510
01:23:00.485 --> 01:23:03.335
procedures involve particularly around something new,

1511
01:23:03.335 --> 01:23:07.115
that's called an informal resolution process. So when a

1512
01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:09.652
complaint comes in and we decide or determine that it does

1513
01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:13.264
qualify under Title 9, we have the opportunity to First

1514
01:23:13.265 --> 01:23:16.415
determine whether or not both the respondent, the people

1515
01:23:16.415 --> 01:23:18.995
that have been accused of something, the complainant those

1516
01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:21.715
that have brought the concerns forward are interested in

1517
01:23:21.715 --> 01:23:25.145
and willing to consider an informal resolution process.

1518
01:23:25.145 --> 01:23:29.325
We have to identify supportive measures. Um, of course, as

1519
01:23:29.325 --> 01:23:33.225
always not necessarily new, we have to ensure that, um,

1520
01:23:33.225 --> 01:23:36.945
victims and those that are responding to those claims are

1521
01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:39.945
not retaliated against, there's the expansion of the

1522
01:23:39.945 --> 01:23:42.375
pregnancy and related accommodations, and then the training

1523
01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:44.475
requirements that I mentioned earlier,

1524
01:23:44.475 --> 01:23:48.605
This slide talks a bit about student policy updates.

1525
01:23:48.605 --> 01:23:52.747
A big component of the updates. Within Title, 9 includes an

1526
01:23:52.747 --> 01:23:56.469
entirely new update to non-discrimination. There's a policy

1527
01:23:56.470 --> 01:24:00.925
specific to title non non-discrimination. Um, and

1528
01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:04.255
additionally, we have an expanded. Um,

1529
01:24:04.255 --> 01:24:08.382
Guidance around requirements for locating, those postings.

1530
01:24:08.382 --> 01:24:11.860
Making sure they're very transparent. We have to include,

1531
01:24:11.861 --> 01:24:15.305
um, them on our website, which we did before, but we have a

1532
01:24:15.305 --> 01:24:18.725
broader, um, understanding now of where we have to put

1533
01:24:18.725 --> 01:24:20.165
those items.

1534
01:24:20.165 --> 01:24:24.975
And then, um, an expansion around. Um, the pregnancy and

1535
01:24:25.015 --> 01:24:28.128
child birth, which I explained to include uh, married

1536
01:24:28.128 --> 01:24:30.074
pregnant or parenting students.

1537
01:24:31.325 --> 01:24:35.925
The policy updates related to employee again. Expand the

1538
01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:39.105
non-discrimination piece we have, um, the

1539
01:24:39.105 --> 01:24:41.400
non-discrimination policy that was already in place. The

1540
01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.675
4030 we have, um, expansion around, lactation

1541
01:24:44.675 --> 01:24:49.065
accommodations. And then, um, updated policies related to

1542
01:24:49.065 --> 01:24:52.095
sex discrimination and sex-based harassment.

1543
01:24:52.095 --> 01:24:55.197
Are uniform, complaint procedures coming forward tonight

1544
01:24:55.197 --> 01:24:56.644
with an update.

1545
01:24:56.645 --> 01:25:00.975
And um, further non-discrimination and and uh

1546
01:25:00.975 --> 01:25:04.275
discrimination around District programs and activities.

1547
01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:08.535
because we need to ensure that because of an allegation

1548
01:25:08.535 --> 01:25:11.316
that may be made or someone is victimized by something

1549
01:25:11.316 --> 01:25:14.219
that's included within Title 9 that they are not

1550
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.895
discriminated against in a way that wouldn't, um, involve

1551
01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:22.320
not being able to access a program at work, a program at

1552
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.135
school or the instructional program.

1553
01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:29.455
That's a general policy. Kind of overview of everything

1554
01:25:29.455 --> 01:25:32.008
that's coming forward. We'd love to answer any questions

1555
01:25:32.008 --> 01:25:35.399
that you have. You can see, um, if you add them up, we've

1556
01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.225
got about 38 updates, or new policies and regulations. So

1557
01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:42.840
hope that um we've provided you with enough of a summary

1558
01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.249
and we're here to answer any questions that you may have

1559
01:25:45.249 --> 01:25:47.871
and Marco and I are probably going to tag team and that a

1560
01:25:47.871 --> 01:25:48.734
little bit

1561
01:25:48.735 --> 01:25:51.066
I was going to start off. Do we have any public comment on

1562
01:25:51.066 --> 01:25:52.506
this item?

1563
01:25:52.506 --> 01:25:55.451
Okay, and if there's anyone who wishes to make public

1564
01:25:55.451 --> 01:25:59.025
comment, please log on in the next minute or 2 to do so,

1565
01:25:59.026 --> 01:26:00.406
um, we can do that.

1566
01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:03.886
um, any questions from board members right now, trustee

1567
01:26:03.886 --> 01:26:05.416
Blackman and then trustee quo,

1568
01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:07.626
So, I probably have a couple questions while I asked some

1569
01:26:07.626 --> 01:26:10.576
now. So, I understand this is being rolled out by the

1570
01:26:10.576 --> 01:26:13.486
Department of Education and part of something is presented

1571
01:26:13.486 --> 01:26:16.096
to us. A while ago, is that it's actually tied to Federal

1572
01:26:16.096 --> 01:26:19.036
funding for schools specific to the programs that are

1573
01:26:19.036 --> 01:26:20.986
federally funded correct

1574
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.551
That is a piece of of the regulation, that's coming

1575
01:26:24.551 --> 01:26:27.602
forward. Yes. So have, we received anything from the

1576
01:26:27.602 --> 01:26:30.686
federal government stating that failure to enact the

1577
01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.986
changes in Title 9, will result in them pulling funds from

1578
01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:36.446
our school or our district. So they haven't issued

1579
01:26:36.446 --> 01:26:40.226
anything. Stating that the that this is, okay? I'm seeing,

1580
01:26:40.226 --> 01:26:43.190
um, assistant superintendent, Campbell shake its head, you

1581
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.496
know? And I, I have not seen anything. No, not nor am I

1582
01:26:46.496 --> 01:26:49.514
aware of that at this time. So I'm gonna ask a couple

1583
01:26:49.514 --> 01:26:51.626
questions and I'll probably let somebody else and come

1584
01:26:51.626 --> 01:26:54.026
back. Um, the next question is, do we actually have any

1585
01:26:54.026 --> 01:26:55.676
evidence? Um, well

1586
01:26:55.676 --> 01:26:59.166
Who approves changes to law?

1587
01:26:59.166 --> 01:27:02.721
And maybe this is profun by asking it, but I have to ask it

1588
01:27:02.736 --> 01:27:06.416
because it's we're being asked to update Title 9 and I'm

1589
01:27:06.416 --> 01:27:09.426
going to ask if Congress is actually approved. The changes

1590
01:27:09.426 --> 01:27:10.536
to the law.

1591
01:27:10.996 --> 01:27:14.876
If anybody knows that answer, that would be most helpful.

1592
01:27:14.926 --> 01:27:20.186
So the regulations are they come out of the Department of

1593
01:27:20.186 --> 01:27:24.686
Education tied to the funding that is, uh, provided by the

1594
01:27:24.686 --> 01:27:28.166
Department of Education. So, in the overall Congress

1595
01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:30.806
budget, they allocate so much money to the Department of

1596
01:27:30.806 --> 01:27:33.962
Education and the department determines how they're going

1597
01:27:33.962 --> 01:27:37.766
to divvy that up and they determine the regs, that govern

1598
01:27:37.766 --> 01:27:39.626
the money that's received.

1599
01:27:39.626 --> 01:27:43.284
So no indirectly. The Congress does not pass the regs that

1600
01:27:43.284 --> 01:27:47.636
come out of the Department of um, education. Okay, so Town

1601
01:27:47.636 --> 01:27:49.176
9 is a regulation. It's not law.

1602
01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:56.986
Oh no, there are federal laws. Um, but if you read through

1603
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.986
each of these policies, you'll see which ones are regs and

1604
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.226
which ones are laws, the laws are approved by the Congress,

1605
01:28:03.226 --> 01:28:05.896
the regs come out of the Department of Ed.

1606
01:28:05.896 --> 01:28:08.826
I, I just want the reason why I asked the clarification is

1607
01:28:08.826 --> 01:28:11.126
to try and understand, um,

1608
01:28:11.126 --> 01:28:14.926
Where we stand with enacting the changes, if aspects of it,

1609
01:28:14.926 --> 01:28:16.906
have not been approved by Congress.

1610
01:28:22.526 --> 01:28:26.406
Sorry. I'm sure I can comment on that right now trustee

1611
01:28:26.406 --> 01:28:28.686
Blackman, but I can look into that and Marco and I can

1612
01:28:28.686 --> 01:28:32.539
bring some information back to you. What I would say in

1613
01:28:32.539 --> 01:28:35.585
connection to what superintendent Funk said is yes the

1614
01:28:35.749 --> 01:28:38.756
Department of Education is involved but also Title 9 as I

1615
01:28:38.756 --> 01:28:42.605
think we all know, as a federal law that, um, specifically

1616
01:28:42.626 --> 01:28:45.398
prohibits certain types, of behavior. And then

1617
01:28:45.398 --> 01:28:47.785
additionally, with all of these policies and procedures

1618
01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:51.306
coming out of csba and updates related to that, there are a

1619
01:28:51.306 --> 01:28:54.546
number of assembly bills, Senate bills, other legal, um,

1620
01:28:54.546 --> 01:28:57.657
parameters that feed into the policies that we're updating

1621
01:28:57.657 --> 01:28:58.535
tonight.

1622
01:28:58.845 --> 01:29:02.245
Okay, that's helpful. I'll I'll see the floor for now. I

1623
01:29:02.245 --> 01:29:03.925
have other questions. I'll ask them later.

1624
01:29:08.085 --> 01:29:12.025
I was just curious about the timeline between the feds

1625
01:29:12.025 --> 01:29:16.225
regulation that was released in April and then when did csb

1626
01:29:16.225 --> 01:29:18.625
come out with theirs and then now we're doing it.

1627
01:29:18.625 --> 01:29:21.848
In septembar, is it? I imagine it was because we're waiting

1628
01:29:21.849 --> 01:29:24.815
on csba. Thank you. I think that's a very good question.

1629
01:29:24.815 --> 01:29:26.975
You know we were waiting for all of the guidelines to be

1630
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.287
provided to us. In fact some of the updates were available

1631
01:29:30.287 --> 01:29:33.875
from csba but new policies. We actually didn't even have

1632
01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:37.295
from csba this summer and we're waiting for them to come

1633
01:29:37.295 --> 01:29:40.145
into play. So we were starting to implement some of this

1634
01:29:40.145 --> 01:29:43.365
work and plan for it based on what we knew was coming down.

1635
01:29:43.365 --> 01:29:47.003
Um and then to get all the policies ready to update for you

1636
01:29:47.003 --> 01:29:48.965
and here we are.

1637
01:29:48.965 --> 01:29:50.235
Thank you.

1638
01:29:50.235 --> 01:29:54.381
Can I just build on that? So you have all of the ones you,

1639
01:29:54.381 --> 01:29:57.645
um, brought to us. You did get something from csba on them.

1640
01:29:57.645 --> 01:30:00.885
Yes bye. Bye, this point. Okay, it's just peace me. I

1641
01:30:00.885 --> 01:30:03.925
assumed they were coming in. Okay. Uh in some cases yes the

1642
01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:06.870
new policy around non-discrimination was something that we

1643
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:09.525
had to work a little bit more closely with legal on in

1644
01:30:09.625 --> 01:30:13.045
order to get a draft working and then when csb came out

1645
01:30:13.045 --> 01:30:16.405
came out, we um, connected the 2. But we were already

1646
01:30:16.405 --> 01:30:18.805
drafting it in advance because we didn't get to want to get

1647
01:30:18.805 --> 01:30:22.965
too far beyond the August 1 timeline, okay? And so we use

1648
01:30:22.965 --> 01:30:27.285
the guidelines from csba and then are there any that we had

1649
01:30:27.285 --> 01:30:28.515
to get our own legal?

1650
01:30:28.515 --> 01:30:31.875
Um, involvement in or did we have enough guidance from csba

1651
01:30:31.875 --> 01:30:32.925
to go off of?

1652
01:30:33.185 --> 01:30:36.915
Ultimately, we had guidance from csba on everything I'm

1653
01:30:36.915 --> 01:30:39.585
looking at the policies to see which 1, I think it's the

1654
01:30:39.585 --> 01:30:42.405
0410 on the slide that we're on right now.

1655
01:30:43.255 --> 01:30:45.125
Excuse me.

1656
01:30:45.125 --> 01:30:48.755
yeah, the 0410 is the policy that we were beginning to

1657
01:30:48.755 --> 01:30:51.331
draft on our own and then had legal weigh in and then

1658
01:30:51.331 --> 01:30:54.355
updated for csba when it came out and

1659
01:30:54.355 --> 01:30:58.205
Gosh, it came out in August. Okay, great. Thank you. You're

1660
01:30:58.206 --> 01:30:58.695
welcome.

1661
01:30:59.695 --> 01:31:03.695
And just I I was looking at another.

1662
01:31:03.695 --> 01:31:06.760
School District board agenda for the this meeting tonight

1663
01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:10.355
and they have virtually the same exact board policy. We

1664
01:31:10.355 --> 01:31:13.255
might have talked to each other. Yes, yes. Um, on the

1665
01:31:13.255 --> 01:31:15.811
agenda tonight and I know it's been a topic of discussion

1666
01:31:15.811 --> 01:31:19.195
at multiple districts. Um, so the expectation is because

1667
01:31:19.195 --> 01:31:23.155
this all went in it, you know, April or August 1st that we

1668
01:31:23.155 --> 01:31:27.295
should now be then updating all of these. Um, in order to

1669
01:31:27.295 --> 01:31:28.855
be in compliance with

1670
01:31:29.588 --> 01:31:33.138
State laws and federal regulations precisely.

1671
01:31:36.698 --> 01:31:39.108
Any other trustee Luckman.

1672
01:31:39.308 --> 01:31:42.228
Just go up with some questions and some of the changes that

1673
01:31:42.228 --> 01:31:45.576
were brought about by the update. The 2024 update to Town

1674
01:31:45.576 --> 01:31:48.508
Line there are 2 terms that I would like if you could

1675
01:31:48.508 --> 01:31:51.948
explain the definition of them that would be helpful, 6

1676
01:31:51.948 --> 01:31:54.588
stereotypes and sex characteristics. Those are new to the

1677
01:31:54.588 --> 01:31:55.488
language.

1678
01:32:01.878 --> 01:32:06.443
I'll take the, um, stereotypes and you just let us know

1679
01:32:06.478 --> 01:32:08.998
which, uh, policy representing, please? Yeah. It's

1680
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.262
actually, in almost all of them. Usually in the first 2

1681
01:32:12.262 --> 01:32:15.310
paragraphs. There's something about a list and it includes

1682
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:18.778
changes, which include things like marital family. Status,

1683
01:32:18.778 --> 01:32:21.994
lactation Etc, goes on in, in almost, always it lists. The

1684
01:32:21.994 --> 01:32:25.404
sex stereotypes and sex characteristics. I think in the

1685
01:32:25.405 --> 01:32:27.898
typical language we've seen used in the last couple of

1686
01:32:27.898 --> 01:32:30.872
years. All the other terms are very common. I don't think

1687
01:32:30.872 --> 01:32:33.597
these 2 are commonly understood.

1688
01:32:33.628 --> 01:32:37.580
As sex stereotypes. Um, in fact, we're working on

1689
01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:42.088
something. Uh, thank you recently where, um, someone makes

1690
01:32:42.088 --> 01:32:47.243
a comment about, um, a person's gender that references the

1691
01:32:47.243 --> 01:32:52.095
way, um, their, their specific gender and might be a

1692
01:32:52.096 --> 01:32:56.228
stereotype to that, uh, there are a lot of terms that

1693
01:32:56.228 --> 01:32:58.808
people use for, for instance, to maybe describe.

1694
01:32:58.888 --> 01:33:02.988
Males or people who identify as male or females, or people

1695
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.428
who identify as females that stereotypes them in a way

1696
01:33:06.428 --> 01:33:07.508
that's derogatory.

1697
01:33:07.508 --> 01:33:10.118
Um, I'm trying to think of an example. I don't want to give

1698
01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:12.398
the example that we're working on right now because I, I

1699
01:33:12.398 --> 01:33:15.878
need to hold that confidentially. Um, but I think any

1700
01:33:15.878 --> 01:33:18.398
number of us right now are thinking of terms that people

1701
01:33:18.398 --> 01:33:21.406
have used in our heads of the way. That folks might

1702
01:33:21.407 --> 01:33:23.543
stereotype us because of the gender they believe we're in

1703
01:33:23.543 --> 01:33:28.118
and it's derogatory. Um, characteristics. Um, sex

1704
01:33:28.118 --> 01:33:30.638
characteristics, do you want to chime in there?

1705
01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:33.358
Yeah, I'd be more than happy to give you my best

1706
01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:36.438
interpretation of it and can report back later. Uh but uh

1707
01:33:36.438 --> 01:33:39.348
something that comes up is disposition um characteristics

1708
01:33:39.348 --> 01:33:42.258
of appearance. Um those are 2 items that come up.

1709
01:33:42.258 --> 01:33:43.388
Yeah.

1710
01:33:43.398 --> 01:33:46.486
So the reason why I ask is because there's love confusion

1711
01:33:46.486 --> 01:33:49.978
about the term gender and sex. Sex characteristics isn't

1712
01:33:49.978 --> 01:33:51.358
gender identity related.

1713
01:33:51.358 --> 01:33:54.888
So when we use the term, somebody who presents themselves

1714
01:33:54.888 --> 01:33:57.888
as say, female or male, that's actually sex related, not

1715
01:33:57.888 --> 01:34:01.345
gender. And that would be in the a woman versus man would

1716
01:34:01.346 --> 01:34:03.528
be a gender identity, and the weight 1 would want to

1717
01:34:03.528 --> 01:34:06.468
express themselves. So I want to make sure that if we're

1718
01:34:06.468 --> 01:34:09.168
providing some clarification as to the definition that it's

1719
01:34:09.168 --> 01:34:12.510
very clear that those the use of the terms is very clear

1720
01:34:12.511 --> 01:34:15.708
and consistent. So if you could come back with what those

1721
01:34:15.708 --> 01:34:18.588
are defined, as I know, I would help understand what it

1722
01:34:18.588 --> 01:34:21.939
means because I really don't and I want to thank you. Well

1723
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:22.428
certainly

1724
01:34:27.331 --> 01:34:30.647
Any other do we have? Any anyone login for public comment?

1725
01:34:30.647 --> 01:34:31.691
Nope. Okay.

1726
01:34:32.671 --> 01:34:35.841
so, um,

1727
01:34:35.841 --> 01:34:39.171
I want to reserve comments. Um, I'm a little concerned with

1728
01:34:39.171 --> 01:34:42.591
this and actually any District absorbing these right now.

1729
01:34:42.591 --> 01:34:46.021
Um because there are several large lawsuits that are

1730
01:34:46.021 --> 01:34:48.151
underway in the federal courts and the recent decision

1731
01:34:48.151 --> 01:34:51.391
August 16th by the Supreme Court of the United States to

1732
01:34:51.391 --> 01:34:55.771
allow the court cases to go through, not to suspend aspects

1733
01:34:55.771 --> 01:34:59.371
of those court cases to allow the rest of the new title,

1734
01:34:59.371 --> 01:35:03.691
um, 9 to be accepted, but rather to hold all of those

1735
01:35:03.691 --> 01:35:07.135
changes. Until these, uh, there's 3 pretty large court,

1736
01:35:07.135 --> 01:35:10.711
cases affecting 26 States and 1 court case affects

1737
01:35:10.711 --> 01:35:12.031
essentially every state.

1738
01:35:12.031 --> 01:35:16.021
So my concern is by absorbing these changes. Now, knowing

1739
01:35:16.021 --> 01:35:18.801
that scotus is already turned it down. Saying that the

1740
01:35:18.801 --> 01:35:21.441
actual individuals who have brought these cases have

1741
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:22.341
standing,

1742
01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:25.671
And given the actual details of that standing and what the

1743
01:35:25.671 --> 01:35:28.941
statements were from the courts. I'm concerned absorbing

1744
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:31.683
any of these changes right now because in all likelihood

1745
01:35:31.683 --> 01:35:34.460
within the next year, many of the things we're absorbing

1746
01:35:34.461 --> 01:35:37.768
right now will actually be rendered under judicial review

1747
01:35:37.768 --> 01:35:41.300
is not acceptable. 1 of the clear statements by the courts.

1748
01:35:41.301 --> 01:35:44.421
Is that the definition of Sex and the origination of Title

1749
01:35:44.421 --> 01:35:49.311
9 was very clear absorbing and changing that definition to

1750
01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:52.401
absorb other rights and conditions Act.

1751
01:35:52.401 --> 01:35:56.661
Actually is seen by the courts is not actually file

1752
01:35:56.661 --> 01:35:58.911
following the original intent of Title 9.

1753
01:35:58.911 --> 01:36:02.871
So, whereas we probably need titles or other regulations to

1754
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:06.171
address those needs for those individuals, the courts May,

1755
01:36:06.171 --> 01:36:08.331
and I think I'm concerned right now. We have a supreme

1756
01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:10.341
court that is very sympathetic to this.

1757
01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:13.506
So my concern is moving ahead with changes when in fact in

1758
01:36:13.506 --> 01:36:15.902
the next couple of months, who knows what's going to happen

1759
01:36:15.941 --> 01:36:18.421
with the election. But certainly in these court cases, we

1760
01:36:18.421 --> 01:36:22.241
may end up being reverting or coming back to all of these

1761
01:36:22.241 --> 01:36:25.505
pieces. So I would ask before we move ahead to quickly that

1762
01:36:25.505 --> 01:36:28.241
we might actually want to get some feedback on where we

1763
01:36:28.241 --> 01:36:31.961
stand should the reading, and maybe we need a legal expert

1764
01:36:31.961 --> 01:36:35.681
in either a federal judicial review to give us an update as

1765
01:36:35.681 --> 01:36:38.561
to whether they think in fact, some of this is actually

1766
01:36:38.573 --> 01:36:41.777
heading to be reversed in some ways. I said that because I

1767
01:36:41.777 --> 01:36:43.721
just don't want to be back here having to redo this all

1768
01:36:43.721 --> 01:36:46.613
over again. We spent a lot of time on it to begin with. Um,

1769
01:36:46.613 --> 01:36:49.623
I'm am a little surprised given some of the legal reviews

1770
01:36:49.623 --> 01:36:54.080
of the changes, the fact that there were 2, roughly, 250

1771
01:36:54.081 --> 01:36:57.281
revisions done to create the final document we have seen

1772
01:36:57.281 --> 01:36:59.651
and thousands and thousands of public comments.

1773
01:36:59.651 --> 01:37:02.573
Um, my understanding is that the very last review that was

1774
01:37:02.573 --> 01:37:06.013
supposed to be issued was halted and that this new title 9

1775
01:37:06.013 --> 01:37:07.283
was issued.

1776
01:37:07.283 --> 01:37:11.093
And the latest information is that now it's created a whole

1777
01:37:11.093 --> 01:37:13.265
series of court cases and when these court cases roll

1778
01:37:13.265 --> 01:37:14.873
through they're going to be more

1779
01:37:14.873 --> 01:37:17.373
So, whereas I would like us. There's some really good

1780
01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:20.493
policies in here. I love the family piece, the lactation

1781
01:37:20.493 --> 01:37:23.145
piece and the protections for uh, our pregnant students.

1782
01:37:23.157 --> 01:37:25.068
Some of those things have never been addressed before and

1783
01:37:25.068 --> 01:37:27.512
they're wonderful. But I do understand that there are

1784
01:37:27.513 --> 01:37:31.003
certain things that people feel there are changes. The

1785
01:37:31.003 --> 01:37:33.550
speed is you mentioned about how we're able to process

1786
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:38.172
these issues faster actually trampled on due process that

1787
01:37:38.173 --> 01:37:41.593
in a court case would actually allow the individual who is

1788
01:37:41.593 --> 01:37:44.025
being accused to actually have a greater level of due

1789
01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:47.799
process so there are concerns at that level as well. There

1790
01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.933
are free speech issues. They're first amendment issues that

1791
01:37:51.943 --> 01:37:54.595
basically have not been addressed and will be in these

1792
01:37:54.595 --> 01:37:57.776
court cases. So again, I'm just going to throw that out

1793
01:37:57.813 --> 01:38:00.393
there that we're rushing into this very quickly. I think we

1794
01:38:00.393 --> 01:38:02.433
should actually look at what's going on at the federal

1795
01:38:02.433 --> 01:38:05.823
level. Maybe the state just wants us to do this anyways and

1796
01:38:05.823 --> 01:38:08.253
that we'll redo it when they end up changing it. But I just

1797
01:38:08.253 --> 01:38:10.653
want to put that out there. I have plenty of comments, the

1798
01:38:10.653 --> 01:38:13.773
document happy to meet separately to review them. But I

1799
01:38:13.773 --> 01:38:15.123
just want us to be aware of the

1800
01:38:15.123 --> 01:38:17.949
Fact that we're rushing into this very quickly before we've

1801
01:38:17.949 --> 01:38:20.763
actually seen the outcome of some of these cases. Thank

1802
01:38:20.763 --> 01:38:21.033
you.

1803
01:38:21.033 --> 01:38:24.603
Thank you for sharing your concerns. Can I understand by

1804
01:38:24.603 --> 01:38:29.873
the word used? Absorb are you um raising an issue with

1805
01:38:29.873 --> 01:38:33.158
potentially approving these policies at this time? So

1806
01:38:33.158 --> 01:38:35.693
before we even go there,

1807
01:38:35.693 --> 01:38:40.183
Does the board concur that you want us to slow down, or is

1808
01:38:40.183 --> 01:38:42.613
the board, okay? With us bringing forward the second

1809
01:38:42.613 --> 01:38:45.613
reading, uh, at the next board meeting. I was going to, I

1810
01:38:45.613 --> 01:38:48.289
was going to comment that say each time there's a new

1811
01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:51.028
presidential Administration. There are updates to Title 9,

1812
01:38:51.028 --> 01:38:54.013
it was each department of Ed does updates, it it gets

1813
01:38:54.013 --> 01:38:56.893
updated every time. So I think we're always going to be

1814
01:38:56.893 --> 01:38:58.693
doing updates. I think

1815
01:38:58.693 --> 01:39:01.087
We're on Ninth circuit. I don't think there's anything

1816
01:39:01.087 --> 01:39:04.033
going on with ninth circuit on there and I think that we

1817
01:39:04.033 --> 01:39:07.033
need to be following federal guidelines as they are

1818
01:39:07.033 --> 01:39:10.775
currently re and I personally think we need to move forward

1819
01:39:10.775 --> 01:39:12.222
with these. I don't know.

1820
01:39:12.223 --> 01:39:15.390
where everyone else feels I, I think we need to be moving

1821
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:19.332
forward, so that we are compliant with current federal

1822
01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:20.833
regulations as

1823
01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:24.663
presented to us by the state and the federal government.

1824
01:39:27.863 --> 01:39:32.823
Uh, do we put ourselves at risk, if we slow down and

1825
01:39:32.823 --> 01:39:35.763
proceed cautiously and waiting for something that might

1826
01:39:35.763 --> 01:39:39.183
take years months for Supreme Court to decide,

1827
01:39:39.814 --> 01:39:44.426
I think that's a very good question. Um I do think it's very

1828
01:39:44.426 --> 01:39:47.354
important for us to approve the policies. Um and the

1829
01:39:47.354 --> 01:39:49.904
absence of having the policies updated were operating in

1830
01:39:49.904 --> 01:39:54.014
the dark, we do have law and procedure that we have to

1831
01:39:54.014 --> 01:39:56.654
follow. We currently do have Title 9 cases that were

1832
01:39:56.654 --> 01:39:59.534
investigating. Um, and I'm very much looking forward. I

1833
01:39:59.534 --> 01:40:02.174
think both Marco and I to having the policies adopted so

1834
01:40:02.174 --> 01:40:06.014
that we can enact those policies and procedures. Um,

1835
01:40:06.014 --> 01:40:08.390
additionally, I think it's very important to note that with

1836
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:11.114
the 2020 policies that came down. There were a lot of

1837
01:40:11.114 --> 01:40:14.444
concerns about those policies as as you stated trustee

1838
01:40:14.444 --> 01:40:17.114
Blackman. Um, similarly those policies have been up for

1839
01:40:17.114 --> 01:40:20.894
debate for almost 4 years. Um and then updates have come

1840
01:40:20.894 --> 01:40:23.444
and naturally, I think it's important for you all to know

1841
01:40:23.444 --> 01:40:26.342
that with any updates and changes that come, we will update

1842
01:40:26.342 --> 01:40:29.924
the policies promptly to reflect new legal guidelines.

1843
01:40:32.924 --> 01:40:37.224
Um, yeah, I hear your concerns but this is a current

1844
01:40:37.224 --> 01:40:39.077
federal law and I think we need to be following current

1845
01:40:39.077 --> 01:40:42.083
federal law. So I'm aligned with proceeding to Second

1846
01:40:42.084 --> 01:40:42.834
reading.

1847
01:40:46.324 --> 01:40:48.614
trustee quote, you have

1848
01:40:48.614 --> 01:40:51.884
Are you what do you like us to move forward?

1849
01:40:52.624 --> 01:40:56.714
So I think at this point, we have 3 3 to move forward. So

1850
01:40:56.714 --> 01:40:59.984
yes, we do want to proceed to a second reading. Um, if

1851
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.215
there's any specific feedback, um, I felt like it was

1852
01:41:03.215 --> 01:41:06.043
pretty straightforward and what what I've been reading

1853
01:41:06.044 --> 01:41:09.464
along um with everything so I didn't have anything specific

1854
01:41:09.464 --> 01:41:10.454
but

1855
01:41:10.454 --> 01:41:11.624
um,

1856
01:41:11.624 --> 01:41:14.684
if anyone does please, please share that before the next

1857
01:41:14.684 --> 01:41:17.534
meeting, so we can kind of address that.

1858
01:41:17.894 --> 01:41:22.104
Whatever, but I think um, the consensus is to move forward.

1859
01:41:22.104 --> 01:41:23.504
Thank you.

1860
01:41:23.754 --> 01:41:25.594
More questions.

1861
01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:33.104
That brings us to consent.

1862
01:41:33.324 --> 01:41:38.404
Um, that would be h. I n j.

1863
01:41:38.404 --> 01:41:41.534
Tonight, is there anything anyone would like to pull from?

1864
01:41:42.324 --> 01:41:44.104
Trustee Blackman.

1865
01:41:44.424 --> 01:41:47.374
Um, J2 I just have a question.

1866
01:41:51.264 --> 01:41:53.944
Otherwise I'll take a motion to approve the rest of them.

1867
01:41:53.944 --> 01:41:56.784
I'll make a motion that we approve the consent calendar, h.

1868
01:41:56.784 --> 01:41:59.224
I and J minus J2

1869
01:41:59.594 --> 01:42:01.224
I'll second.

1870
01:42:02.254 --> 01:42:06.824
Um, trustee pisani. Hi, everyone else. Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

1871
01:42:06.824 --> 01:42:12.594
All righty J2 is a second reading on um working remotely.

1872
01:42:13.108 --> 01:42:16.328
The reason why I want to pull it is really just to address.

1873
01:42:16.328 --> 01:42:19.208
Um, I thought it was brought up before when we were

1874
01:42:19.208 --> 01:42:23.408
reviewing this but this mostly touches on things like when

1875
01:42:23.408 --> 01:42:26.618
there's a pandemic or something really large like

1876
01:42:26.618 --> 01:42:30.530
Facilities. Get shut down, fires, whatever it is. The 1

1877
01:42:30.531 --> 01:42:33.418
thing, I thought we had brought up with the that discussion

1878
01:42:33.418 --> 01:42:37.882
discussion, was though, the ability to work remotely due to

1879
01:42:38.158 --> 01:42:41.478
of medical need or necessity. And I thought that was going

1880
01:42:41.478 --> 01:42:44.068
was going to be incorporated into this. I didn't see it.

1881
01:42:44.068 --> 01:42:46.840
Um, from the point of view, like a, whether it's Ada,

1882
01:42:46.841 --> 01:42:49.123
whether it's a medical issue, you're perfectly capable of

1883
01:42:49.123 --> 01:42:52.138
doing the work, you just can't physically come into the

1884
01:42:52.138 --> 01:42:55.438
office. So, is there something that we can roll into it?

1885
01:42:55.438 --> 01:42:57.898
That makes that accommodation, or is this? Policy is

1886
01:42:57.898 --> 01:43:01.298
strictly for like large, massive, like emergencies, where

1887
01:43:01.298 --> 01:43:02.878
we have to shut down schools

1888
01:43:03.478 --> 01:43:08.138
Or there's a remote work plan request in there, right?

1889
01:43:08.798 --> 01:43:12.598
Yes I I didn't sorry I didn't see it. That allowed for

1890
01:43:12.598 --> 01:43:16.698
things like individual or personal based on health. Some

1891
01:43:16.698 --> 01:43:19.278
healthy might be a month-long, something like that. I

1892
01:43:19.278 --> 01:43:21.418
didn't see any accommodation. It sounded like it was based

1893
01:43:21.418 --> 01:43:24.108
on some sort of big massive emergency need.

1894
01:43:24.108 --> 01:43:28.038
It could be taken care of a loved 1. It could be, um, a

1895
01:43:28.038 --> 01:43:31.068
personal your personal health, that where you can still do,

1896
01:43:31.068 --> 01:43:34.818
the work from home. Um, that's why you submit the plan and

1897
01:43:34.818 --> 01:43:38.358
the request, if I can point you to, um, a paragraph in the

1898
01:43:38.358 --> 01:43:43.698
policy. Um, for example, in the 41 4113.5, um, fourth

1899
01:43:43.698 --> 01:43:47.478
paragraph, uh, excuse me for the paragraph. Yeah. Unless

1900
01:43:47.478 --> 01:43:50.358
otherwise approved in advance, and then it goes on to

1901
01:43:50.358 --> 01:43:53.118
explain that you shall notify your supervisor. Um, if

1902
01:43:53.118 --> 01:43:55.714
you're unable to do your work assignments, due to, you

1903
01:43:55.715 --> 01:43:59.118
know, unforeseen circumstances illness, things like that.

1904
01:43:59.118 --> 01:44:02.178
So it does. And that doesn't specifically say that you'll

1905
01:44:02.178 --> 01:44:05.568
have the, the remote request approved because of illness.

1906
01:44:05.568 --> 01:44:09.918
But, um, we regularly receive remote work plan requests.

1907
01:44:10.178 --> 01:44:12.318
it either comes from the employee or it comes from the

1908
01:44:12.348 --> 01:44:16.158
supervisor who's already talked to the employee, um, and we

1909
01:44:16.278 --> 01:44:19.200
have, uh, some procedures that we've given to our managers

1910
01:44:19.201 --> 01:44:23.682
around their, um, flexibility and autonomy for approving.

1911
01:44:23.682 --> 01:44:24.228
Very, very short.

1912
01:44:24.228 --> 01:44:27.148
term remote work and then the plan when the plan needs to

1913
01:44:27.148 --> 01:44:30.448
come into play because it's for a longer term need

1914
01:44:30.448 --> 01:44:33.868
And I think that we are pretty flexible around considering

1915
01:44:33.868 --> 01:44:36.858
those as long as they're essential duties, can be completed

1916
01:44:36.858 --> 01:44:37.728
at home.

1917
01:44:37.728 --> 01:44:40.008
Okay, thank you very much for the clarification.

1918
01:44:40.668 --> 01:44:44.368
All right, if there's any no questions, and I'll take a

1919
01:44:44.368 --> 01:44:45.988
motion to approve this.

1920
01:44:46.049 --> 01:44:50.349
I'll make a motion that we approve item J2 1, second.

1921
01:44:50.439 --> 01:44:54.514
All righty trustee Vonnie I everyone else. Hi hi, hi

1922
01:44:54.514 --> 01:44:58.999
Carrie's unanimously. Um there are no written reports

1923
01:44:58.999 --> 01:44:59.869
tonight

1924
01:44:59.869 --> 01:45:04.099
Um and then anything on future items?

1925
01:45:08.169 --> 01:45:12.229
No, I certainly will add 2 items that will be coming to the

1926
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:17.314
board in the near future. Uh, the first is pertaining to

1927
01:45:17.314 --> 01:45:22.609
our continued negotiation with the city of Dublin on, uh,

1928
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:26.842
securing a softball baseball field for Emerald, uh, but at

1929
01:45:26.843 --> 01:45:30.289
the and that's progressing fairly nicely. But at the same

1930
01:45:30.289 --> 01:45:35.065
time, we are, uh, putting together plans for potentially,

1931
01:45:35.065 --> 01:45:38.629
um, upgrading the softball and baseball fields at Dublin

1932
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:42.469
High, which would include lights. Uh, so that if we do not

1933
01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:45.760
have the, uh, contract in place, the agreement in place

1934
01:45:45.761 --> 01:45:49.459
with the Sea of Dublin, we will be able to stack practices

1935
01:45:49.459 --> 01:45:53.089
and games. Uh, so that will be coming either at the second

1936
01:45:53.089 --> 01:45:56.609
board meeting in september or the 1st in October as well

1937
01:45:56.629 --> 01:46:01.334
as. Uh, Dublin High School is the last, uh, School in the

1938
01:46:01.335 --> 01:46:04.999
district that does not have uh, security fencing.

1939
01:46:04.999 --> 01:46:09.357
Decorative security fencing around. Uh, we are going out to

1940
01:46:09.357 --> 01:46:13.479
bid for that and we'll be bringing back for the boards. Um,

1941
01:46:13.479 --> 01:46:18.379
discussion on uh, installing decorative security fencing

1942
01:46:18.409 --> 01:46:22.297
around, uh, the entire campus and hopefully that will come

1943
01:46:22.297 --> 01:46:26.089
uh, in the next 1 or 2 board meetings. So, I just wanted to

1944
01:46:26.089 --> 01:46:29.359
to prep the board and the community on those 2 topics.

1945
01:46:30.179 --> 01:46:33.399
Thank, thank you for that. Uh, trustee Blackman.

1946
01:46:33.399 --> 01:46:36.534
So it I had a brief question. I don't know if it's a total

1947
01:46:36.534 --> 01:46:39.639
presentation, but the use of materials that we fund, I

1948
01:46:39.639 --> 01:46:43.269
notice in our doc, uh, presentation earlier with regards to

1949
01:46:43.269 --> 01:46:46.464
our budget, we discussed funds that we received for

1950
01:46:46.464 --> 01:46:49.209
purchase of materials and supplies. Do we have any

1951
01:46:49.209 --> 01:46:52.149
limitations on the use of those materials that we place on

1952
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:54.969
staff? Is there any way to understand? What limitations

1953
01:46:54.969 --> 01:46:57.627
might be? Like, if we provide you with a computer, I

1954
01:46:57.627 --> 01:46:59.769
understand students aren't allowed to use certain programs.

1955
01:46:59.769 --> 01:47:02.349
If we provide you with a textbook, you're only allowed to

1956
01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:04.761
look at these 3 chapters are there any? I'm hearing that

1957
01:47:04.761 --> 01:47:07.449
there's limitations being put on staff and I just want to

1958
01:47:07.449 --> 01:47:11.949
understand, do we? If we have limitations on how 1 uses the

1959
01:47:11.949 --> 01:47:14.373
materials we Supply in the classroom, have we ever

1960
01:47:14.373 --> 01:47:17.169
presented that? Or do we just have anybody can use any

1961
01:47:17.169 --> 01:47:19.299
material any? Which way to

1962
01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:22.660
Cover, the curriculum. We've asked the teachers to cover.

1963
01:47:25.411 --> 01:47:29.051
So that's the future topic. We can address it right now.

1964
01:47:29.051 --> 01:47:30.611
That's why I asked is if you could though

1965
01:47:32.921 --> 01:47:34.971
Anything else?

1966
01:47:35.061 --> 01:47:37.541
Um, I don't think there's any changes to the governance

1967
01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:38.641
calendar.

1968
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:42.321
I saw, um, trustee reports trustee spec.

1969
01:47:42.321 --> 01:47:46.621
Um, I just have 1 item. Um, I was able to, um, go to both

1970
01:47:46.621 --> 01:47:50.071
Dublin High and emerald during the school day and, um,

1971
01:47:50.071 --> 01:47:53.631
I appreciate both Francis Marine, hosting me, um, answering

1972
01:47:53.631 --> 01:47:56.631
all my questions. It was great to actually see students at

1973
01:47:56.631 --> 01:48:00.231
Emerald. I've visited the school number of times, um, as it

1974
01:48:00.231 --> 01:48:02.737
was being built, but, um, had yet to actually see it with

1975
01:48:02.737 --> 01:48:05.210
students. So it was great to see, um, some of the

1976
01:48:05.211 --> 01:48:07.691
classrooms and some of the great learning happening there

1977
01:48:07.691 --> 01:48:12.651
and, um, experience a lunch, um, day there. Um, and of

1978
01:48:12.651 --> 01:48:16.071
course, always great to see Dublin High and to see the, um,

1979
01:48:16.071 --> 01:48:19.744
the red reduced students and, um, some of the reduced

1980
01:48:19.744 --> 01:48:23.030
pressure that that school is now, um, experiencing, that's

1981
01:48:23.031 --> 01:48:23.691
all I have.

1982
01:48:24.121 --> 01:48:27.281
Should I see black 1? Nothing to report. Thank you, just

1983
01:48:27.281 --> 01:48:27.821
equal.

1984
01:48:28.231 --> 01:48:30.161
Oh, nothing to report.

1985
01:48:30.161 --> 01:48:32.491
I have nothing to report either. All my meetings are coming

1987

01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:44.431

1991
01:48:48.351 --> 01:48:52.221
Thank you for everyone making it, sorry. We were running a

1992
01:48:52.221 --> 01:48:54.741
couple minutes late to the public, but we just, you know
