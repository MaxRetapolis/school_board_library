Subject : 2. Ethnic Studies 1 Course Outline
Meeting : Oct 8, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Discussion, Information
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
In October of 2021, Governor Newsom signed a bill requiring a one-semester Ethnic Studies course for all 
California high school graduates, beginning with the class of 2030. The DUSD Governing Board approved a 
recommendation by the DUSD Curriculum Council in 2022 to implement a one-semester Ethnic Studies 
course as a graduation requirement beginning with the graduating class of 2027. The Board subsequently 
delayed the effective date to the graduating class of 2028 at the request of the staff to ensure that students 
and families received proper notification and an opportunity to incorporate the new graduation requirement 
into their four-year high school plans. 
During the 2022-23 school year, a team of district teachers developed an initial course outline for the one-
semester Ethnic Studies course that will become a graduation requirement. The course is aligned with the 
California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and is also designed to reflect the ethnic and cultural diversity of 
the Dublin community. In addition, the specific learning targets for the course are based on Ethnic Studies 
programs at San Francicso State University and Santa Clara University and are designed to prepare students 
for college-level Ethnic Studies courses. The course was piloted during the 2023-24 school year, and revisions 
have been made to the course outline based on teacher experience and student feedback.
California Education Code 51225.3 requires that a locally developed Ethnic Studies course "be presented at a 
public meeting of the governing board of the school district or the governing body of the charter school, and 
shall not be approved until a subsequent public meeting of the governing board or governing body at which 
the public has had the opportunity to express its views on the proposed course." The purpose of this agenda 
item is to present the DUSD Ethnic Studies 1-course outline during a public meeting. The staff intends to bring 
the course outline back to the Board for approval at the October 22, 2024, regular meeting.

Subject : 3. Budget Reduction Update #1
Meeting : Oct 8, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of 
Trustees
Type : Discussion, Presentation
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
At the June 11, 2024 Board meeting, staff provided a resolution for the multi-year budget to reduce expenses 
in 2025/26 and beyond by $5,500,00. The Board approved that resolution by a vote of 4-1. The staff has 
included the previous agenda item's background memo below (in italics) and attached the approved 
resolution. Tonight's presentation is the presentation shared at three community meetings and with Cabinet. 
Staff have identified $11.5 million in proposed budget cuts for the Board to consider in order to identify the 
$5.5 million in reduced spending required to meet and maintain the district's minimum reserve balance and to 
bring forward a balanced budget for adoption in June 2025.
Since fiscal year 2022, the District has run a deficit in the unrestricted general fund budget and is expected to 
finish the 2023-24 fiscal year with a deficit of nearly five million dollars. The projected budget for 2024-25 
includes additional deficit spending of $(6,202,726), at which point the districts budget reserves will be 
approaching the statutory minimum of 3% of expenditures. Any deficit spending past that point will result in the 
district falling short of that statutory minimum and facing a scenario of fiscal takeover by the county office of 
education.
In order to avoid such a scenario, staff is requesting that the board make a formal commitment in the form of 
the attached resolution to reduce expenses in 2025-26 and beyond by $5,500,000, a number which will allow 
the district to maintain its minimum reserve balance and avoid a fiscal crisis. Staff will spend the 2024-25 year 
working with the Board, our community and staff, and other stakeholders to ensure that we are able to bring a 
balanced budget for adoption in June 2025.

of 2024. Proposition 2would provide $8.5 billion to K-12 schools and $1.5 billion to community colleges to 
renovate, fix and construct facilities. The money would be distributed through matching grants, with the state 
paying a greater share of costs for less affluent districts and those with higher numbers of English learners 
and foster youth. Some of the money would be set aside for removing lead from water, creating transitional 
kindergarten classrooms and building career and technical education facilities.

Subject : 4. Second Reading and Adoption - Revision of Board 
Bylaw (BB) 9323.2, Actions by the Board, and 
accompanying Exhibit; Approval of Bylaw
Meeting : Oct 8, 2024 - Regular Meeting of the Board of Trustees
Type : Action (Consent)
Public Content
BACKGROUND:
CSBA's recommended policy language has been updated to add that the Governing Board may take action on 
a request by a Board member to participate by teleconference due to emergency circumstances if it is not on 
the posted agenda so long as there was not sufficient time to place it on the agenda. Additionally, the update 
removes language related to the authority of the district attorney's office or an interested person to file a civil 
action asking the court to order the Board to stop or prevent a Brown Act violation and replace it with language 
requiring the district attorney's office or interested person to first present a demand to "cure and correct" the 
alleged violation and, when such occurs, for the Board to consult with legal counsel on if and how to respond.
The accompanying exhibit is being updated to clarify that the exhibit is a non-exhaustive list of actions that 
require more than a simple majority vote and that have restrictions on when the Governing Board may act. In 
addition, sections have been added on "Actions Required to Occur During a Regular Board Meeting" and 
"Prohibitions on Certain Board Actions." The exhibit has also been updated to reflect new law (SB 494, 2023) 
which prohibits the Board from taking action to terminate a superintendent or assistant superintendent without 
cause within 30 calendar days after the first convening of the Board after a general election at which one or 
more of the Board members are elected or recalled, and new law (SB 229, 2023) which requires a district that 
is disposing of surplus land and has received notification of a violation to hold an open and public meeting to 
review and consider the substance of the notice of violation and prohibits the Board from taking final action to 
ratify or approve the proposed disposal of surplus land until a public meeting is held. The exhibit has also 
been updated for clarity, precision, organization, and consistency.
The Board conducted a first reading of this revised policy and accompanying exhibit at its September 24, 2024 
meeting; it now presented for a second reading and adoption. The exhibit, with recommended revisions, is 
included for information only, and will not require board approval.
