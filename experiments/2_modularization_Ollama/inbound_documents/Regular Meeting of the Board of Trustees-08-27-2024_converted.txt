BACKGROUND:
At its July 2, 2024 Special Board Meeting, the Board took action to adjust the district's contribution toward the

for those Dublin residents who have filed their candidacy for a seat on the pursuant to Elections Code 13307

candidate.
Staff prepared a draft of a revised Board Bylaw 9220 reflecting this change, along with additional updates as 
recommended by CSBA. The draft of the revised bylaw was presented and discussed at the August 13, 2024 
board meeting, and input was provided to staff on refinements to the language. In preparing the revised draft 
for board approval, for the sake of clarity, staff has assumed acceptance of the previously presented changes,

CSBA recently issued updated policy language for Bylaw 9223, Filling Vacancies, to reflect new law (AB 1326, 
2023), which requires that the notice of a provisional appointment be posted on the district's website. 
Additionally, the bylaw language has been updated to (1) focus on filling a vacancy by appointment rather than 
special election, (2) enable the Governing Board to approve, by resolution, the procedures for selecting the 
person to be provisionally appointed to fill the vacancy, and (3) explain how long an appointed Board member 
may serve. In addition, the bylaw has been updated for clarity, precision, organization, and consistency.
At the August 13, 2024 board meeting, staff presented a draft of the revised bylaw reflecting these changes, 
and input was provided to staff on refinements to the language. In preparing the revised draft for board 
approval, for the sake of clarity, staff has assumed acceptance of the previously presented changes, and
