00:42:51.645 --> 00:42:53.955
Three of our GAILs were named Coca-Cola Scholar

182
00:42:54.055 --> 00:42:58.395
Semi-finalists, which is pretty impressive since only 1.45%

183
00:42:58.415 --> 00:42:59.675
of applicants are selected.

184
00:43:00.775 --> 00:43:02.115
And last Thursday, our chamber

185
00:43:02.135 --> 00:43:05.595
and concert cos performed at the Fall Orchestra

186
00:43:05.595 --> 00:43:07.715
and Jazz concert, and it went really well.

187
00:43:09.445 --> 00:43:11.725
I recently met with Valley High's Leadership

188
00:43:11.785 --> 00:43:14.405
and introduced them to some ideas for resolutions,

189
00:43:14.465 --> 00:43:15.885
and also just introduced them to

190
00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:16.965
what it is and how it works.

191
00:43:17.725 --> 00:43:19.085
I got to know their class and I,

192
00:43:19.225 --> 00:43:20.765
and that helps me summarize everything.

193
00:43:20.785 --> 00:43:22.285
And many were interested in joining our

194
00:43:22.285 --> 00:43:23.405
student run committee groups.

195
00:43:24.315 --> 00:43:26.965
Last Friday, I met with Joy Young, our mental health

196
00:43:26.965 --> 00:43:28.005
and wellness coordinator

197
00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:30.365
to discuss a mental wellness resolution

198
00:43:30.465 --> 00:43:32.165
and some curriculum strategies.

199
00:43:32.745 --> 00:43:34.365
I'm excited to meet all of our counselors.

200
00:43:34.425 --> 00:43:37.085
And on Friday I plan to visit Murray to meet

201
00:43:37.085 --> 00:43:39.125
with their counselor and also see DHS students

202
00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:40.285
mentoring third graders.

203
00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:42.725
Last Thursday we had a budget committee meeting,

204
00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:44.885
which went really well, and there's a lot

205
00:43:44.885 --> 00:43:46.365
of community input going into our fi

206
00:43:46.365 --> 00:43:47.805
financial decisions this year.

207
00:43:48.305 --> 00:43:49.805
And this leads and the leads

208
00:43:49.805 --> 00:43:51.885
for the resolution committee groups, which are students

209
00:43:51.905 --> 00:43:53.765
who applied, will be announced later this week.

210
00:43:54.495 --> 00:43:55.495
Thank you.

211
00:43:57.375 --> 00:43:59.075
All right. Thank you. Um, DTA

212
00:44:10.435 --> 00:44:11.795
Distinguished members of the Dublin Unified

213
00:44:11.795 --> 00:44:13.155
School District Board of Trustees.

214
00:44:13.305 --> 00:44:15.235
It's once again, my pleasure to come

215
00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:17.875
before you as the representative of the, of the devoted,

216
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.355
hardworking, and passionate members

217
00:44:19.495 --> 00:44:21.115
of the Dublin Teachers Association,

218
00:44:21.615 --> 00:44:23.555
it has been immensely gratify, gratifying

219
00:44:23.555 --> 00:44:25.435
to work alongside you and begin building a stronger

220
00:44:25.435 --> 00:44:26.795
connection that will benefit our students.

221
00:44:27.355 --> 00:44:29.235
I would like to take a moment to thank Trustee Spec

222
00:44:29.235 --> 00:44:31.605
and Trustee Pellum for leading this effort

223
00:44:31.605 --> 00:44:33.605
to strengthen our bonds as an education community.

224
00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:35.765
Throughout September and October,

225
00:44:35.825 --> 00:44:38.285
our district leadership has held town hall meetings

226
00:44:38.285 --> 00:44:39.925
and conducted surveys to gather feedback

227
00:44:39.925 --> 00:44:41.005
regarding the district's budget

228
00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:42.565
that was prepared by management.

229
00:44:43.065 --> 00:44:44.485
At our recent budget committee meeting,

230
00:44:44.485 --> 00:44:46.725
trustee Blackman noted that these conversations had not

231
00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:49.125
yet included any discussion of plans to increase revenue.

232
00:44:49.925 --> 00:44:51.365
I want to acknowledge and appreciate

233
00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:52.685
that fresh and essential perspective.

234
00:44:54.205 --> 00:44:56.305
We all know that budget productions are estimates,

235
00:44:56.305 --> 00:44:59.145
not facts only the budget actuals or actual revenues

236
00:44:59.145 --> 00:45:00.265
and expenditures are the facts.

237
00:45:00.325 --> 00:45:02.705
And that's why Dublin Teachers Association Leadership

238
00:45:02.705 --> 00:45:04.785
studies those budget facts as we analyze how

239
00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:05.945
to achieve the best for our students within

240
00:45:05.945 --> 00:45:07.345
those same budget facts.

241
00:45:08.665 --> 00:45:10.985
Last week, Mr. Hobbs, assistant Superintendent

242
00:45:10.985 --> 00:45:13.185
of business services shared data with both DTA

243
00:45:13.185 --> 00:45:15.705
and CSEA leadership regarding the estimation

244
00:45:15.705 --> 00:45:16.865
of average daily attendance

245
00:45:17.045 --> 00:45:19.345
or a DA, which affects the largest source

246
00:45:19.345 --> 00:45:21.265
of revenue our district receives each year

247
00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:23.185
and its impact on the district's budget.

248
00:45:23.565 --> 00:45:26.065
We would like to thank Mr. Hobbs for his collaboration.

249
00:45:26.655 --> 00:45:29.025
This data supported DTA leadership's assertions

250
00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:32.185
that a DA estimates which affect revenue projections need

251
00:45:32.185 --> 00:45:35.665
to be very closely ref, um, reflective of our actual a DA.

252
00:45:36.145 --> 00:45:38.505
Bringing these projected and actual numbers closer allows

253
00:45:38.525 --> 00:45:40.025
you our board of trustees

254
00:45:40.365 --> 00:45:42.905
to make the most informed budget decisions possible based on

255
00:45:42.905 --> 00:45:44.425
the most accurate data possible.

256
00:45:46.105 --> 00:45:48.005
One element of the data that stood out to us,

257
00:45:48.005 --> 00:45:50.525
however, was the marked difference in a DA over the course

258
00:45:50.525 --> 00:45:53.565
of the eight years of data provided in the pre covid era.

259
00:45:53.705 --> 00:45:57.765
Our a DA as a percentage of daily attendance was 97.8%.

260
00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.525
That percentage has dropped

261
00:45:59.785 --> 00:46:02.085
to a budgeted projection based on a DA estimate

262
00:46:02.085 --> 00:46:05.885
of 95.77% in the intervening years.

263
00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:09.285
That 2.03% may sound like a small amount,

264
00:46:10.105 --> 00:46:12.325
but in concrete terms, that is hundreds

265
00:46:12.325 --> 00:46:14.445
of students missing out on the opportunities our schools

266
00:46:14.445 --> 00:46:17.125
provide them, resulting in millions of dollars of revenue

267
00:46:17.395 --> 00:46:18.845
that could be benefiting all students.

268
00:46:19.385 --> 00:46:21.645
In other words, those absences translate to millions

269
00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:23.005
of dollars in revenue loss

270
00:46:23.085 --> 00:46:24.325
that could be supporting our students.

271
00:46:25.405 --> 00:46:28.285
Circling back to Trustee Blackman's, insight, DTA leaders

272
00:46:28.305 --> 00:46:30.405
and members Urge Management to create

273
00:46:30.425 --> 00:46:33.085
and implement a plan to increase our A DA percentage,

274
00:46:33.225 --> 00:46:34.405
our students deserve that.

275
00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:35.855
Thank you.

276
00:46:37.455 --> 00:46:41.835
Thank you. CSCA? No. Okay.

277
00:46:41.835 --> 00:46:44.635
No comment from CSCA today. I do see them here today.

278
00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.275
Um, we don't have anything on special order of business.

279
00:46:48.455 --> 00:46:49.595
Um, so that will take us

280
00:46:49.655 --> 00:46:51.595
to our general public comment period.

281
00:46:52.455 --> 00:46:54.275
Um, if you have, if you're online

282
00:46:54.275 --> 00:46:56.115
and want to log in at this point, please do so.

283
00:46:56.175 --> 00:46:58.515
Do we have any, we don't have any speaker

284
00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.795
cards and no one online.

285
00:47:00.865 --> 00:47:02.515
I'll give them another minute or so.

286
00:47:03.515 --> 00:47:06.285
This is your item to talk about. Anything.

287
00:47:08.045 --> 00:47:08.985
Has anyone hopped on?

288
00:47:12.785 --> 00:47:14.115
Okay, then I'm gonna keep going

289
00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:17.195
and we're gonna go on to some board policies.

290
00:47:17.805 --> 00:47:19.395
First one is an update

291
00:47:19.495 --> 00:47:23.105
on accountability.

292
00:47:26.025 --> 00:47:28.365
Yes. This first, uh, policy that we bring

293
00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:32.485
before you tonight is board policy zero 500 accountability.

294
00:47:32.795 --> 00:47:37.085
This reflects the new SB 1 14 20 23 law.

295
00:47:37.665 --> 00:47:39.925
Uh, most of this is tied

296
00:47:39.925 --> 00:47:42.485
to the state accountability system through the state testing.

297
00:47:43.145 --> 00:47:45.725
Uh, this specific change is, uh,

298
00:47:45.725 --> 00:47:48.405
adding long-term English learners, uh,

299
00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:52.885
and their new definition, uh, to the, um, uh,

300
00:47:52.885 --> 00:47:54.285
board policy, uh,

301
00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:56.925
and the new basis for technical assistance.

302
00:47:56.945 --> 00:47:59.365
So when, uh, school districts, uh,

303
00:47:59.555 --> 00:48:02.525
subgroups do not perform consistently two years in a row,

304
00:48:03.035 --> 00:48:07.605
they then are eligible for technical assistance.

305
00:48:07.605 --> 00:48:11.165
And technical assistance is a list of providers

306
00:48:11.165 --> 00:48:13.685
that the State Board of Education provides, uh,

307
00:48:13.745 --> 00:48:16.125
or the Department of Education approves.

308
00:48:16.505 --> 00:48:20.685
Uh, and, uh, if you're not making progress, then you need

309
00:48:20.685 --> 00:48:21.805
to partner with that vendor.

310
00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:23.205
This doesn't apply to us

311
00:48:23.205 --> 00:48:25.565
because we're not a technical assistance when

312
00:48:25.565 --> 00:48:26.605
it comes to the state testing.

313
00:48:27.145 --> 00:48:30.765
Um, but it is something that all school districts are part

314
00:48:30.785 --> 00:48:34.165
of if their testing dips below a certain level.

315
00:48:34.585 --> 00:48:38.925
Uh, so all these changes are tied to changes in ED code

316
00:48:39.145 --> 00:48:41.885
and CSPA recommendations. First reading.

317
00:48:42.755 --> 00:48:46.765
Yeah, there was some blasts from the past of a YP and API

318
00:48:46.785 --> 00:48:50.245
and early two thousands accountability things

319
00:48:50.245 --> 00:48:53.565
that are thankfully long gone, um, and have been adjusted.

320
00:48:53.905 --> 00:48:56.005
Um, anyone have any questions

321
00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:57.725
or comment on this one? Um, trustee Blackman,

322
00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:00.365
Thank you very much for bringing this forward.

323
00:49:00.625 --> 00:49:01.645
Um, I had a question

324
00:49:01.645 --> 00:49:04.725
because in, I'm looking at the number of, paragraph number,

325
00:49:05.645 --> 00:49:07.385
the third paragraph maybe into the fourth.

326
00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:10.185
There's the mix of language

327
00:49:10.185 --> 00:49:12.345
that denotes the district in each school

328
00:49:12.995 --> 00:49:14.945
shall demonstrate comparable improvement,

329
00:49:15.145 --> 00:49:16.425
academic achievement for all of

330
00:49:16.425 --> 00:49:17.785
these students and subgroups.

331
00:49:18.425 --> 00:49:20.865
I was wondering if the language for that paragraph,

332
00:49:20.865 --> 00:49:25.145
if it's not tied to specific language in, um, ed code or

333
00:49:25.145 --> 00:49:27.465
otherwise, could be separate out

334
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:30.505
because there's one way that we look at information

335
00:49:30.765 --> 00:49:32.985
and manage it from the district point of view.

336
00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:36.505
And then separately for each school site, yes, it's overseen

337
00:49:36.505 --> 00:49:38.065
by the district, but it just seemed

338
00:49:38.065 --> 00:49:40.785
that combining the two made it seem like, um,

339
00:49:42.485 --> 00:49:44.615
that the subgroups of the students,

340
00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:47.895
if they're at individual schools, are actually, um,

341
00:49:48.145 --> 00:49:50.855
under the, somehow they're connected with the district.

342
00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:53.055
But I actually am wondering if they're two separate things.

343
00:49:53.675 --> 00:49:55.735
So again, I I'm not sure what you're referring to.

344
00:49:55.735 --> 00:49:58.615
You said a paragraph. They're all numbered. Can you tell

345
00:49:58.615 --> 00:49:59.615
Me the number? Sorry, the third paragraph

346
00:49:59.615 --> 00:50:00.495
down says,

347
00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:03.335
the district in each district school shall demonstrate

348
00:50:03.335 --> 00:50:05.255
comparable improvement in academic treatment

349
00:50:05.255 --> 00:50:07.135
for all numerically significant subgroups.

350
00:50:08.155 --> 00:50:10.255
But isn't it that each school basically in

351
00:50:10.255 --> 00:50:11.655
that information flows to the district?

352
00:50:13.975 --> 00:50:16.315
I'm just curious, like are we putting them all under one

353
00:50:16.475 --> 00:50:18.315
umbrella or there are two separate statements here?

354
00:50:20.225 --> 00:50:22.795
Well, it would help if I open up the right one.

355
00:50:24.065 --> 00:50:25.805
So let me get there. I'm, I apologize.

356
00:50:26.045 --> 00:50:28.085
I was, I had the second one open, uh,

357
00:50:28.095 --> 00:50:29.405
third paragraph district and,

358
00:50:29.705 --> 00:50:31.605
And even the second paragraph, 'cause it says district

359
00:50:31.605 --> 00:50:34.085
and school performance shall be annually evaluated,

360
00:50:34.785 --> 00:50:37.405
but the school performance flows into the district review.

361
00:50:37.985 --> 00:50:40.245
But we, we get monitored on both.

362
00:50:40.245 --> 00:50:41.525
That's why they're in the SIP says

363
00:50:42.185 --> 00:50:43.185
That's correct. So there are

364
00:50:43.185 --> 00:50:46.165
certain school, if a school is underperforming,

365
00:50:46.275 --> 00:50:49.325
that school will receive technical assistance and

366
00:50:49.325 --> 00:50:51.685
therefore the district is required to be part of

367
00:50:51.685 --> 00:50:52.885
that technical assistance.

368
00:50:53.385 --> 00:50:56.725
So there, uh, we're monitored as a district as a whole as,

369
00:50:56.725 --> 00:50:58.085
you know, with the dashboard.

370
00:50:58.505 --> 00:51:00.405
And that dashboard is made up of scores

371
00:51:00.465 --> 00:51:01.725
by each of our schools.

372
00:51:02.305 --> 00:51:04.605
And so if there's a school that's underperforming,

373
00:51:04.635 --> 00:51:06.805
then the district is underperforming in that area.

374
00:51:07.485 --> 00:51:09.165
I I was just trying to figure out if there's a way

375
00:51:09.165 --> 00:51:10.725
to nuance the language, because it would seem

376
00:51:10.725 --> 00:51:12.565
that if it was just the school that basically hit

377
00:51:12.565 --> 00:51:14.165
that threshold, that that's

378
00:51:14.165 --> 00:51:16.005
where the targeted effort would be.

379
00:51:16.465 --> 00:51:18.925
It seems like it puts the whole district under the sort

380
00:51:18.925 --> 00:51:20.365
of guys, but it's really just that school.

381
00:51:20.365 --> 00:51:25.015
Correct. Okay. That's the only thing. And then the,

382
00:51:25.195 --> 00:51:26.735
It, it depends on whether

383
00:51:26.735 --> 00:51:29.735
or not we met the threshold as a district as a whole,

384
00:51:29.735 --> 00:51:32.655
whether we are, uh, under the technical assistant

385
00:51:32.675 --> 00:51:35.775
or if it's just a specific school because of their score.

386
00:51:35.995 --> 00:51:39.335
It, it depends on the number of schools, uh,

387
00:51:39.335 --> 00:51:42.455
within the district that are below that the required scores.

388
00:51:42.715 --> 00:51:44.695
So there's actually an Okay. Alright.

389
00:51:44.955 --> 00:51:46.615
Um, the other question I had was

390
00:51:46.615 --> 00:51:49.015
that the three paragraphs in the middle that were, uh,

391
00:51:49.015 --> 00:51:52.015
crossed out I thought had some interesting information that

392
00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:53.375
provided specifics.

393
00:51:53.955 --> 00:51:54.975
Um, and I didn't seem

394
00:51:54.995 --> 00:51:58.015
as much specificity in the current rendition.

395
00:51:58.595 --> 00:52:02.495
So were we asked to, in the update, pull out specifics as to

396
00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:04.615
how we're actually using standardized testing

397
00:52:04.675 --> 00:52:07.255
and other things to evaluate them against certain standards?

398
00:52:07.685 --> 00:52:10.055
Like is there something that would be here

399
00:52:10.075 --> 00:52:12.695
or is it just taken out because we don't know anymore?

400
00:52:12.955 --> 00:52:14.895
Or that's for the county to decide

401
00:52:14.895 --> 00:52:16.975
or for the state to decide or for us to figure out?

402
00:52:17.755 --> 00:52:20.335
I'm just trying to figure out how do we know what's the

403
00:52:20.335 --> 00:52:22.895
evaluation metric that we're looking at

404
00:52:22.925 --> 00:52:26.015
that determines whether or not we don't meet some standard?

405
00:52:26.395 --> 00:52:28.735
Is there a test or some bar?

406
00:52:28.755 --> 00:52:30.455
We have some threshold. Is it it's

407
00:52:30.455 --> 00:52:31.455
The dashboard. The dashboard

408
00:52:31.455 --> 00:52:32.575
that's referred to.

409
00:52:32.575 --> 00:52:33.575
Because yeah, the ones that were

410
00:52:33.575 --> 00:52:34.615
taken out are no longer used.

411
00:52:34.615 --> 00:52:36.695
Those were federal guidelines

412
00:52:38.325 --> 00:52:39.975
from No Child Left Behind. And the

413
00:52:39.975 --> 00:52:41.175
Second paragraph talks about the

414
00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:42.255
California School dashboard.

415
00:52:42.255 --> 00:52:43.335
The California Accountability and

416
00:52:43.335 --> 00:52:44.375
Continuous Improvement System.

417
00:52:45.025 --> 00:52:46.855
Right. But when we talk about the school dashboard,

418
00:52:46.855 --> 00:52:48.375
there's nothing in here that describes like

419
00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:49.455
when you hit a threshold.

420
00:52:49.455 --> 00:52:51.415
Like we know when we review the dashboard,

421
00:52:51.415 --> 00:52:53.815
when we hit a threshold where we've got issues or concerns.

422
00:52:53.815 --> 00:52:54.815
But there's nothing in here that says

423
00:52:54.845 --> 00:52:55.815
it's just the dashboard.

424
00:52:57.095 --> 00:52:59.335
I think it what the threshold is changes.

425
00:52:59.515 --> 00:53:03.175
And, and it's not just a level, it's growth year to year.

426
00:53:03.455 --> 00:53:07.525
I mean it's, and I, I think the state has authority to kind

427
00:53:07.525 --> 00:53:08.525
of adjust that.

428
00:53:08.545 --> 00:53:11.005
You know, I think they add, just added something this

429
00:53:11.005 --> 00:53:12.775
year. I forget what,

430
00:53:13.365 --> 00:53:15.415
Well, if you, if you look at the language

431
00:53:15.415 --> 00:53:17.575
that's crossed out, it doesn't give you the

432
00:53:17.575 --> 00:53:18.775
targets in the language.

433
00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:21.255
It just says, what are the assessments we'll be using?

434
00:53:21.395 --> 00:53:23.855
So that's, that's what was taken out.

435
00:53:24.015 --> 00:53:26.205
'cause we're not using those. We're now using the da uh,

436
00:53:26.205 --> 00:53:28.325
the, uh, California dashboard.

437
00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:30.885
And again, we're not showing what those levels are.

438
00:53:31.085 --> 00:53:34.435
'cause those levels change year to year. Right.

439
00:53:34.495 --> 00:53:37.395
So we get reported on what those levels are each year,

440
00:53:37.395 --> 00:53:39.955
what we strive for, but it's not gonna be in the,

441
00:53:40.055 --> 00:53:42.315
in the document because it will change each year

442
00:53:42.405 --> 00:53:43.475
based on each performance.

443
00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:44.835
I understand that. I'm just sort of wondering

444
00:53:44.915 --> 00:53:46.675
'cause we're gonna go through the dashboard like the next

445
00:53:46.675 --> 00:53:48.155
meeting I presume, and see all the data

446
00:53:48.615 --> 00:53:50.555
and we know what our norm is

447
00:53:50.695 --> 00:53:51.875
and where we should be performing.

448
00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:53.435
We see little dips up and down.

449
00:53:53.815 --> 00:53:55.355
But from a state point of view, if,

450
00:53:55.455 --> 00:53:56.675
are they looking at our norm?

451
00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:58.955
Like if our norm all of a sudden dips a little bit,

452
00:53:58.955 --> 00:54:00.995
that's an issue that the state will look at?

453
00:54:01.335 --> 00:54:03.755
Or is it against the entire state of California?

454
00:54:03.895 --> 00:54:06.515
If we're still performing at a very high level, does

455
00:54:06.515 --> 00:54:07.715
that mean that we keep going

456
00:54:07.735 --> 00:54:09.315
and that the county and the state are fine?

457
00:54:09.805 --> 00:54:11.835
Which metric are we held to some state standard?

458
00:54:11.835 --> 00:54:13.395
Are we held to our own standard that we set

459
00:54:13.395 --> 00:54:15.075
for ourselves? Just curious. It's all,

460
00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:16.185
Yeah. It's, uh,

461
00:54:16.185 --> 00:54:17.955
the, the, the test that we're

462
00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.315
referencing is the ELPAC test

463
00:54:20.815 --> 00:54:22.515
and that's the annual assessment.

464
00:54:22.575 --> 00:54:24.115
We give each EL student

465
00:54:25.455 --> 00:54:27.995
and it is the, the terms are dictated

466
00:54:27.995 --> 00:54:29.835
by the state in terms of the levels.

467
00:54:29.935 --> 00:54:33.755
And so, but we get graded on how well we perform

468
00:54:34.025 --> 00:54:35.355
with our status and change.

469
00:54:35.775 --> 00:54:39.075
So we get, um, each student is assessed in terms

470
00:54:39.315 --> 00:54:41.715
of did they improve or did they not improve?

471
00:54:41.735 --> 00:54:44.875
But the, but the markers are deemed by the state.

472
00:54:45.895 --> 00:54:49.435
Thank you very much. Yeah, it would, it's both.

473
00:54:49.545 --> 00:54:53.555
It's, yeah, it's growth and just average.

474
00:54:53.615 --> 00:54:55.675
That's, that's why sometimes the colors look,

475
00:54:57.625 --> 00:54:59.555
look different, you know, time to time you like.

476
00:54:59.775 --> 00:55:02.595
It seems like you're high on one level, but it's growth.

477
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:05.675
Um, any other questions related to this one?

478
00:55:05.675 --> 00:55:08.675
This is just a first reading, correct? Yes.

479
00:55:12.325 --> 00:55:14.735
Okay. The next one is related to this one also.

480
00:55:15.635 --> 00:55:18.465
Um, new federal title one.

481
00:55:19.465 --> 00:55:22.845
So again, this is also new language, uh, that's tied to,

482
00:55:23.265 --> 00:55:26.605
uh, SB one 14, uh, in 2023.

483
00:55:26.945 --> 00:55:30.485
Uh, it is still tied to, uh, intervention

484
00:55:30.545 --> 00:55:31.765
for underperforming schools.

485
00:55:32.465 --> 00:55:35.045
Uh, and this is the one that also continues

486
00:55:35.045 --> 00:55:37.685
to have the technical support, uh,

487
00:55:37.795 --> 00:55:39.765
when a district does not meet their goals.

488
00:55:40.425 --> 00:55:43.485
Uh, and those goals are established, uh, again,

489
00:55:43.485 --> 00:55:44.485
depending on the number

490
00:55:44.485 --> 00:55:47.205
of students you have the progress made, um,

491
00:55:47.825 --> 00:55:49.805
and the overall progress of the district.

492
00:55:54.475 --> 00:55:55.755
I question Trustee Blackman.

493
00:55:56.495 --> 00:55:57.995
So I was curious, 'cause I went to the,

494
00:55:58.495 --> 00:56:01.555
the writing in ed code 5 2 0 7 1,

495
00:56:02.015 --> 00:56:04.595
and it, I think it was trustee chair brought this up at one

496
00:56:04.595 --> 00:56:06.395
point when we actually take information

497
00:56:06.395 --> 00:56:09.875
or paraphrase it into our policies, um,

498
00:56:10.295 --> 00:56:12.915
why we wouldn't just say, go and see ed code

499
00:56:13.135 --> 00:56:15.235
and leave it at that, because there's actually quite a lot

500
00:56:15.235 --> 00:56:17.075
of information and I was trying

501
00:56:17.075 --> 00:56:19.355
to coordinate apples to apples with it.

502
00:56:19.355 --> 00:56:20.715
And I was actually quite confused.

503
00:56:21.215 --> 00:56:23.765
Um, I think there's some paraphrasing of information here

504
00:56:23.765 --> 00:56:25.245
that doesn't quite capture everything

505
00:56:25.245 --> 00:56:26.445
that's in the egg code piece.

506
00:56:26.445 --> 00:56:29.455
So I was wondering if maybe when you get

507
00:56:29.455 --> 00:56:31.895
to something like this, it's quite lengthy in the actual

508
00:56:31.925 --> 00:56:33.815
code, if it might be just easier to say,

509
00:56:34.135 --> 00:56:35.135
reference the code here

510
00:56:35.155 --> 00:56:39.135
and provide like a, a link to it rather than actually trying

511
00:56:39.135 --> 00:56:41.695
to coalesce into something that's short but sweet.

512
00:56:48.135 --> 00:56:50.425
Well, uh, again, the, the code is referenced

513
00:56:50.425 --> 00:56:52.345
for individuals that want more detail

514
00:56:52.485 --> 00:56:54.305
and want to actually read the ED code.

515
00:56:54.455 --> 00:56:57.825
It's referenced there, uh, board policies are taking

516
00:56:58.765 --> 00:57:00.185
any board policy that we have.

517
00:57:00.815 --> 00:57:04.345
It's being paraphrased from the actual law of,

518
00:57:04.605 --> 00:57:05.865
um, ED code.

519
00:57:05.965 --> 00:57:09.365
So I, I get the understanding that, uh,

520
00:57:09.465 --> 00:57:10.925
it seems like it's duplication.

521
00:57:11.505 --> 00:57:15.205
Um, but this is the governance process that, um,

522
00:57:16.745 --> 00:57:17.825
CSBA has adopted

523
00:57:18.045 --> 00:57:20.985
and, um, we're following their, their process.

524
00:57:22.965 --> 00:57:23.945
So the reason I brought

525
00:57:23.945 --> 00:57:24.985
up is like, I'll give you an example.

526
00:57:24.985 --> 00:57:27.665
On the second page it says the district made its own

527
00:57:27.665 --> 00:57:30.585
expense, engage another service provider included,

528
00:57:30.605 --> 00:57:32.385
but not limited to, et cetera, et cetera.

529
00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:34.585
But actually in the document on code,

530
00:57:34.585 --> 00:57:37.545
it says the county superintendent of schools in consultation

531
00:57:37.545 --> 00:57:41.505
with the district may engage in another service provider.

532
00:57:42.565 --> 00:57:44.705
So that's why I was saying like, when we paraphrase it,

533
00:57:44.705 --> 00:57:47.505
we've actually missed the fact that some of the language

534
00:57:47.565 --> 00:57:50.065
and the actual ED code is actually referring to

535
00:57:50.715 --> 00:57:53.625
other authorities who make the decisions

536
00:57:53.625 --> 00:57:55.345
or have to work with us to make those decisions.

537
00:57:57.765 --> 00:58:01.215
It's similar when you talk about the superintendent

538
00:58:01.275 --> 00:58:02.295
or the designee.

539
00:58:02.555 --> 00:58:06.455
The county offices are the designee of the state board, uh,

540
00:58:06.455 --> 00:58:07.695
and the Department of Education.

541
00:58:08.275 --> 00:58:11.735
Uh, and so EDCO provides the county the authority

542
00:58:11.795 --> 00:58:14.575
to oversee, um, our LCAPs

543
00:58:14.795 --> 00:58:17.935
and to oversee, um, the technical support.

544
00:58:18.155 --> 00:58:21.695
And so that's why it's in consultation on if we want to hire

545
00:58:22.375 --> 00:58:25.615
a a vendor that's, uh, off that, that's not on the list.

546
00:58:29.995 --> 00:58:31.845
Okay. I just thought it would make sense

547
00:58:31.845 --> 00:58:34.125
to just include it directly from edco, but, okay.

548
00:58:38.115 --> 00:58:40.015
Any other questions? Assume there's,

549
00:58:40.295 --> 00:58:41.335
I assume there's no public comment

550
00:58:41.355 --> 00:58:42.975
and you'll, you'll let me know if there is.

551
00:58:44.435 --> 00:58:46.535
Um, and again, first reading

552
00:58:46.595 --> 00:58:48.655
and the next one is regarding waivers.

553
00:58:50.275 --> 00:58:53.965
Um, is there anything

554
00:58:54.915 --> 00:58:58.345
you wanna share on this one from the district level?

555
00:58:58.455 --> 00:59:01.065
Yeah, this is minimal changes that, uh,

556
00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:03.705
CSBA is recommending.

557
00:59:03.705 --> 00:59:06.705
There is some new language, um, on there,

558
00:59:06.885 --> 00:59:11.325
but it's the ability, the ability for a school district

559
00:59:11.325 --> 00:59:14.925
to apply for, uh, a variety of waivers.

560
00:59:15.425 --> 00:59:18.645
Um, I think the one that comes to mind the quickest here,

561
00:59:19.145 --> 00:59:24.045
uh, is just the ability for for to, uh, waive, um,

562
00:59:24.155 --> 00:59:27.605
instructional minutes, uh, when there's a, uh,

563
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:29.325
smokey day, things of that nature.

564
00:59:29.985 --> 00:59:33.485
Um, if you want to try to waive, uh,

565
00:59:33.665 --> 00:59:34.925
the accountability system

566
00:59:34.925 --> 00:59:38.445
because there are a group of, uh, school districts,

567
00:59:38.445 --> 00:59:42.605
the power, uh, five districts, Fresno LA Unified

568
00:59:43.035 --> 00:59:47.645
that are able to use, um, other, um, scoring for their,

569
00:59:48.025 --> 00:59:49.565
um, dashboard scores.

570
00:59:49.745 --> 00:59:52.045
So, um, this is just the process

571
00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:55.045
that districts follow when they would like a waiver that's

572
00:59:55.115 --> 00:59:57.645
outside of the current ed code language.

573
01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:06.615
Thank you. Any questions? Trustee Blackman?

574
01:00:07.155 --> 01:00:08.495
So I appreciate the update.

575
01:00:08.655 --> 01:00:10.735
I see that we've, um, included things

576
01:00:10.735 --> 01:00:12.135
where advisory councils

577
01:00:12.195 --> 01:00:14.175
and other groups are allowed to have some input,

578
01:00:14.475 --> 01:00:17.015
but I notice in the process that the only time that any

579
01:00:17.015 --> 01:00:18.855
of these, let's say a long term waiver

580
01:00:18.855 --> 01:00:21.935
that we are thinking about comes back to the community, is

581
01:00:21.935 --> 01:00:24.375
after all these other groups have sort of coalesced

582
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:28.215
and the district has prepared, um, a proposal that it wants

583
01:00:28.275 --> 01:00:30.695
to get the board to approve, to then move forward

584
01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:33.175
with at the state level and at the other agencies that might

585
01:00:33.925 --> 01:00:35.015
need to coordinate with.

586
01:00:35.525 --> 01:00:37.935
What I'm wondering about though is earlier on,

587
01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:40.655
is there any reason why we couldn't have more community

588
01:00:40.665 --> 01:00:41.975
input, especially if it was an,

589
01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:43.575
or just suggest if there was an item

590
01:00:43.605 --> 01:00:45.295
that actually would affect the community?

591
01:00:45.935 --> 01:00:48.895
'cause right now we're only including advisory councils

592
01:00:49.235 --> 01:00:50.655
and so we wait until after we've gone

593
01:00:50.655 --> 01:00:52.335
through this whole process to get community input.

594
01:00:52.335 --> 01:00:55.375
And I'm just wondering why we couldn't do some community

595
01:00:55.425 --> 01:00:57.615
input a little bit before to get feedback.

596
01:00:58.135 --> 01:00:59.135
I know, just a question.

597
01:00:59.295 --> 01:01:00.415
'cause obviously it's open-ended

598
01:01:00.635 --> 01:01:02.335
and some of these waivers are gonna be things that we need

599
01:01:02.335 --> 01:01:04.215
to do because we need to do them because we have to be able

600
01:01:04.215 --> 01:01:06.135
to run the business of providing education.

601
01:01:06.135 --> 01:01:07.655
But in cases where it's something else

602
01:01:07.655 --> 01:01:09.935
that has community interest, would there be the possibility

603
01:01:09.935 --> 01:01:12.575
of actually inviting the public to contribute thoughts

604
01:01:12.575 --> 01:01:14.935
earlier on rather than after the process is complete?

605
01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.015
Yeah, I think at, at that time,

606
01:01:17.075 --> 01:01:18.855
the board could easily direct staff

607
01:01:18.995 --> 01:01:21.455
to follow a certain process to get feedback

608
01:01:21.455 --> 01:01:23.815
before we actually have the board vote on it

609
01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:26.175
and then submit it to the state board of education.

610
01:01:26.335 --> 01:01:28.495
'cause they're the ultimate, uh, authority on it.

611
01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:32.755
Thank you. All right.

612
01:01:32.775 --> 01:01:35.155
So those three will come back. Um, next meeting.

613
01:01:36.495 --> 01:01:39.425
Next up is a report on early literacy.

614
01:01:40.645 --> 01:01:43.625
See Dr. Campbell and Ms. Sweeney

615
01:01:44.485 --> 01:01:47.225
In the winner of Chris Funks first year as superintendent,

616
01:01:47.405 --> 01:01:49.905
we held a data walk, our annual data walk,

617
01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:54.785
and we shared with the board, um, a piece of information

618
01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:57.025
where our third graders at the time

619
01:01:58.205 --> 01:02:01.145
for our African American students that only 30%

620
01:02:01.145 --> 01:02:02.585
of them were reading at grade level.

621
01:02:03.325 --> 01:02:07.185
And we made a concerted effort at that moment.

622
01:02:07.805 --> 01:02:11.905
And we made a pledge to you that we were going to make

623
01:02:12.855 --> 01:02:16.585
reading and early literacy a priority for the district.

624
01:02:16.765 --> 01:02:20.685
And along with that, we made a commitment

625
01:02:20.685 --> 01:02:23.365
that we were gonna do whatever we could to make sure that,

626
01:02:23.385 --> 01:02:24.765
and it was gonna be a district goal

627
01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.645
that every third grader was gonna read at grade

628
01:02:27.645 --> 01:02:29.445
level by the end of third grade.

629
01:02:30.025 --> 01:02:32.565
At the time we did not have a curriculum instruction

630
01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:36.165
department and we didn't have the type of support

631
01:02:36.235 --> 01:02:37.725
that we do now.

632
01:02:37.985 --> 01:02:39.685
So a lot has happened

633
01:02:39.985 --> 01:02:44.425
and since that day, we continue to have

634
01:02:45.425 --> 01:02:48.185
a goal that every third grader is gonna read at grade level

635
01:02:48.245 --> 01:02:49.545
by the end of third grade.

636
01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:53.185
And we have established a lot of support.

637
01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:55.065
And with that, I think

638
01:02:55.065 --> 01:02:58.465
that this particular report on early literacy,

639
01:02:59.265 --> 01:03:01.425
I am extremely proud of the team.

640
01:03:01.605 --> 01:03:04.065
I'm extremely proud of the leadership that

641
01:03:05.105 --> 01:03:06.665
Director Sweeney has put in place.

642
01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:09.345
And in addition to that, the support

643
01:03:09.935 --> 01:03:12.585
that the curriculum instruction department has given our

644
01:03:12.905 --> 01:03:14.905
teachers, our site admin,

645
01:03:15.445 --> 01:03:18.065
and we have in essence, revolutionized

646
01:03:18.245 --> 01:03:19.945
how we are teaching reading.

647
01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:23.905
It is, I remember distinctly the day in the meeting

648
01:03:23.995 --> 01:03:26.825
where Sherry behind me and Casey came to me

649
01:03:26.825 --> 01:03:28.745
and said, we need to do it differently

650
01:03:29.645 --> 01:03:31.545
and we have done it differently.

651
01:03:31.845 --> 01:03:34.585
And I'm so excited for you to hear this report

652
01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:36.825
because it's critically important.

653
01:03:36.845 --> 01:03:37.865
So with that being said, I'd like

654
01:03:37.865 --> 01:03:38.985
to introduce Sherry Sweeney.

655
01:03:42.115 --> 01:03:43.145
Thank you, Dr. Campbell.

656
01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:47.145
Um, good evening, uh, president Pelham, members

657
01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:49.545
of the board, um, superintendent Funk

658
01:03:49.545 --> 01:03:51.025
and members of Executive Cabinet.

659
01:03:51.335 --> 01:03:52.745
It's always a pleasure to come

660
01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:54.865
and speak about curriculum and instruction.

661
01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:56.865
Um, it's near and dear to all our hearts

662
01:03:56.885 --> 01:03:58.385
and the reason that, um,

663
01:03:58.745 --> 01:04:00.305
districts exist, school districts exist.

664
01:04:00.405 --> 01:04:02.705
So, um, it is my pleasure this evening

665
01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:07.185
to present three members, um, of our distinguished, uh,

666
01:04:07.255 --> 01:04:11.265
team here in DUSD to present a report on early literacy.

667
01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:13.065
The last time we were here to talk

668
01:04:13.065 --> 01:04:16.065
with you about early literacy was in December of 2022.

669
01:04:16.525 --> 01:04:19.705
Um, since that time, as Dr. Campbell uh, pointed out,

670
01:04:19.735 --> 01:04:22.105
there's been quite a a bit of work that's happened.

671
01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:24.305
Um, so you're gonna hear from three people tonight.

672
01:04:24.305 --> 01:04:27.145
You're gonna hear from Casey Nien, who is our coordinator

673
01:04:27.205 --> 01:04:28.825
of ELA and ELD.

674
01:04:29.005 --> 01:04:32.025
You're gonna hear from G Young Hong, who is a tosa.

675
01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.225
She is our early literacy specialist.

676
01:04:34.525 --> 01:04:35.745
And you're gonna hear from, um,

677
01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:38.705
a very distinguished teacher in our district, uh,

678
01:04:38.735 --> 01:04:42.345
Candace Whites, who is formerly a, uh, TOSA herself

679
01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.225
and a coach, and is now, uh, teaching.

680
01:04:44.645 --> 01:04:47.305
Um, and we really wanna present this report on behalf

681
01:04:47.305 --> 01:04:50.745
of all the, uh, teachers in, um, preschool

682
01:04:50.745 --> 01:04:53.265
through grade three who are really working, um,

683
01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:55.305
very diligently to be sure

684
01:04:55.305 --> 01:04:57.905
that all our students in those grades are able

685
01:04:57.905 --> 01:05:00.265
to read on grade level by the end of grade three.

686
01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:01.865
So I'm gonna turn it over to Casey.

687
01:05:07.795 --> 01:05:11.855
Thank you, Matt. Thank you, Sherry. Good evening.

688
01:05:11.855 --> 01:05:14.175
President Pelham, superintendent Funk

689
01:05:14.175 --> 01:05:15.175
and members of the board.

690
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.645
As Sherry and Matt shared.

691
01:05:18.585 --> 01:05:19.885
Um, we are here this evening

692
01:05:20.105 --> 01:05:23.005
to report on the district's early literacy programming,

693
01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:25.485
which is connected to two district goals

694
01:05:25.665 --> 01:05:28.365
and is foundational for success across all subject

695
01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:29.845
areas, at all grade levels.

696
01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:31.965
I think we could all agree

697
01:05:31.965 --> 01:05:34.365
that literacy can be a great equalizer

698
01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.685
and will open up opportunities for our students

699
01:05:36.785 --> 01:05:37.925
beyond their school years.

700
01:05:38.855 --> 01:05:39.885
About 20%

701
01:05:39.885 --> 01:05:42.325
of adults in the United States are at the lowest

702
01:05:42.325 --> 01:05:43.485
levels of literacy.

703
01:05:44.035 --> 01:05:47.445
This is a startling statistic, knowing that 95%

704
01:05:47.445 --> 01:05:49.325
of students have the cognitive abilities

705
01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:53.445
to be a proficient reader of this 95%,

706
01:05:53.705 --> 01:05:56.805
30% learn to read no matter how they are taught.

707
01:05:57.655 --> 01:06:02.125
50% need direct, explicit and systematic instruction

708
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.725
and foundational skills in order

709
01:06:03.725 --> 01:06:05.125
to become proficient readers.

710
01:06:05.755 --> 01:06:09.365
Even with high quality classroom instruction, about 15%

711
01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.485
of kids will need extra attention and support.

712
01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:16.055
Students who do not learn to read proficiently by the end

713
01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.575
of third grade are likely to be slower readers

714
01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:19.855
for the remainder of their lives.

715
01:06:20.545 --> 01:06:22.095
These statistics really show

716
01:06:22.155 --> 01:06:25.895
how critical strong reading instruction is in all grades,

717
01:06:26.395 --> 01:06:28.375
but particularly through third grade.

718
01:06:32.435 --> 01:06:37.205
Further policy supports based on the research help guide us

719
01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:40.325
toward thoughtful programming to meet our goals of reducing

720
01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:42.405
and eliminating barriers to learning

721
01:06:42.905 --> 01:06:44.205
and supporting students.

722
01:06:44.385 --> 01:06:47.485
In reading. By third grade, professional learning

723
01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:50.725
and ongoing support in the area of reading targets.

724
01:06:50.725 --> 01:06:54.725
The first, second, and third supports listed above, ensuring

725
01:06:54.725 --> 01:06:56.965
that our teachers have the most current knowledge

726
01:06:56.965 --> 01:06:58.885
of effective literacy instruction.

727
01:06:59.595 --> 01:07:02.445
Further, this knowledge will allow us to thoughtfully

728
01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:05.645
and critically evaluate the effectiveness of our current

729
01:07:06.485 --> 01:07:10.125
literacy programming, including as assessments to identify

730
01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.245
strengths and areas of need.

731
01:07:12.785 --> 01:07:16.125
Are instructional materials, including the identification

732
01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:17.285
of possible gaps

733
01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:20.765
and reflecting on our intervention model to ensure students

734
01:07:20.825 --> 01:07:23.165
who need extra support are being identified

735
01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:25.445
and the areas of need are targeted.

736
01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:27.205
This speaks to supports four

737
01:07:27.305 --> 01:07:32.145
and five as a result

738
01:07:32.145 --> 01:07:34.745
of looking at our instruction materials,

739
01:07:35.055 --> 01:07:36.625
support systems and data.

740
01:07:37.165 --> 01:07:39.145
We outlined a plan two years ago

741
01:07:39.285 --> 01:07:41.985
and have been working to implement it systematically.

742
01:07:42.805 --> 01:07:44.825
Our plan is outlined on the slide for you

743
01:07:45.575 --> 01:07:47.025
because it is challenging

744
01:07:47.025 --> 01:07:49.345
to significantly improve students' reading

745
01:07:49.345 --> 01:07:51.065
proficiency after third grade.

746
01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.185
Effective classroom instruction

747
01:07:53.185 --> 01:07:55.545
and intervention is essential in the early grades.

748
01:07:56.135 --> 01:07:57.825
This starts with professional learning.

749
01:07:57.965 --> 01:08:00.625
In order to support effective instruction at all levels,

750
01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:03.825
we want to prevent students from falling behind.

751
01:08:04.605 --> 01:08:05.745
In the following slides,

752
01:08:05.765 --> 01:08:08.345
we will share our progress in each of these areas.

753
01:08:14.205 --> 01:08:18.065
We know that programs do not teach kids teachers do,

754
01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.945
which is why ongoing professional development

755
01:08:20.945 --> 01:08:24.185
for teachers is a significant focus for us in the curriculum

756
01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:25.345
and instruction department.

757
01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.345
Since 2022,

758
01:08:27.605 --> 01:08:31.305
we began systematic high quality professional learning in

759
01:08:31.315 --> 01:08:32.945
early literacy with letters.

760
01:08:33.695 --> 01:08:36.465
Letters stands for language essentials for teachers

761
01:08:36.465 --> 01:08:37.665
of reading and spelling.

762
01:08:38.335 --> 01:08:39.945
This nationally recognized

763
01:08:39.945 --> 01:08:42.025
program, oh, I should not use the word.

764
01:08:42.165 --> 01:08:44.505
It is not a program. A nationally

765
01:08:45.025 --> 01:08:47.825
recognized professional development provides educators

766
01:08:47.895 --> 01:08:49.745
with an understanding of why learning

767
01:08:49.745 --> 01:08:50.945
to read is challenging.

768
01:08:52.365 --> 01:08:54.145
The science behind learning to read

769
01:08:54.205 --> 01:08:57.385
and what takes place in the brain when processing written

770
01:08:57.785 --> 01:09:01.345
language, the relationships among language, reading

771
01:09:01.485 --> 01:09:04.345
and writing, reliable assessments

772
01:09:04.405 --> 01:09:05.505
and theoretical models

773
01:09:05.605 --> 01:09:07.465
for interpreting individual differences

774
01:09:07.605 --> 01:09:08.625
and student achievement.

775
01:09:09.405 --> 01:09:11.945
Scientifically based best practices

776
01:09:11.945 --> 01:09:14.185
for instructional routines, activities

777
01:09:14.245 --> 01:09:17.065
and approaches to effectively teach reading.

778
01:09:18.045 --> 01:09:21.345
All with an emphasis on how to apply these PRI principles

779
01:09:21.405 --> 01:09:22.905
and practices to the classroom.

780
01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:26.585
By the end of next year, 2026,

781
01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:29.745
we should have nearly a hundred percent of all

782
01:09:29.745 --> 01:09:31.985
of our early elementary teachers trained

783
01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:33.225
in the science of reading.

784
01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:36.985
This will positively impact students by the thousands.

785
01:09:37.975 --> 01:09:39.505
This learning can be applied

786
01:09:39.525 --> 01:09:42.385
to any instructional materials being used in the classroom.

787
01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:45.825
In addition to the professional learning piece G Young,

788
01:09:45.925 --> 01:09:49.425
our TSA here with me tonight supports PLC teams

789
01:09:49.495 --> 01:09:52.345
with bringing this learning into practice in the form

790
01:09:52.345 --> 01:09:54.905
of curriculum training with our adopted materials,

791
01:09:55.655 --> 01:09:59.545
demo lessons and videos and PLC grade level team support.

792
01:10:00.255 --> 01:10:02.945
This training and support will put us in a great place

793
01:10:02.945 --> 01:10:05.185
where a materials adoption when the time comes,

794
01:10:05.925 --> 01:10:08.945
as all teachers will have the same foundational knowledge of

795
01:10:08.945 --> 01:10:11.945
what is needed to develop skilled proficient readers

796
01:10:12.365 --> 01:10:15.585
and what a high quality comprehension comprehensive

797
01:10:15.585 --> 01:10:16.985
program should include.

798
01:10:17.615 --> 01:10:20.745
This also helps us advance our promise of a guaranteed

799
01:10:20.805 --> 01:10:22.625
and viable curriculum for all students

800
01:10:23.205 --> 01:10:25.665
by providing evidence-based strategies

801
01:10:25.725 --> 01:10:27.145
for our students right now.

802
01:10:28.005 --> 01:10:29.425
Now I'll turn it over to GI Young

803
01:10:29.485 --> 01:10:31.545
and she's gonna share more about instruction.

804
01:10:37.105 --> 01:10:40.515
Good evening. Casey just talked about how curriculum

805
01:10:40.515 --> 01:10:42.475
and instruction identified the need

806
01:10:42.475 --> 01:10:43.915
for structured literacy training

807
01:10:44.335 --> 01:10:46.915
and what our work has looked like for the last two years.

808
01:10:47.055 --> 01:10:50.115
Up to now, I'm gonna talk about the impact

809
01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:51.675
of our work at the level of the student

810
01:10:51.675 --> 01:10:54.315
and teacher, classroom and district.

811
01:10:55.105 --> 01:10:57.195
When I first spoke with you two years ago,

812
01:10:57.315 --> 01:10:59.795
I shared this model known as Scarborough's Reading Rope

813
01:11:00.185 --> 01:11:01.835
that identifies strands of a rope

814
01:11:01.835 --> 01:11:05.515
that weave together over time to result in skilled reading.

815
01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.635
This model tells us

816
01:11:08.065 --> 01:11:10.715
that skilled reading requires word recognition.

817
01:11:11.045 --> 01:11:13.165
These are the blue strands, which is

818
01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:15.605
what our 100 plus teachers in cohort

819
01:11:15.735 --> 01:11:17.085
three are currently learning.

820
01:11:17.505 --> 01:11:18.885
In the letters training that Casey

821
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.525
and I are delivering this year,

822
01:11:21.115 --> 01:11:24.045
skilled reading also involves language comprehension.

823
01:11:24.575 --> 01:11:27.205
These are the red strands, which will be the emphasis

824
01:11:27.205 --> 01:11:29.405
of next year's training for our teachers.

825
01:11:30.305 --> 01:11:33.725
The model is a theoretical way to visualize skilled reading,

826
01:11:34.105 --> 01:11:37.325
but as a teacher, what matters most is

827
01:11:37.325 --> 01:11:38.445
what I can put into action

828
01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:42.445
and practice with students, which is where this model has

829
01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:45.525
so much utility because every strand is a

830
01:11:45.725 --> 01:11:46.805
teaching or assessment point.

831
01:11:47.195 --> 01:11:48.565
Therefore, teachers can

832
01:11:48.665 --> 01:11:52.645
and have been using this model to identify the exact focus

833
01:11:52.665 --> 01:11:54.245
of a lesson and exactly

834
01:11:54.315 --> 01:11:56.325
what a student needs more practice with.

835
01:11:59.845 --> 01:12:02.425
The learning that we started two years ago has also helped

836
01:12:02.445 --> 01:12:03.545
to align curriculum

837
01:12:03.545 --> 01:12:06.265
and instruction across classrooms in the district.

838
01:12:06.725 --> 01:12:10.265
In 2000, the national reading panel identified five

839
01:12:10.415 --> 01:12:11.625
pillars of literacy.

840
01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:14.545
These foundational supports are critical

841
01:12:14.565 --> 01:12:16.545
for effective literacy instruction.

842
01:12:17.085 --> 01:12:21.465
The five pillars are phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency,

843
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.865
vocabulary, and language comprehension.

844
01:12:25.005 --> 01:12:27.625
Dublin adopted star, fallen kindergarten

845
01:12:27.725 --> 01:12:30.305
and benchmark in grades one through five

846
01:12:30.765 --> 01:12:35.025
as comprehensive core ELA curriculum a few years prior

847
01:12:35.085 --> 01:12:37.305
to the creation of the c and i team.

848
01:12:38.045 --> 01:12:39.545
But as we looked at the research

849
01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:41.065
and applied it to our curriculum

850
01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.785
and district data, we saw very clear opportunities

851
01:12:43.835 --> 01:12:45.225
where we could better support

852
01:12:45.325 --> 01:12:48.345
and align what we do in the classroom with

853
01:12:48.345 --> 01:12:51.025
what the research says more effectively meets

854
01:12:51.025 --> 01:12:52.145
the needs of all students.

855
01:12:52.765 --> 01:12:55.785
The five pillars have been instrumental in helping us frame

856
01:12:55.785 --> 01:12:57.945
these discussions and decisions.

857
01:12:58.445 --> 01:13:02.235
So what have we done? Two years ago, we brought in Haggerty

858
01:13:02.235 --> 01:13:04.635
to address the foundational pillar of phonemic awareness

859
01:13:05.175 --> 01:13:07.915
as explicitly and systematically as possible.

860
01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:11.235
We spent almost one and a half years providing training

861
01:13:11.295 --> 01:13:14.235
and support to everyone who might use the curriculum.

862
01:13:14.665 --> 01:13:15.835
Currently it is used

863
01:13:15.835 --> 01:13:18.435
as tier one whole group curriculum in preschool

864
01:13:18.585 --> 01:13:22.035
through first grade and as tier two small group instruction

865
01:13:22.055 --> 01:13:23.275
and second and third grade.

866
01:13:25.195 --> 01:13:28.375
The research also revealed critical foundational skills

867
01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:32.095
that our youngest students entering pre-kindergarten need in

868
01:13:32.095 --> 01:13:33.775
order to fully access the learning

869
01:13:33.775 --> 01:13:36.335
that they will receive in the critical primary grades.

870
01:13:36.805 --> 01:13:40.175
Therefore, last year one of our biggest priorities was

871
01:13:40.175 --> 01:13:41.495
to ensure that preschool

872
01:13:41.515 --> 01:13:45.815
and TK had a curriculum learning without tears, as well

873
01:13:45.815 --> 01:13:49.375
as training and professional development on the most current

874
01:13:49.735 --> 01:13:51.295
research to support their ability

875
01:13:51.715 --> 01:13:53.375
to teach the foundational skills

876
01:13:53.765 --> 01:13:56.935
that pre-kindergarten students need to succeed in pre-K

877
01:13:57.235 --> 01:13:59.255
as well as when they move on to the primary grades.

878
01:14:00.205 --> 01:14:03.375
Finally, this year we are piloting Core Five

879
01:14:03.445 --> 01:14:05.095
with over 100 teachers.

880
01:14:05.765 --> 01:14:09.015
Core Five is a blended learning supplemental program

881
01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.135
that will help us explicitly

882
01:14:11.205 --> 01:14:14.405
and systematically address all five pillars of literacy.

883
01:14:14.955 --> 01:14:17.845
What makes Core Five different from other supplemental

884
01:14:17.945 --> 01:14:19.685
online programs is

885
01:14:19.685 --> 01:14:22.405
that there is an explicit teacher instruction piece

886
01:14:22.795 --> 01:14:24.565
that is fully aligned to the research

887
01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:26.445
and built into the design of the program.

888
01:14:27.235 --> 01:14:30.365
This honors what we know about the key role the teachers

889
01:14:30.395 --> 01:14:31.685
play in student outcomes.

890
01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:35.405
It will also support coherence in small group instruction

891
01:14:35.825 --> 01:14:38.125
across the district, enabling us

892
01:14:38.145 --> 01:14:41.245
to continue working towards providing all Dublin students

893
01:14:41.555 --> 01:14:43.765
with a guaranteed and viable curriculum.

894
01:14:47.325 --> 01:14:51.025
As the CNI team considered how to align Dublin's curriculum

895
01:14:51.045 --> 01:14:54.545
and instruction with the most current research, our goal was

896
01:14:54.545 --> 01:14:56.785
to strengthen Dublin's system of support

897
01:14:57.205 --> 01:14:59.585
by creating a literacy ecosystem

898
01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:01.785
that could be truly supportive of students

899
01:15:02.085 --> 01:15:04.945
and teachers, which is why we created the reading

900
01:15:05.015 --> 01:15:06.265
flow chart that you see here.

901
01:15:07.245 --> 01:15:09.945
We begin with screeners taken by all students.

902
01:15:10.615 --> 01:15:13.065
Screeners provide a balcony view of

903
01:15:13.065 --> 01:15:16.185
how all students are doing, but they're also important

904
01:15:16.185 --> 01:15:19.785
because they identify specific students who we may need

905
01:15:19.785 --> 01:15:22.225
to do additional diagnostics with so

906
01:15:22.225 --> 01:15:23.825
that we can provide additional support

907
01:15:23.885 --> 01:15:26.545
and practice opportunities that are meaningful,

908
01:15:26.575 --> 01:15:28.145
effective, and efficient.

909
01:15:29.005 --> 01:15:31.145
In addition to clarifying the different tiers

910
01:15:31.145 --> 01:15:34.825
of instruction, the teacher facing flowchart is hyperlinked

911
01:15:34.975 --> 01:15:37.745
with documents that we created to support teachers.

912
01:15:38.155 --> 01:15:41.025
These documents include information on how

913
01:15:41.025 --> 01:15:42.305
to administer assessments

914
01:15:42.365 --> 01:15:43.585
and the different information

915
01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:47.865
that can be gleaned from the score reports, tiered practices

916
01:15:47.865 --> 01:15:49.545
that can be used to scaffold learning,

917
01:15:49.635 --> 01:15:51.065
whole group or small group.

918
01:15:51.645 --> 01:15:54.305
And a document that we are able to roll out this year.

919
01:15:54.845 --> 01:15:56.665
Now that we're training the remaining K

920
01:15:56.665 --> 01:15:57.985
through third grade teachers,

921
01:15:58.455 --> 01:16:01.065
this document contains additional diagnostics

922
01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:04.745
that can be used to drill down to specific skill gaps,

923
01:16:05.285 --> 01:16:06.905
as well as information on how

924
01:16:06.905 --> 01:16:10.065
to address those gaps using district adopted curriculum.

925
01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:14.105
At this point I'd like to introduce Candace Whites,

926
01:16:14.185 --> 01:16:15.985
a former literacy specialist

927
01:16:16.325 --> 01:16:18.825
and current teacher who has been in Dublin for many years.

928
01:16:19.335 --> 01:16:21.945
Candace will be sharing her experience with letters

929
01:16:22.325 --> 01:16:24.905
and how it has impacted what she does with her students.

930
01:16:28.695 --> 01:16:31.305
Good evening. I have, um,

931
01:16:31.525 --> 01:16:34.665
per personally witnessed the profound impact that direct,

932
01:16:35.145 --> 01:16:36.865
explicit and systematic instruction

933
01:16:36.865 --> 01:16:39.065
and reading has on helping our students become

934
01:16:39.245 --> 01:16:40.265
strong readers.

935
01:16:40.865 --> 01:16:43.555
Letters training has made me more purposeful

936
01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:44.795
with literacy instruction.

937
01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:47.035
My approach is now more focused

938
01:16:47.215 --> 01:16:50.035
and targeted to meet the specific needs of our students.

939
01:16:50.795 --> 01:16:53.045
I've applied the knowledge gained from the trainings

940
01:16:53.045 --> 01:16:54.645
to my daily teaching practices

941
01:16:55.145 --> 01:16:56.805
and when working with grade level teams.

942
01:16:58.105 --> 01:17:00.085
For example, last year as a third grade teacher

943
01:17:00.555 --> 01:17:04.285
with the support from our early literacy TSAG Young,

944
01:17:04.705 --> 01:17:08.165
our PLC team gave an array of assessments to our students so

945
01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:11.005
that we could narrow down what each student needed

946
01:17:11.345 --> 01:17:12.565
to be successful in reading.

947
01:17:13.385 --> 01:17:15.005
One being the phonological awareness

948
01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.365
screening test or the past.

949
01:17:17.645 --> 01:17:20.415
That assessment helped us form our RRTI groups

950
01:17:20.955 --> 01:17:22.295
and we used Haggerty so

951
01:17:22.295 --> 01:17:25.015
that we could provide our students explicit systematic

952
01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:27.375
instruction, phonemic awareness for the students

953
01:17:27.675 --> 01:17:29.215
who were far below grade level.

954
01:17:29.955 --> 01:17:33.495
We started with 10 students in our RTI group in October.

955
01:17:34.395 --> 01:17:36.935
By May only three students remained in RTI,

956
01:17:37.295 --> 01:17:38.455
focusing on phonemic awareness.

957
01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:41.775
This resulted in a 70% success rate in that area.

958
01:17:42.285 --> 01:17:44.095
With the guidance of G Young, we were able

959
01:17:44.095 --> 01:17:47.095
to significantly advance our students' reading development

960
01:17:47.155 --> 01:17:51.735
and also enhance our pedagogy as teachers in collaborating

961
01:17:51.735 --> 01:17:54.335
with other teachers and discussing their experiences at

962
01:17:54.335 --> 01:17:55.975
other school sites here in Dublin,

963
01:17:56.175 --> 01:17:58.575
I consistently hear the same feedback

964
01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:02.215
that teachers feel more confident now in teaching reading

965
01:18:02.485 --> 01:18:06.535
with letters and the support that we have with our team.

966
01:18:07.495 --> 01:18:08.895
Teachers have become more intentional

967
01:18:08.895 --> 01:18:10.135
with their reading activities

968
01:18:10.435 --> 01:18:12.895
and they say that they're witnessing the positive impact on

969
01:18:12.895 --> 01:18:14.695
their students' reading abilities, whether

970
01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:17.455
that be phonemic awareness, phonics fluency,

971
01:18:17.505 --> 01:18:19.055
vocabulary or comprehension.

972
01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:24.825
I appreciate how letters has been rolled out in DUSD.

973
01:18:25.165 --> 01:18:28.065
The two year plan was carefully outlined and implemented

974
01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:32.165
and in my opinion, the critical aspect moving forward will

975
01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:33.605
be the ongoing follow up

976
01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:36.245
and continued support for professional development

977
01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:37.765
for teachers and PLC teams.

978
01:18:38.355 --> 01:18:39.885
This is essential in my opinion,

979
01:18:39.985 --> 01:18:42.765
as our students deserve the highest quality of instruction

980
01:18:43.105 --> 01:18:45.845
and support to ensure their success as readers.

981
01:18:46.415 --> 01:18:47.415
Thank you.

982
01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:55.125
Thank you. Mm-Hmm. So,

983
01:18:55.245 --> 01:18:57.445
G Young and I were recently looking at the cast data

984
01:18:57.465 --> 01:18:58.965
of our third graders last year,

985
01:18:59.225 --> 01:19:02.085
and we were encouraged to see a slight uptick in the data.

986
01:19:02.085 --> 01:19:03.845
78.83%

987
01:19:03.945 --> 01:19:06.725
and 20 23 24 compared

988
01:19:06.725 --> 01:19:09.805
to 78.53% in 2223.

989
01:19:10.765 --> 01:19:13.005
Remember, these students were in kindergarten during covid

990
01:19:13.505 --> 01:19:14.965
and they were either wearing masks

991
01:19:15.225 --> 01:19:17.285
or online when learning the sounds.

992
01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:20.325
A very challenging way to learn these critical skills.

993
01:19:21.185 --> 01:19:24.045
Our hope is our data will continue to trend positively

994
01:19:24.045 --> 01:19:26.245
with our emphasis on early literacy.

995
01:19:27.015 --> 01:19:29.485
There are a lot of great things happening in this area.

996
01:19:30.275 --> 01:19:33.405
Systems are being put in place, resources are available.

997
01:19:33.985 --> 01:19:35.085
And most importantly,

998
01:19:35.185 --> 01:19:38.125
we have dedicated teachers here in Dublin who are committed

999
01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:40.085
to learning themselves in order

1000
01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:43.645
to provide top-notch literacy instruction to our students.

1001
01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:46.045
We are proud of the work being done

1002
01:19:46.065 --> 01:19:48.245
to support our students in becoming skilled,

1003
01:19:48.255 --> 01:19:49.485
proficient readers.

1004
01:19:49.905 --> 01:19:51.525
And we are fortunate to have the support

1005
01:19:51.545 --> 01:19:52.805
and expertise of G Young,

1006
01:19:52.825 --> 01:19:55.845
our early literacy teacher on special assignment whose depth

1007
01:19:55.845 --> 01:19:57.885
of knowledge in this area is unmatched.

1008
01:19:57.985 --> 01:19:59.525
We could not do this work without her.

1009
01:20:00.065 --> 01:20:01.605
We appreciate the opportunity

1010
01:20:01.705 --> 01:20:04.645
to provide an update on our early literacy programming.

1011
01:20:04.855 --> 01:20:08.885
Thank you. And we are happy to take any comments

1012
01:20:08.945 --> 01:20:10.485
or questions at this time. Great, thank you.

1013
01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:13.085
Does anyone have any questions? Trustee Speck,

1014
01:20:13.855 --> 01:20:15.165
Thank you for the presentation.

1015
01:20:15.265 --> 01:20:17.605
Um, it's great to see the work that's going into this goal

1016
01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:19.565
that we've set and, um, and,

1017
01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:20.965
and understand everything going into it.

1018
01:20:21.065 --> 01:20:22.765
Um, I wanted to, uh,

1019
01:20:22.825 --> 01:20:24.565
ask some questions on the professional learning.

1020
01:20:25.145 --> 01:20:27.045
So, um, you did the different cohorts.

1021
01:20:27.145 --> 01:20:28.405
I'm wondering with the first cohort,

1022
01:20:28.595 --> 01:20:30.605
were there any learnings that you had of things

1023
01:20:30.605 --> 01:20:32.085
that you needed to do differently

1024
01:20:32.545 --> 01:20:33.925
or maybe you needed to stop?

1025
01:20:34.265 --> 01:20:37.085
Um, so I'm just curious about the, um,

1026
01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:39.045
how it transitioned, um, into the next year.

1027
01:20:39.205 --> 01:20:41.125
Learnings from that. And then the other question is around,

1028
01:20:41.865 --> 01:20:43.605
um, how do we continue that?

1029
01:20:43.665 --> 01:20:45.725
So you said you think you're hitting a hundred percent

1030
01:20:45.725 --> 01:20:46.965
of the teachers, which is great,

1031
01:20:47.305 --> 01:20:49.725
but I know next year we'll have some new teachers.

1032
01:20:50.105 --> 01:20:51.965
So how do they learn and,

1033
01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:54.845
and what's the way to have that continuity, um,

1034
01:20:54.845 --> 01:20:56.965
with new teachers that come into our district? Sure.

1035
01:20:57.835 --> 01:20:59.005
Take that. Yeah, sure.

1036
01:20:59.585 --> 01:21:03.685
So when we started in 2022, um, the professional learning

1037
01:21:03.685 --> 01:21:05.685
with letters was entirely voluntary.

1038
01:21:06.265 --> 01:21:08.245
So it was done after the school day

1039
01:21:08.585 --> 01:21:11.245
and we had letters, faci, national letters,

1040
01:21:11.405 --> 01:21:14.445
facilitators coming in to support our teachers.

1041
01:21:14.865 --> 01:21:17.925
And the sessions were either, um, they were non-school days,

1042
01:21:18.445 --> 01:21:20.685
Saturdays, um, some were virtual.

1043
01:21:21.545 --> 01:21:23.125
Um, so we did that for two years.

1044
01:21:23.185 --> 01:21:25.165
So it was entirely v virtual for those,

1045
01:21:25.185 --> 01:21:26.885
or voluntary for those teachers.

1046
01:21:27.545 --> 01:21:30.725
Um, we did take a poll midway through the year,

1047
01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:31.845
how is this working for you?

1048
01:21:31.945 --> 01:21:33.925
Do you like the in person? Does it virtual work?

1049
01:21:33.925 --> 01:21:35.965
So we did make some adjustments to meet, um,

1050
01:21:36.545 --> 01:21:38.245
the participants' needs at that time.

1051
01:21:38.245 --> 01:21:39.925
That continued for two years.

1052
01:21:40.585 --> 01:21:42.605
Um, but we also know that, um,

1053
01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:46.765
not everyone can do it on Saturdays and

1054
01:21:46.775 --> 01:21:48.045
after school, we know.

1055
01:21:48.345 --> 01:21:50.885
Um, we know that's not always possible.

1056
01:21:51.025 --> 01:21:52.325
So our goal was always

1057
01:21:52.385 --> 01:21:54.085
to get the training within the school day.

1058
01:21:54.105 --> 01:21:55.325
And that's what's happening now.

1059
01:21:55.325 --> 01:21:57.645
That's how we're able to train the rest

1060
01:21:57.665 --> 01:22:00.565
of our teachers is we have sublease days

1061
01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.765
and we have small cohorts because of subs.

1062
01:22:02.765 --> 01:22:03.805
We have small cohorts.

1063
01:22:03.805 --> 01:22:07.845
So J Young and I just completed the unit one training year

1064
01:22:07.905 --> 01:22:09.005
one for these teachers.

1065
01:22:09.745 --> 01:22:11.565
Um, the last one was October 3rd.

1066
01:22:11.825 --> 01:22:13.365
And so we have six groups

1067
01:22:13.985 --> 01:22:16.285
of about 20 teachers each that are going through.

1068
01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:19.885
And we are, um, busily preparing for unit two.

1069
01:22:19.945 --> 01:22:22.645
So we have made some adjust adjustments along the way

1070
01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:23.845
as far as the logistics.

1071
01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:26.165
And, um, at the beginning of the year also,

1072
01:22:26.165 --> 01:22:28.005
when we first started, we were doing book clubs.

1073
01:22:28.105 --> 01:22:30.805
We wanted to make sure, um, teachers had a chance

1074
01:22:30.805 --> 01:22:31.925
to process the information.

1075
01:22:32.085 --> 01:22:35.925
'cause there isn't, um, independent coursework component now

1076
01:22:36.595 --> 01:22:38.165
that we're doing it within the school day.

1077
01:22:38.565 --> 01:22:40.805
G Young and I are facilitating the trainings ourselves.

1078
01:22:40.905 --> 01:22:42.165
So it is now in-house.

1079
01:22:42.905 --> 01:22:45.965
And the great thing about this is we know

1080
01:22:45.985 --> 01:22:47.365
what's happening here in Dublin.

1081
01:22:47.365 --> 01:22:49.685
We know what adopted curriculum materials we use.

1082
01:22:49.705 --> 01:22:53.965
We know the data, so we're able to customize the training,

1083
01:22:54.465 --> 01:22:56.205
um, having those things in mind.

1084
01:22:56.265 --> 01:22:58.165
So those are some of the changes that we've made.

1085
01:22:58.545 --> 01:23:02.125
Um, as far as getting, um, new teachers up to speed now

1086
01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:04.685
that we have in-house facilitation, hopefully, um,

1087
01:23:05.185 --> 01:23:07.205
budget dependent will be able to continue that.

1088
01:23:08.145 --> 01:23:09.645
Can I add to that? Absolutely.

1089
01:23:09.825 --> 01:23:11.925
Um, well first of all, I do wanna point out, uh,

1090
01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:13.205
it's, it's really remarkable.

1091
01:23:13.545 --> 01:23:17.365
Uh, Casey and G Young not only did the full, um, training

1092
01:23:17.555 --> 01:23:19.805
that the teachers did, um, and I did that as well,

1093
01:23:20.185 --> 01:23:22.085
but they went through the facilitator training.

1094
01:23:22.225 --> 01:23:24.725
So in order to deliver this training, they had

1095
01:23:24.725 --> 01:23:25.885
to do an additional course.

1096
01:23:25.885 --> 01:23:28.565
They had to pass tests, um, to be, uh,

1097
01:23:28.635 --> 01:23:30.005
qualified to do the training.

1098
01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:34.005
And so they're now fully, um, accredited by letters

1099
01:23:34.105 --> 01:23:35.245
to do the training in-house.

1100
01:23:35.245 --> 01:23:36.965
So we no longer have to, uh, pay

1101
01:23:36.965 --> 01:23:39.045
for those expenses, uh, with our vendor.

1102
01:23:39.045 --> 01:23:42.885
We're able to use them. Um, and then as Casey pointed out,

1103
01:23:42.885 --> 01:23:45.045
because of the sub shortage, um, and

1104
01:23:45.045 --> 01:23:46.605
because we didn't wanna pull teachers back,

1105
01:23:46.665 --> 01:23:48.085
we have multiple groups.

1106
01:23:48.145 --> 01:23:49.645
So we have fo four different groups

1107
01:23:49.665 --> 01:23:51.005
of about 20 teachers each

1108
01:23:51.005 --> 01:23:52.245
this year who are going through it.

1109
01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:54.085
And they each get released four days.

1110
01:23:54.465 --> 01:23:57.045
So that's 16 days of training that Casey

1111
01:23:57.145 --> 01:23:59.205
and G Young will do, um, over the course of this year

1112
01:23:59.225 --> 01:24:01.005
and another 16 next year.

1113
01:24:01.385 --> 01:24:04.645
So that's the plan. Um, the other thing I wanted to say is

1114
01:24:04.645 --> 01:24:07.685
that it's not just the teachers that we're working with, um,

1115
01:24:08.065 --> 01:24:10.765
gee Young put together a, uh, training

1116
01:24:10.825 --> 01:24:11.885
for our administrators.

1117
01:24:11.905 --> 01:24:14.685
So we recently provided training, um, on benchmark

1118
01:24:14.685 --> 01:24:17.525
for our administrators with, which included, um,

1119
01:24:17.875 --> 01:24:19.725
information about the science of reading

1120
01:24:19.725 --> 01:24:20.765
and what we're doing with letters.

1121
01:24:21.065 --> 01:24:23.565
And they also had access to go through the training.

1122
01:24:23.665 --> 01:24:25.205
So they have a separate training

1123
01:24:25.565 --> 01:24:26.965
specifically for administrators.

1124
01:24:27.355 --> 01:24:29.845
Last year we did a few, uh, classroom walkthroughs.

1125
01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:32.885
So we worked with principals, um, walked through classrooms

1126
01:24:32.885 --> 01:24:34.965
and began to look at what, um, some of the,

1127
01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:36.525
uh, instruction was looking like.

1128
01:24:36.525 --> 01:24:40.085
And we have an a plan for later this year to do some more of

1129
01:24:40.085 --> 01:24:42.645
that and also to, uh, bring some teachers along with us

1130
01:24:42.905 --> 01:24:44.765
so teachers can see each other, um,

1131
01:24:44.765 --> 01:24:46.325
engaged in, in the teaching.

1132
01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:48.645
So just wanted to highlight those things as well. Thank

1133
01:24:48.645 --> 01:24:49.645
You. Um,

1134
01:24:49.645 --> 01:24:53.255
do you know if any of the, the place,

1135
01:24:53.495 --> 01:24:57.095
I know we get teachers from a variety of of schools, um,

1136
01:24:57.155 --> 01:24:58.935
but are we aware of any, um,

1137
01:24:59.005 --> 01:25:01.455
that are you putting this into the curriculum?

1138
01:25:01.765 --> 01:25:04.975
Like as we look to hire elementary ed, stu, um, you know,

1139
01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:09.655
people, um, as teachers, do we think they're getting any

1140
01:25:09.655 --> 01:25:12.255
of this kind of, um, learnings in school?

1141
01:25:13.235 --> 01:25:15.135
We know that the state has been working

1142
01:25:15.135 --> 01:25:18.455
with teacher preparation programs to include this as part

1143
01:25:18.455 --> 01:25:19.815
of the teacher preparation program.

1144
01:25:20.475 --> 01:25:21.775
And um, Heather

1145
01:25:21.835 --> 01:25:24.095
and I have had conversations about, um,

1146
01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:27.855
when we have postings, um, putting in a preference for

1147
01:25:28.535 --> 01:25:30.735
teachers who have this kind of training it if

1148
01:25:30.735 --> 01:25:32.255
for early elementary positions.

1149
01:25:32.275 --> 01:25:35.535
So, um, there are ways for us to continue to recruit

1150
01:25:35.635 --> 01:25:38.415
and ensure that our new teachers coming in, um,

1151
01:25:38.485 --> 01:25:39.695
have some of that background.

1152
01:25:39.955 --> 01:25:41.295
But again, um, with Casey

1153
01:25:41.355 --> 01:25:45.015
and G Young, fully trained, I'm, I'm expecting, um,

1154
01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:47.455
next year that we will have teachers that we'll need to pull

1155
01:25:47.455 --> 01:25:48.695
as a small group, um,

1156
01:25:48.695 --> 01:25:51.615
and do this training with um, um, maybe even just four

1157
01:25:51.615 --> 01:25:54.055
or five, six new teachers. But we would, we would do that.

1158
01:25:54.445 --> 01:25:58.055
Okay. Thank you Trustee Blackman.

1159
01:25:59.075 --> 01:26:02.365
Awesome presentation. This is such a wonderful program.

1160
01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:04.405
I'm so thrilled that it started.

1161
01:26:04.505 --> 01:26:05.845
So thank you for all your work.

1162
01:26:06.305 --> 01:26:08.765
Um, I wanna ask a couple little just fine point

1163
01:26:09.005 --> 01:26:10.125
questions in the presentation.

1164
01:26:10.345 --> 01:26:12.685
Um, you talked about effective reading instruction,

1165
01:26:13.475 --> 01:26:17.365
also sufficient direct instruction as well as um,

1166
01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.365
high quality learning opportunities.

1167
01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:22.045
And there is, I think one

1168
01:26:22.045 --> 01:26:23.165
of the reasons why we're coming at this,

1169
01:26:23.165 --> 01:26:24.845
and correct me if I'm wrong, is

1170
01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:28.005
that there are inequities in students that come to us

1171
01:26:28.555 --> 01:26:31.965
that create barriers to learning if they're not able

1172
01:26:31.985 --> 01:26:34.565
to read when they arrive and they need that assistance.

1173
01:26:34.585 --> 01:26:37.245
And so being able to teach them those steps along the way.

1174
01:26:37.745 --> 01:26:40.485
So when the statement on your presentation thing,

1175
01:26:40.485 --> 01:26:42.085
it was on slide two, you talked about reduce

1176
01:26:42.085 --> 01:26:43.405
or eliminate barriers to learning.

1177
01:26:44.145 --> 01:26:46.525
Are you talking about the barriers of students coming to us

1178
01:26:46.555 --> 01:26:49.085
that and so we're basically trying to reduce the barriers

1179
01:26:49.085 --> 01:26:51.045
that would basically accumulate over time if they

1180
01:26:51.045 --> 01:26:52.165
don't receive proper instruction?

1181
01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:55.805
Or is it the barriers that we never really did the, the work

1182
01:26:55.865 --> 01:26:59.285
to develop a program, i I sorry to use the word program,

1183
01:26:59.385 --> 01:27:01.165
but a program and training

1184
01:27:01.275 --> 01:27:04.405
that would actually assist students to learn in this way

1185
01:27:04.475 --> 01:27:06.645
that you've been trained to teach them?

1186
01:27:07.185 --> 01:27:08.765
I'm trying to understand when we talk about,

1187
01:27:09.185 --> 01:27:10.965
we use the term equity very loosely,

1188
01:27:11.065 --> 01:27:13.165
but what barrier are we talking about when we

1189
01:27:13.165 --> 01:27:14.365
present it in the presentation?

1190
01:27:14.365 --> 01:27:15.365
Exactly.

1191
01:27:16.835 --> 01:27:20.985
Mm-Hmm. Um, I really think that it depends on the student.

1192
01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:22.185
It's very individual.

1193
01:27:22.485 --> 01:27:24.465
And if you look at the graph on that page,

1194
01:27:24.895 --> 01:27:27.905
some students just have learning differences, right?

1195
01:27:27.965 --> 01:27:29.025
So that could be a barrier.

1196
01:27:29.055 --> 01:27:31.745
It's not that they're not able to learn to read, um,

1197
01:27:31.765 --> 01:27:33.545
but they may need multisensory supports.

1198
01:27:33.545 --> 01:27:35.025
They may just learn a little bit differently.

1199
01:27:35.925 --> 01:27:39.625
Um, we also know that not every student may have a

1200
01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:40.745
rich home environment.

1201
01:27:41.285 --> 01:27:43.545
Um, not all students maybe go to preschool.

1202
01:27:44.045 --> 01:27:45.865
So they're coming in with different levels

1203
01:27:45.965 --> 01:27:47.145
of literacy as well.

1204
01:27:47.325 --> 01:27:50.185
So our job is to make sure that we are developing, um,

1205
01:27:50.185 --> 01:27:52.425
skilled proficient readers regardless of

1206
01:27:52.425 --> 01:27:53.505
where kids are coming in.

1207
01:27:55.075 --> 01:27:56.625
Thank you. So if, um,

1208
01:27:57.055 --> 01:27:58.545
it's okay, I have just a couple comments.

1209
01:27:59.365 --> 01:28:00.825
Um, a few things that I'd like

1210
01:28:00.825 --> 01:28:02.865
to note in some of the discussions.

1211
01:28:03.085 --> 01:28:05.865
Um, you had mentioned, I love the diagram by the way,

1212
01:28:05.865 --> 01:28:07.425
of this wonderful rope

1213
01:28:07.685 --> 01:28:09.425
and it's probably a lot messier than the diagram

1214
01:28:09.495 --> 01:28:11.145
that you showed, but it's a wonderful diagram

1215
01:28:11.365 --> 01:28:12.225
to illustrate exactly

1216
01:28:12.225 --> 01:28:13.385
what you're trying to do with these students.

1217
01:28:14.045 --> 01:28:17.225
The one thing that I thought was missing in the presentation

1218
01:28:17.405 --> 01:28:19.985
was the element of partnering with families and parents.

1219
01:28:20.765 --> 01:28:23.505
Um, I know that when a child goes home, what they bring home

1220
01:28:23.505 --> 01:28:25.345
with them and how it's supported home is really important.

1221
01:28:25.445 --> 01:28:27.545
So it'd be helpful to actually kind of roll that in.

1222
01:28:27.765 --> 01:28:28.825
And the reason why I bring this up

1223
01:28:28.825 --> 01:28:30.705
and I was asking the question about where's the barrier

1224
01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:33.825
equity is that we are pushing back earlier

1225
01:28:33.965 --> 01:28:35.865
and earlier when students can come to us.

1226
01:28:35.965 --> 01:28:38.705
So we can start that work as early as possible.

1227
01:28:38.805 --> 01:28:41.825
But I know that the district does a lot of um,

1228
01:28:42.335 --> 01:28:43.945
community sort of presentations,

1229
01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:45.625
whether it's suicide prevention,

1230
01:28:45.805 --> 01:28:47.865
mental health awareness, other things like that.

1231
01:28:47.925 --> 01:28:50.385
And from a, what we could do

1232
01:28:50.485 --> 01:28:53.745
to up the ante a little bit more for those students coming

1233
01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:56.665
to us would be to have some sort of a presentation

1234
01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:00.505
or program to educate families who have very young children

1235
01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.365
just about reading to them.

1236
01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:05.565
Because if we start that early, um,

1237
01:29:05.865 --> 01:29:08.665
and we engage in parents so that they understand

1238
01:29:09.095 --> 01:29:11.025
what would occur when they get to us

1239
01:29:11.125 --> 01:29:13.305
and then that sort of heavy lift to bring them up

1240
01:29:13.305 --> 01:29:15.945
to a certain level might engage them earlier on.

1241
01:29:16.485 --> 01:29:18.425
And honestly, as a first parent,

1242
01:29:18.845 --> 01:29:20.625
nobody was really telling me how important it was.

1243
01:29:20.785 --> 01:29:22.425
Although I was hearing like a family member

1244
01:29:22.425 --> 01:29:24.065
who was a teacher saying, just read to them.

1245
01:29:24.065 --> 01:29:25.025
Just read to them every single

1246
01:29:25.025 --> 01:29:26.105
day, whatever it is, doesn't matter.

1247
01:29:26.105 --> 01:29:29.065
Garbage, it'd be off of a box of cereal, doesn't matter.

1248
01:29:29.525 --> 01:29:31.625
And they were right. It's just that you don't understand

1249
01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:33.105
'cause nobody's actually explaining it to you.

1250
01:29:33.205 --> 01:29:36.505
So, and for those that are really busy, it's very difficult

1251
01:29:36.505 --> 01:29:38.385
for them to find those moments in times

1252
01:29:38.385 --> 01:29:40.825
where maybe they can actually spend just a half an hour

1253
01:29:40.825 --> 01:29:42.185
with a child to just read to them.

1254
01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:45.185
But if we're not getting to the parents early enough,

1255
01:29:45.255 --> 01:29:47.865
then it gets harder I think, to get them to partner

1256
01:29:47.865 --> 01:29:49.745
with us when we're trying to do the work

1257
01:29:49.745 --> 01:29:51.065
that you're doing in these early years.

1258
01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:52.625
So I one ask would be

1259
01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:54.425
to actually add a little piece earlier on,

1260
01:29:54.955 --> 01:29:57.385
maybe it's just like why these community outreach pieces

1261
01:29:57.415 --> 01:29:59.065
that just said, Hey, you've got young kids,

1262
01:29:59.095 --> 01:30:00.185
like come and talk to us.

1263
01:30:00.235 --> 01:30:02.145
We'll help point you to resources

1264
01:30:02.145 --> 01:30:03.305
and give you some ideas or something.

1265
01:30:03.425 --> 01:30:04.545
'cause I think if we could start even earlier,

1266
01:30:04.765 --> 01:30:06.185
it doesn't have to be with us in the classroom,

1267
01:30:06.205 --> 01:30:08.545
but just to get the word out, it'd be great. Um,

1268
01:30:08.765 --> 01:30:10.025
I'd like to address that very briefly.

1269
01:30:10.175 --> 01:30:12.425
Sure. Um, I don't know, you might recall

1270
01:30:12.425 --> 01:30:14.625
that about a year ago I was here

1271
01:30:14.845 --> 01:30:18.105
and uh, did a presentation on the P three alignment work.

1272
01:30:18.125 --> 01:30:20.305
So preschool through three, uh, third grade,

1273
01:30:20.595 --> 01:30:25.065
there is a countywide um, initiative, uh, to align, uh,

1274
01:30:25.065 --> 01:30:26.545
what happens in preschool

1275
01:30:26.545 --> 01:30:28.065
through third grade for this very reason.

1276
01:30:28.485 --> 01:30:33.065
And there is a team of teachers, uh, preschool, TK one,

1277
01:30:33.485 --> 01:30:35.265
um, teachers, two, three teachers

1278
01:30:35.405 --> 01:30:37.785
and uh, G Young is on that task force with me.

1279
01:30:38.165 --> 01:30:39.625
One of our vision pieces.

1280
01:30:39.715 --> 01:30:42.185
There are only two pieces for our, uh, vision

1281
01:30:42.215 --> 01:30:44.665
with P three alignment work, uh, with this grant.

1282
01:30:45.085 --> 01:30:47.665
And one of them is to continue the letters training

1283
01:30:47.685 --> 01:30:49.185
and complete that with a hundred percent

1284
01:30:49.185 --> 01:30:50.625
of our teachers completing that.

1285
01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.785
But the second piece is the parent outreach.

1286
01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:56.185
Um, so we do know that's a piece that needs to be, uh,

1287
01:30:56.385 --> 01:30:57.545
a critical part of this work

1288
01:30:57.565 --> 01:31:00.625
and we do have, um, a plan to focus on that this year.

1289
01:31:00.725 --> 01:31:01.985
So you'll hear more about that.

1290
01:31:02.285 --> 01:31:03.425
That's Great. Thank you so much.

1291
01:31:03.485 --> 01:31:06.385
And um, a couple little points is that I know

1292
01:31:06.385 --> 01:31:07.945
with your pillars of literacy love the fact

1293
01:31:07.945 --> 01:31:09.385
that you've been able to diagram it

1294
01:31:09.385 --> 01:31:11.545
and codify it in such a clear way.

1295
01:31:12.085 --> 01:31:14.105
The one thing I would ask is that, as you mentioned

1296
01:31:14.105 --> 01:31:15.425
before, there are kids at all different levels,

1297
01:31:15.805 --> 01:31:18.265
but also there are kids that are very shy.

1298
01:31:18.685 --> 01:31:19.865
And I noticed that you have a lot

1299
01:31:19.865 --> 01:31:21.905
of these points in here about like reading out loud.

1300
01:31:22.045 --> 01:31:24.665
And so I presume that there's gonna be opportunities

1301
01:31:24.665 --> 01:31:26.625
to actually engage in students at the level of their comfort

1302
01:31:26.625 --> 01:31:28.305
with being in a classroom, presenting

1303
01:31:28.305 --> 01:31:30.145
and speaking out loud so that we don't,

1304
01:31:31.105 --> 01:31:32.265
'cause we want kids to love reading.

1305
01:31:32.365 --> 01:31:34.585
So thank you very much. Great presentation.

1306
01:31:37.155 --> 01:31:38.695
Any other questions? Alright, thank you.

1307
01:31:41.515 --> 01:31:44.375
And then it looks like there are two board policies related

1308
01:31:44.555 --> 01:31:48.415
to reading and language arts instruction that are just sort

1309
01:31:48.415 --> 01:31:53.215
of updating, updating language.

1310
01:31:53.605 --> 01:31:56.695
Correct. So, uh, this follows of course on the heels

1311
01:31:56.715 --> 01:31:57.895
of the presentation tonight.

1312
01:31:58.055 --> 01:31:59.565
'cause that makes a lot of sense. Um,

1313
01:31:59.625 --> 01:32:03.365
we have not updated our board policy on, um,

1314
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:06.045
reading instruction since 2007.

1315
01:32:06.425 --> 01:32:09.245
Um, there has been quite a bit of, uh, development in

1316
01:32:09.245 --> 01:32:10.525
that field as you heard this evening.

1317
01:32:10.865 --> 01:32:13.605
And so we're bringing to you, uh, some recommended updates

1318
01:32:13.605 --> 01:32:14.605
to our board policy

1319
01:32:14.665 --> 01:32:18.605
and administrative regulation, um, related to, uh, reading

1320
01:32:18.605 --> 01:32:19.965
and language arts instruction.

1321
01:32:20.345 --> 01:32:22.405
Um, the things I'd like to point out about this,

1322
01:32:22.585 --> 01:32:24.085
um, these revisions.

1323
01:32:24.465 --> 01:32:25.685
One is that we had quite a bit

1324
01:32:25.685 --> 01:32:29.565
of language in our old board policy that is, um,

1325
01:32:30.185 --> 01:32:32.965
no longer relevant it related to a specific program

1326
01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:33.965
that's not in place.

1327
01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:35.965
Um, and so we've removed that

1328
01:32:36.025 --> 01:32:37.805
and then there was some additional language

1329
01:32:37.805 --> 01:32:41.445
that was better suited to an ar, uh, than the board policy.

1330
01:32:41.665 --> 01:32:43.645
So we have, as we often do, uh,

1331
01:32:43.785 --> 01:32:48.125
or almost always do, uh, relied on the CSBA model language,

1332
01:32:48.425 --> 01:32:50.405
uh, for the board policy itself.

1333
01:32:50.785 --> 01:32:53.285
And then we have moved some of the language, um,

1334
01:32:53.285 --> 01:32:55.365
that was in our original board policy

1335
01:32:55.825 --> 01:32:57.485
to an administrative regulation.

1336
01:32:57.685 --> 01:33:00.685
CSBA does not have an administrative regulation recommended

1337
01:33:00.685 --> 01:33:02.645
for reading instruction, but we felt like

1338
01:33:02.645 --> 01:33:04.085
that would be, um, valuable.

1339
01:33:04.465 --> 01:33:06.085
And it, uh, just outlines

1340
01:33:06.085 --> 01:33:08.125
and clarifies what you heard this evening in terms of

1341
01:33:08.275 --> 01:33:10.925
what the focus of reading is for K through three and,

1342
01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:12.165
and, and then beyond.

1343
01:33:13.185 --> 01:33:14.845
And I'd be happy to take any questions

1344
01:33:15.105 --> 01:33:17.525
or the team will take some questions on reading

1345
01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:18.885
instruction. Trustee Blackman,

1346
01:33:19.325 --> 01:33:20.805
I dunno if this is related, but something

1347
01:33:20.805 --> 01:33:24.145
that's come up recently and if you're in the,

1348
01:33:24.175 --> 01:33:26.385
have kids in the right age group, maybe going

1349
01:33:26.385 --> 01:33:27.425
through schools now, it's just

1350
01:33:27.425 --> 01:33:28.505
a question that parents bring up.

1351
01:33:28.505 --> 01:33:30.065
And I don't know if it's related,

1352
01:33:30.065 --> 01:33:32.025
but maybe it is, um, cursive.

1353
01:33:32.935 --> 01:33:35.235
Um, it's one of those things that we sort of have lost.

1354
01:33:35.335 --> 01:33:37.555
And I think when students are trying to learn, not just

1355
01:33:37.555 --> 01:33:39.195
to read, but to express the ideas and thoughts

1356
01:33:39.195 --> 01:33:42.195
and put sentences together, is that anywhere, any place?

1357
01:33:42.255 --> 01:33:43.595
If they can pick up a pencil Yes.

1358
01:33:43.595 --> 01:33:45.355
And be able to do it would be great. So I didn't see it in

1359
01:33:45.355 --> 01:33:46.995
the document, but I'm hoping it's somewhere. Yes,

1360
01:33:47.185 --> 01:33:48.795
CURSIVE is part of the, um,

1361
01:33:49.995 --> 01:33:52.035
ELA standards, state standards.

1362
01:33:52.135 --> 01:33:53.875
Uh, it did sort of fall out of favor

1363
01:33:53.935 --> 01:33:56.515
and was probably not, um, practiced as often

1364
01:33:56.535 --> 01:33:58.555
as in the classroom maybe as it had been.

1365
01:33:58.815 --> 01:34:01.755
Um, in previous years. We did provide resources to teachers.

1366
01:34:01.855 --> 01:34:04.195
Was that last spring? Yes, last spring.

1367
01:34:04.575 --> 01:34:06.955
Um, to, to be sure that they were aware

1368
01:34:06.955 --> 01:34:09.755
that cursive is a part of the state standards

1369
01:34:09.935 --> 01:34:12.035
and that they had the resources to teach it

1370
01:34:12.035 --> 01:34:14.515
because it was not obvious, um, where

1371
01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.635
to find those resources in their adopted curriculum.

1372
01:34:17.025 --> 01:34:18.675
Okay. That's a great answer. So thank you.

1373
01:34:18.795 --> 01:34:19.915
'cause I wanna lead into the question.

1374
01:34:20.295 --> 01:34:22.515
So for that group that serve as in the hiccup

1375
01:34:22.585 --> 01:34:24.795
that got missed, are we doing anything

1376
01:34:24.795 --> 01:34:26.155
to catch those kids up?

1377
01:34:26.155 --> 01:34:28.395
Because I can just imagine like in 10,

1378
01:34:28.395 --> 01:34:30.035
20 years these kids are gonna be doctors

1379
01:34:30.095 --> 01:34:31.955
and they won't be able to write a scribbly scrawl

1380
01:34:31.955 --> 01:34:33.155
like, you know, prescription.

1381
01:34:33.155 --> 01:34:34.315
Maybe it'll all be digital then,

1382
01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:35.995
but there's a whole group

1383
01:34:35.995 --> 01:34:37.355
of students in our schools right now

1384
01:34:37.355 --> 01:34:39.355
that literally cannot read somebody else's

1385
01:34:39.355 --> 01:34:40.675
cursive, nevermind, write their own.

1386
01:34:41.335 --> 01:34:43.115
I'm not aware that we're doing any intervention

1387
01:34:43.135 --> 01:34:44.195
on cursive right now.

1388
01:34:44.505 --> 01:34:45.995
Does anybody wanna speak to that?

1389
01:34:46.535 --> 01:34:48.355
We will take that under advisement. Thank you.

1390
01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:53.475
Any other questions?

1391
01:34:53.685 --> 01:34:56.035
These are both, this is a first reading.

1392
01:34:56.035 --> 01:35:00.975
First reading as well. Okay. Alrightyy.

1393
01:35:00.975 --> 01:35:03.535
Well that brings us to consent already.

1394
01:35:03.995 --> 01:35:07.535
Um, which is L-K-L-M-N and O.

1395
01:35:07.795 --> 01:35:09.735
Is there anything, uh, trustee Cherrier,

1396
01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.125
you're gonna pull K two.

1397
01:35:15.985 --> 01:35:17.595
Yep, it's K two.

1398
01:35:19.045 --> 01:35:22.965
Staff would also like to poll, uh, O2

1399
01:35:23.225 --> 01:35:24.325
for information.

1400
01:35:24.325 --> 01:35:26.645
We have more information to provide the board on this topic.

1401
01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:30.725
Okay. Anything else? Trustee Blackman?

1402
01:35:32.305 --> 01:35:34.005
Um, pulling L one and L two.

1403
01:35:38.705 --> 01:35:39.285
Anyone else?

1404
01:35:43.935 --> 01:35:47.945
I'll take a motion to approve the consent minus K two,

1405
01:35:48.945 --> 01:35:50.545
L one, L two, and O2.

1406
01:35:51.735 --> 01:35:53.865
I'll move that we approve the consent calendar.

1407
01:35:54.305 --> 01:35:57.865
L, m, N and O minus L one, L two, and O2.

1408
01:36:00.475 --> 01:36:04.995
I'll second. Um, K is, it's the only K on there.

1409
01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:06.875
It's the only K. So I just excluded K from

1410
01:36:06.875 --> 01:36:07.875
My motion. I, I realize

1411
01:36:07.875 --> 01:36:10.295
what you did. Yep, it's okay.

1412
01:36:10.535 --> 01:36:12.745
K one is just saying it's the consent items.

1413
01:36:13.725 --> 01:36:16.305
Um, any other motions? Trustee? Press 20.

1414
01:36:17.475 --> 01:36:20.255
Aye. Everyone else? Aye. Aye. Aye.

1415
01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.055
Um, should we just start with K two real quick?

1416
01:36:25.245 --> 01:36:26.855
Take a motion to approve K two,

1417
01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:28.695
Uh, a move that we approve K two.

1418
01:36:29.045 --> 01:36:33.815
I'll second. Um, trustee pass. Aye. Everyone else? Aye.

1419
01:36:34.085 --> 01:36:37.225
Sustain four A's and an abstention.

1420
01:36:38.365 --> 01:36:40.145
Um, then we'll go to L one.

1421
01:36:42.545 --> 01:36:43.725
All right, thank you very much. Um,

1422
01:36:44.085 --> 01:36:45.565
I had actually requested,

1423
01:36:45.565 --> 01:36:46.805
and I really appreciate the fact

1424
01:36:46.805 --> 01:36:49.165
that staff had put together some, um,

1425
01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:50.965
ethnic studies, key terms.

1426
01:36:51.015 --> 01:36:52.605
There were a couple that were missing though,

1427
01:36:52.785 --> 01:36:54.285
so I think we need to follow up

1428
01:36:54.285 --> 01:36:56.085
and I am happy to provide that later on

1429
01:36:56.085 --> 01:36:58.005
that were in the document that didn't have definitions.

1430
01:36:58.465 --> 01:37:01.685
And I especially want to note that we use chat GPT

1431
01:37:01.685 --> 01:37:03.285
to do this, which is very interesting.

1432
01:37:03.865 --> 01:37:06.925
Um, the reason why I wanna pull this though was not just

1433
01:37:06.925 --> 01:37:09.925
to thank, but also to render, um, concern.

1434
01:37:10.765 --> 01:37:12.485
I know that some of what we've tried to do

1435
01:37:12.485 --> 01:37:16.765
with this course has been to, um, make itog in a way

1436
01:37:16.765 --> 01:37:18.485
so it fits within the requirements of the state.

1437
01:37:18.745 --> 01:37:22.245
But I noticed then analyzing the makeup of our community

1438
01:37:22.505 --> 01:37:25.205
and our student body, that we fall short in actually

1439
01:37:25.205 --> 01:37:27.805
aligning the course with who lives in our district.

1440
01:37:28.345 --> 01:37:30.285
Um, we have an extreme deficit

1441
01:37:30.585 --> 01:37:33.565
of material presented in the document that actually speaks

1442
01:37:33.625 --> 01:37:36.685
to the large of the East Asian community that exists here.

1443
01:37:37.065 --> 01:37:39.245
We also do not cover very much,

1444
01:37:39.605 --> 01:37:42.405
I don't think anything at all that I could see with regard

1445
01:37:42.405 --> 01:37:44.845
to, um, we have community members from the Middle East

1446
01:37:45.195 --> 01:37:46.285
that are here in our community

1447
01:37:46.285 --> 01:37:47.525
and there's nothing in it either.

1448
01:37:48.225 --> 01:37:51.125
Um, when we look at the demographics of the entire state

1449
01:37:51.125 --> 01:37:52.445
of California, you could argue

1450
01:37:52.475 --> 01:37:54.045
that there are many other groups

1451
01:37:54.045 --> 01:37:56.525
that should also be also be included or noted.

1452
01:37:56.945 --> 01:37:59.445
But what's most troubling for me is how we've sort

1453
01:37:59.445 --> 01:38:02.165
of taken the generic state information

1454
01:38:02.785 --> 01:38:04.125
and are very focused on it.

1455
01:38:04.125 --> 01:38:06.085
Even though in our own committee, some

1456
01:38:06.085 --> 01:38:07.525
of those groups we're gonna be talking about

1457
01:38:07.545 --> 01:38:10.485
and talking with and educating our students about, um,

1458
01:38:10.825 --> 01:38:12.565
are in such small numbers

1459
01:38:12.715 --> 01:38:15.445
that we could actually have a class with no one from

1460
01:38:15.445 --> 01:38:18.605
that group in it to discuss, represent, or to learn from.

1461
01:38:19.105 --> 01:38:20.365
So that was another concern.

1462
01:38:20.825 --> 01:38:23.085
So I found that it, there's this sort of misalignment

1463
01:38:23.155 --> 01:38:26.125
with the courses it's written with the community

1464
01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:27.405
that we live in, in our student body.

1465
01:38:27.785 --> 01:38:29.565
Um, I think some of the materials very interesting,

1466
01:38:29.565 --> 01:38:32.125
but I also think that we could have done a much better job

1467
01:38:32.125 --> 01:38:33.885
aligning it with our community, which is I think

1468
01:38:33.885 --> 01:38:35.205
what we were asked to do by the state.

1469
01:38:35.785 --> 01:38:37.405
Um, the other concerns I have were

1470
01:38:37.405 --> 01:38:39.085
that there was some information in here

1471
01:38:39.085 --> 01:38:40.725
that I don't think aligns with some of

1472
01:38:40.725 --> 01:38:42.485
what we should be teaching our students.

1473
01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:44.885
There's a lot of ideology pieces in here.

1474
01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:48.165
There's notations of some groups, I think actually are some

1475
01:38:48.165 --> 01:38:49.965
of the writings and reading material actually allude

1476
01:38:49.965 --> 01:38:53.765
to violent things, violent, um, historical incidents.

1477
01:38:53.765 --> 01:38:56.005
And I actually am concerned with how much we're using

1478
01:38:56.005 --> 01:38:58.125
that in the scope of what we're supposed to be doing

1479
01:38:58.125 --> 01:38:59.805
as an ethnic studies course.

1480
01:39:00.785 --> 01:39:02.205
So I went through a lot of information.

1481
01:39:02.305 --> 01:39:03.805
I'm not gonna be voting to approve this

1482
01:39:03.805 --> 01:39:05.605
because I think that we could have done a much better job

1483
01:39:05.605 --> 01:39:06.685
in aligning this with our community.

1484
01:39:06.685 --> 01:39:09.405
And I'm concerned that actually when we do have members

1485
01:39:09.405 --> 01:39:11.285
of the community showing up with their students

1486
01:39:11.305 --> 01:39:13.085
to take this course, there'll be a lot

1487
01:39:13.085 --> 01:39:14.245
of questions we'll have to answer.

1488
01:39:14.395 --> 01:39:16.405
Like, why didn't we include their kids in this?

1489
01:39:16.785 --> 01:39:18.525
And I appreciate that there'll be projects

1490
01:39:18.525 --> 01:39:22.965
and students can basically, um, find a way to, um, relate

1491
01:39:22.965 --> 01:39:24.085
to the context of the material

1492
01:39:24.225 --> 01:39:25.645
and present it, make it more their own.

1493
01:39:26.065 --> 01:39:28.485
But I'm also very concerned that given, um,

1494
01:39:28.515 --> 01:39:30.365
some other data sets of out of our census

1495
01:39:30.435 --> 01:39:33.045
that occurred in 2020, indicates that the majority

1496
01:39:33.045 --> 01:39:35.165
of the United States is moving towards more

1497
01:39:35.865 --> 01:39:38.445
two plus ethnicity and race designations.

1498
01:39:38.745 --> 01:39:40.485
And we have a lot of members of our community

1499
01:39:40.485 --> 01:39:42.965
that fall into those categories that cannot find a way

1500
01:39:42.965 --> 01:39:44.245
to actually marry

1501
01:39:44.265 --> 01:39:46.525
or meet with the way that the course is being run.

1502
01:39:47.145 --> 01:39:51.245
Um, 23 and Me does a really excellent job, a lot of analysis

1503
01:39:51.305 --> 01:39:55.405
and research on precisely how large that group actually is.

1504
01:39:55.665 --> 01:39:57.405
In fact, they indicate that most people

1505
01:39:57.415 --> 01:39:59.045
after they take the test, discover

1506
01:39:59.075 --> 01:40:00.565
that they have a much broader array

1507
01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:01.965
of their own personal background.

1508
01:40:01.965 --> 01:40:05.125
They don't realize. So I'm concerned about

1509
01:40:05.185 --> 01:40:07.165
how well the course is actually aligned with the reality

1510
01:40:07.165 --> 01:40:08.165
of our community and

1511
01:40:08.165 --> 01:40:11.605
how much it's educating them on their actual ethnic studies

1512
01:40:12.025 --> 01:40:14.925
and relevance in the United States when they may

1513
01:40:14.925 --> 01:40:16.085
not even know it themselves.

1514
01:40:16.185 --> 01:40:18.525
So I'm just gonna let you know I'm not voting for it

1515
01:40:18.525 --> 01:40:20.285
because I don't feel it really aligns with our community.

1516
01:40:20.725 --> 01:40:22.525
I would like us to take the next year

1517
01:40:22.535 --> 01:40:25.365
after the course wraps up and actually do a reboot

1518
01:40:25.585 --> 01:40:26.765
and to see how we can make it

1519
01:40:26.765 --> 01:40:27.925
align better with our own community.

1520
01:40:28.045 --> 01:40:29.565
I think we'd have a lot more interest in the course,

1521
01:40:29.705 --> 01:40:30.765
but I also think that our

1522
01:40:30.965 --> 01:40:32.085
outcomes would be better for our students.

1523
01:40:32.335 --> 01:40:33.335
Thank you.

1524
01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:38.345
Any other questions or comments?

1525
01:40:41.125 --> 01:40:43.725
I just wanna say I, I appreciated the presentation last time

1526
01:40:43.725 --> 01:40:47.725
that really focused on how they were using a more,

1527
01:40:50.335 --> 01:40:53.175
I can't think of the, the term kind comprehensive theme.

1528
01:40:53.795 --> 01:40:56.605
Yeah. Um, approach rather than the, the original core,

1529
01:40:56.835 --> 01:41:00.005
core four type, um, ethnic groups and doing that

1530
01:41:00.005 --> 01:41:01.605
and making it more of a broad based

1531
01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:06.525
and helping students to find themselves in the assignments,

1532
01:41:06.525 --> 01:41:09.285
help them, you know, view themselves and,

1533
01:41:09.305 --> 01:41:13.725
and really filter, filter learning, um, about themselves

1534
01:41:13.785 --> 01:41:16.325
and, and whatever their, their background might be.

1535
01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:19.725
Um, and I felt like that was really what we were looking

1536
01:41:19.785 --> 01:41:21.565
for is to not be kind of

1537
01:41:21.565 --> 01:41:23.965
what is traditionally considered a more,

1538
01:41:25.065 --> 01:41:27.505
I don't say old school 'cause it's not that old, um,

1539
01:41:27.505 --> 01:41:31.385
ethnic cities that just focuses on a few specific, um,

1540
01:41:31.445 --> 01:41:34.145
ethnic groups, but it that it focuses on more

1541
01:41:34.145 --> 01:41:37.955
of the concepts and the, the kind of history,

1542
01:41:38.295 --> 01:41:40.555
but through the lens across the board.

1543
01:41:41.175 --> 01:41:44.235
Um, and I thought that that was very well thought out.

1544
01:41:44.495 --> 01:41:47.495
Um, and there were some good questions, answers

1545
01:41:47.495 --> 01:41:48.855
to the questions that were, that were

1546
01:41:48.855 --> 01:41:50.255
brought up, um, last meeting.

1547
01:41:51.115 --> 01:41:53.255
Um, and I think that it, it it's able

1548
01:41:53.255 --> 01:41:54.695
to take the information and,

1549
01:41:54.695 --> 01:41:56.655
and bring it to, to all students.

1550
01:41:57.675 --> 01:42:01.735
Um, so I do, I do think that it, it answered a lot

1551
01:42:01.735 --> 01:42:02.895
of my questions regarding that.

1552
01:42:03.195 --> 01:42:07.805
Um, so I'll be supporting it. Um, trustee Speck?

1553
01:42:08.625 --> 01:42:09.965
Um, yeah, I'll echo.

1554
01:42:10.045 --> 01:42:13.685
I like the, the route that we took of focusing on, um,

1555
01:42:13.685 --> 01:42:16.685
different standards and not on the ethnicities.

1556
01:42:16.945 --> 01:42:19.445
Um, and I think you bring up a good point, um, that

1557
01:42:20.105 --> 01:42:23.165
we have many, um, families

1558
01:42:23.465 --> 01:42:25.285
of different races

1559
01:42:25.585 --> 01:42:30.165
and so you have, um, kids who don't identify with one,

1560
01:42:30.665 --> 01:42:32.285
um, specific ethnicity.

1561
01:42:32.385 --> 01:42:34.925
And so I think when you have a standard

1562
01:42:34.925 --> 01:42:37.445
around developing critical consciousness about race

1563
01:42:37.445 --> 01:42:40.165
and ethnicity and students analyzing interpreting

1564
01:42:40.685 --> 01:42:43.605
cultural products, it's not them saying

1565
01:42:43.855 --> 01:42:46.485
where they necessarily fit into one,

1566
01:42:46.505 --> 01:42:48.725
but they're looking at it in a broad scope.

1567
01:42:48.745 --> 01:42:49.765
And I think that's important

1568
01:42:49.765 --> 01:42:51.885
because our country is changing, um,

1569
01:42:51.945 --> 01:42:54.285
and we are becoming much, much more diverse.

1570
01:42:54.785 --> 01:42:57.845
Um, but not in just specific pockets,

1571
01:42:57.865 --> 01:42:59.765
but just, um, across the board

1572
01:42:59.765 --> 01:43:01.925
because you see this just mix of,

1573
01:43:02.505 --> 01:43:05.645
of people within families now that you didn't see

1574
01:43:05.865 --> 01:43:07.645
as much 20, 30 years ago.

1575
01:43:07.985 --> 01:43:11.165
Um, and so I think that this will allow the students to

1576
01:43:11.955 --> 01:43:13.165
find where they fit.

1577
01:43:13.625 --> 01:43:17.125
Um, I also don't agree that you need to have a child

1578
01:43:17.125 --> 01:43:19.165
of a certain race in the class to teach it.

1579
01:43:19.665 --> 01:43:23.805
Um, we do have a small or group of some ethnicities,

1580
01:43:23.805 --> 01:43:25.405
but it doesn't mean we wouldn't teach them.

1581
01:43:25.985 --> 01:43:29.605
Um, so, um, I think that they're all important,

1582
01:43:29.605 --> 01:43:31.765
whether it's a small group or a large group.

1583
01:43:32.145 --> 01:43:36.285
Um, I think it would be impossible to, um,

1584
01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:41.365
fit all of the different ethnicities in the world, um, into

1585
01:43:41.905 --> 01:43:43.165
the one semester class.

1586
01:43:43.745 --> 01:43:46.565
Um, so you'll understand that they do have to pick

1587
01:43:46.585 --> 01:43:48.045
and take, um, obviously the

1588
01:43:48.205 --> 01:43:49.285
guidance they get from the state.

1589
01:43:49.865 --> 01:43:51.845
Um, I think as it grows, um,

1590
01:43:52.145 --> 01:43:55.165
and as we get feedback from the kids who take it, um,

1591
01:43:55.365 --> 01:43:58.685
I could hope that the teachers will look to,

1592
01:43:59.225 --> 01:44:00.285
um, include more.

1593
01:44:00.465 --> 01:44:01.485
Um, I thought the answer

1594
01:44:01.545 --> 01:44:06.205
of the projects was a really good way that, um, a student

1595
01:44:06.265 --> 01:44:10.005
who might not see one aspect of their ethnicity

1596
01:44:10.065 --> 01:44:13.005
and what has been taught to do a project around that

1597
01:44:13.185 --> 01:44:15.725
and to, to teach the others in the class.

1598
01:44:15.745 --> 01:44:19.325
So I think that's a great way that, um, that can be shown.

1599
01:44:19.465 --> 01:44:22.565
So, um, I'm also comfortable in supporting this tonight.

1600
01:44:22.745 --> 01:44:25.365
Um, I think it will continue to grow, um,

1601
01:44:25.505 --> 01:44:28.085
and change as we get bigger groups.

1602
01:44:28.225 --> 01:44:29.485
It was obviously just a small group

1603
01:44:29.485 --> 01:44:30.925
that's fully taken at this point.

1604
01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:35.765
Um, so I'm excited to see where this curriculum goes as, um,

1605
01:44:35.995 --> 01:44:38.445
more teachers teach it and, um,

1606
01:44:39.105 --> 01:44:41.845
and we get a broader group that takes it and gives feedback.

1607
01:44:44.575 --> 01:44:46.785
Trustee chair, Thank you.

1608
01:44:47.285 --> 01:44:50.675
Um, I did hear what Trustee Blackman said and,

1609
01:44:51.095 --> 01:44:53.755
and Trustee Pelham and Trustee Spec.

1610
01:44:54.575 --> 01:44:58.355
Um, and also I was on the committee

1611
01:44:59.675 --> 01:45:03.275
whenever that was years ago that met several times

1612
01:45:03.535 --> 01:45:06.075
to develop the, the, the curriculum

1613
01:45:07.175 --> 01:45:10.035
and, you know, it wasn't a perfect process,

1614
01:45:10.615 --> 01:45:12.875
but there was a lot of effort put into it

1615
01:45:14.335 --> 01:45:17.955
and, um, you know, nothing,

1616
01:45:18.525 --> 01:45:20.435
especially something new is perfect.

1617
01:45:20.615 --> 01:45:25.315
Uh, you know, we've had relatively small numbers so far,

1618
01:45:26.415 --> 01:45:30.915
but, um, I, I agree with Trustee spec that it,

1619
01:45:30.915 --> 01:45:34.075
there's nothing in it preventing it from adapting

1620
01:45:34.615 --> 01:45:37.395
and growing and being more

1621
01:45:37.395 --> 01:45:39.755
and more inclusive, uh, as the

1622
01:45:40.605 --> 01:45:43.115
curriculum keeps uh, going.

1623
01:45:43.255 --> 01:45:44.835
So I, I am gonna support this.

1624
01:45:47.935 --> 01:45:49.315
Any other questions? Otherwise I'll take a

1625
01:45:49.315 --> 01:45:50.515
motion call for a vote.

1626
01:45:51.295 --> 01:45:53.345
I'll make a motion that we approve Item L one,

1627
01:45:53.345 --> 01:45:54.905
ethnic studies course one outline

1628
01:45:54.905 --> 01:45:56.025
and instructional materials.

1629
01:45:58.595 --> 01:46:03.235
I'll second Vote, I'll second. Okay.

1630
01:46:03.695 --> 01:46:05.995
We have a motion in a second. Uh, trustee Blackman,

1631
01:46:06.215 --> 01:46:07.835
I'm gonna make an, since this is probably gonna pass

1632
01:46:07.835 --> 01:46:11.235
anyways, I'm gonna be make an alternative motion, um,

1633
01:46:11.235 --> 01:46:12.995
since this is gonna pass to pass it,

1634
01:46:12.995 --> 01:46:15.715
but with an update to the grading policy to, um,

1635
01:46:16.115 --> 01:46:17.635
actually reflect the AR

1636
01:46:17.775 --> 01:46:19.395
and the board policy that was approved

1637
01:46:19.395 --> 01:46:20.395
by the board at this time.

1638
01:46:20.395 --> 01:46:21.395
It doesn't do that.

1639
01:46:26.345 --> 01:46:28.445
Can you point out where it does not in the homework

1640
01:46:28.445 --> 01:46:30.085
and grading policy on the course outline?

1641
01:46:32.335 --> 01:46:34.195
Second to last page, actually,

1642
01:46:34.255 --> 01:46:37.075
it doesn't provide at all the, um, grading scale

1643
01:46:37.075 --> 01:46:40.195
that is part of the ar it's missing from the document

1644
01:46:40.825 --> 01:46:42.125
and it doesn't make a reference to it,

1645
01:46:42.385 --> 01:46:43.725
but it includes something that's actually

1646
01:46:43.725 --> 01:46:45.005
not part of the grading scale. So

1647
01:46:45.245 --> 01:46:48.205
I see on grading policy site E it talks about

1648
01:46:48.815 --> 01:46:50.565
shava 10% range student score

1649
01:46:50.565 --> 01:46:54.725
below 50% in a given assignment, the reasonable attempt,

1650
01:46:54.725 --> 01:46:56.765
it'll be an m it looks like exact wordage from what

1651
01:46:56.765 --> 01:46:57.765
We've passed. The 10%

1652
01:46:57.765 --> 01:47:00.165
range is actually part of a paragraph designed

1653
01:47:00.165 --> 01:47:02.405
to explain why there's a 50% floor.

1654
01:47:02.435 --> 01:47:03.485
It's actually not part of the

1655
01:47:03.485 --> 01:47:04.805
scales that's provided in the ar.

1656
01:47:09.785 --> 01:47:11.195
Okay, well it's still an accurate statement.

1657
01:47:11.195 --> 01:47:12.955
We have a 10% range. So

1658
01:47:14.135 --> 01:47:15.875
Do we have a second for that amendment?

1659
01:47:20.415 --> 01:47:22.435
Not hearing one. I will take a call

1660
01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:25.275
for a vote on the original motion to prove, um,

1661
01:47:25.345 --> 01:47:26.395
this policy as written.

1662
01:47:26.395 --> 01:47:31.275
Trustee PEs 20. Aye. Everyone else? Aye. Aye. Aye. No, no.

1663
01:47:31.965 --> 01:47:33.185
Passes four to one.

1664
01:47:36.765 --> 01:47:39.465
And the next item was L two.

1665
01:47:44.645 --> 01:47:46.195
Thank you very much. So I pulled this item

1666
01:47:46.195 --> 01:47:49.435
because I had actually, um, expressed concerns with the lack

1667
01:47:49.435 --> 01:47:52.275
of information or detail in the Dublin Unified

1668
01:47:52.275 --> 01:47:53.755
School District dress code.

1669
01:47:54.295 --> 01:47:56.755
Um, there's just a lack of specificity.

1670
01:47:56.855 --> 01:47:59.675
It leaves it up to each site to determine

1671
01:47:59.905 --> 01:48:02.235
what actually defines appropriate attire.

1672
01:48:02.235 --> 01:48:06.195
And my concern at the time was that it makes it subjective

1673
01:48:06.255 --> 01:48:08.675
to any site administrator to make that definition.

1674
01:48:08.985 --> 01:48:10.315
Whereas if we actually

1675
01:48:10.715 --> 01:48:11.875
provided more specifics,

1676
01:48:11.935 --> 01:48:14.195
it would make it easier for our staff.

1677
01:48:14.295 --> 01:48:15.755
So I will not be voting on this

1678
01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.275
because it's actually not a code.

1679
01:48:17.275 --> 01:48:19.315
There's really not much of anything in here.

1680
01:48:22.715 --> 01:48:24.855
Any other, so So are you planning to abstain

1681
01:48:25.075 --> 01:48:26.655
or to, uh, no,

1682
01:48:27.155 --> 01:48:29.215
I'm not going to vote for it because it needs more detail.

1683
01:48:29.765 --> 01:48:32.055
Okay. All right. Any other comments?

1684
01:48:32.135 --> 01:48:33.135
Otherwise I'll take a motion.

1685
01:48:34.405 --> 01:48:36.015
I'll move. We approve item L two

1686
01:48:38.765 --> 01:48:39.765
I second.

1687
01:48:40.385 --> 01:48:44.815
Motion a second. Any other motions? Trustee? PE 20.

1688
01:48:45.475 --> 01:48:47.375
Aye. Everyone else? Aye.

1689
01:48:47.755 --> 01:48:50.055
Aye. No, Carries four to one

1690
01:48:52.065 --> 01:48:55.965
and then O2 I believe was a staff presentation.

1691
01:48:58.845 --> 01:49:00.945
Yes. We have further information, uh,

1692
01:49:01.015 --> 01:49:02.905
that we would provide like to provide

1693
01:49:02.975 --> 01:49:04.305
with this particular topic.

1694
01:49:04.445 --> 01:49:06.505
So Owen Fish, uh, will be coming up

1695
01:49:06.525 --> 01:49:08.265
and providing that information to the board.

1696
01:49:16.645 --> 01:49:19.555
Let's, There we go. Okay. Good evening.

1697
01:49:20.375 --> 01:49:22.475
Um, we wanted to provide some additional information

1698
01:49:22.475 --> 01:49:26.925
because earlier this evening I received a, um, bid protest

1699
01:49:27.905 --> 01:49:29.085
in relation to this item.

1700
01:49:29.825 --> 01:49:31.205
So I wanted to provide you some

1701
01:49:31.205 --> 01:49:32.445
background in relation to that.

1702
01:49:33.085 --> 01:49:35.785
Uh, bid protest. It was by one of the, it was

1703
01:49:35.785 --> 01:49:37.985
by Twining Consulting, who was one of the labs

1704
01:49:37.985 --> 01:49:41.385
that had submitted a proposal for the testing

1705
01:49:41.525 --> 01:49:44.135
and inspection for Shamrock Hills.

1706
01:49:45.275 --> 01:49:50.045
Um, we had an issue that arose during the bid

1707
01:49:50.845 --> 01:49:53.435
where the bid sheet that we had

1708
01:49:53.675 --> 01:49:58.155
provided to the, to the labs to use for providing their bid

1709
01:49:58.955 --> 01:50:02.095
was not specifically called out in the RFP

1710
01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:04.375
to be required to be used.

1711
01:50:05.075 --> 01:50:09.145
And so we had, um, one of the proposers

1712
01:50:09.145 --> 01:50:13.915
that submitted a bid that did not contain the bid sheet.

1713
01:50:14.835 --> 01:50:18.775
Um, I got a hold of that, that, uh, lab

1714
01:50:18.875 --> 01:50:20.695
and mentioned to them that they were missing one

1715
01:50:20.695 --> 01:50:22.375
of their documents within it.

1716
01:50:22.835 --> 01:50:26.415
And then he referenced back to me that that was not a,

1717
01:50:26.515 --> 01:50:28.535
an actual requirement in the RFP.

1718
01:50:28.935 --> 01:50:30.975
I went back and checked the documents and he was correct.

1719
01:50:32.075 --> 01:50:34.415
Um, so I got ahold of our legal counsel.

1720
01:50:35.005 --> 01:50:38.965
They recommended to reject all the bids

1721
01:50:38.965 --> 01:50:40.285
and put it immediately back out to bid.

1722
01:50:40.285 --> 01:50:42.725
Because this is a professional services contract,

1723
01:50:43.105 --> 01:50:45.005
it does not require that we meet all

1724
01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:46.685
of the same bid requirements that a

1725
01:50:47.205 --> 01:50:48.285
construction contract would.

1726
01:50:48.925 --> 01:50:51.385
And so their recommendation was just reject everything,

1727
01:50:52.455 --> 01:50:53.915
put it immediately back out to bid

1728
01:50:53.915 --> 01:50:55.835
and take it three, take the bids three days later,

1729
01:50:55.835 --> 01:50:59.075
since they would be the same pool of, um, people

1730
01:50:59.075 --> 01:51:02.515
that would be submitting for the RFP, which is what we did.

1731
01:51:03.135 --> 01:51:07.095
Um, in their proposal they mentioned we felt

1732
01:51:07.095 --> 01:51:09.655
that the district provided unclear and

1733
01:51:09.795 --> 01:51:13.415
or used vague dis uh, direction

1734
01:51:14.005 --> 01:51:17.175
make it an impossible for all submitters

1735
01:51:17.195 --> 01:51:19.055
to submissions to be reviewed equally.

1736
01:51:19.915 --> 01:51:23.985
And this was the reason which we did reject all bids

1737
01:51:23.985 --> 01:51:25.065
and then put it back out.

1738
01:51:25.065 --> 01:51:27.305
We felt like there was no way for us to

1739
01:51:28.105 --> 01:51:31.825
adequately compare the bids if we had two proposers

1740
01:51:31.825 --> 01:51:34.105
that used the form and two that did not use the form.

1741
01:51:34.915 --> 01:51:38.415
Um, so we rejected, required that form to be filled out,

1742
01:51:38.885 --> 01:51:40.055
took all the bids,

1743
01:51:40.055 --> 01:51:44.735
and then Joel Ross made the, the calculation of determining

1744
01:51:44.755 --> 01:51:48.215
who was the low, the best value

1745
01:51:48.235 --> 01:51:49.815
for the district in relation to the bid

1746
01:51:52.475 --> 01:51:53.475
Trustee chair.

1747
01:51:54.195 --> 01:51:57.475
Yeah, thank you. Um, I'll, uh,

1748
01:51:57.565 --> 01:52:00.955
admit I haven't had a chance to read the, um, attachment

1749
01:52:01.215 --> 01:52:04.355
to this, so forgive my questions if they're stupid.

1750
01:52:05.175 --> 01:52:09.355
Um, but on this evaluation sheet,

1751
01:52:09.475 --> 01:52:10.595
I it's not really a bid

1752
01:52:10.595 --> 01:52:12.235
because it's, it's professional services.

1753
01:52:12.495 --> 01:52:13.875
The, it's, it's a proposal. The

1754
01:52:13.875 --> 01:52:14.995
word bid should not be in here at all.

1755
01:52:15.215 --> 01:52:16.635
So, okay. Um,

1756
01:52:19.455 --> 01:52:22.795
did you supply the hours or We did, did not.

1757
01:52:22.795 --> 01:52:26.355
Or was it up to the testing lab to come up with the hours?

1758
01:52:27.415 --> 01:52:29.755
It was up to the testing lab based on their previous

1759
01:52:30.545 --> 01:52:32.475
experiences on similar type projects.

1760
01:52:33.475 --> 01:52:36.045
They provided the hours, but we did not use those hours.

1761
01:52:36.045 --> 01:52:37.325
We looked at what their rates were

1762
01:52:37.945 --> 01:52:40.045
and then the total number of hours that they

1763
01:52:40.555 --> 01:52:43.125
indicated it would take them to, um,

1764
01:52:43.905 --> 01:52:45.420
to accomplish each one of the tasks.

1765
01:52:45.545 --> 01:52:49.645
So we basically took our bid form aligned with DSA,

1766
01:52:49.645 --> 01:52:52.685
puts out a form 1 0 3 that has each one

1767
01:52:52.685 --> 01:52:56.005
of the individual requirements for inspection on a project.

1768
01:52:56.665 --> 01:52:59.125
We use that form to produce a bid form

1769
01:52:59.505 --> 01:53:01.645
and say these are the requirements for all the inspections,

1770
01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:05.045
provide the estimated hours, what your minimum number

1771
01:53:05.045 --> 01:53:07.085
of billing hours were and what the rate was.

1772
01:53:07.315 --> 01:53:08.565
Okay. So, and that would allow us

1773
01:53:08.585 --> 01:53:10.805
to make direct comparisons between the bidders

1774
01:53:10.995 --> 01:53:13.525
With, so, so you didn't compare hours to hours

1775
01:53:14.235 --> 01:53:16.965
because they have no control over the hours.

1776
01:53:17.425 --> 01:53:18.965
You know, they, they have absolutely none.

1777
01:53:18.965 --> 01:53:20.365
It's whenever they get called

1778
01:53:20.465 --> 01:53:22.285
by the project inspector to come out.

1779
01:53:22.465 --> 01:53:25.805
So even having hours in here I think is a

1780
01:53:26.085 --> 01:53:27.525
complete joke really.

1781
01:53:27.845 --> 01:53:30.845
I mean you need to look away at rates

1782
01:53:31.065 --> 01:53:35.395
and what their minimums are and and stuff like that

1783
01:53:35.395 --> 01:53:37.235
because the hour they have no control over the hours.

1784
01:53:37.235 --> 01:53:38.475
The hours or whatever the hours are.

1785
01:53:38.895 --> 01:53:40.795
Now, if one has a half day minimum,

1786
01:53:40.895 --> 01:53:43.275
one has a full day minimum, that's something to consider.

1787
01:53:43.735 --> 01:53:46.555
Yep. Uh, but as far as

1788
01:53:48.335 --> 01:53:49.835
if they come up with the hours,

1789
01:53:49.975 --> 01:53:53.795
and I don't think this is a valid valuation system, uh,

1790
01:53:53.795 --> 01:53:55.795
because you know, they just low ball the hours.

1791
01:53:56.535 --> 01:54:00.355
Um, and you know, if it goes over, they're gonna say, well,

1792
01:54:00.415 --> 01:54:02.715
hey, you want us, do you want the final report at the end?

1793
01:54:02.855 --> 01:54:04.355
You need to keep going out there.

1794
01:54:05.255 --> 01:54:08.505
Um, that, that's the first question.

1795
01:54:08.685 --> 01:54:12.465
The second question is, do you, as part of this process,

1796
01:54:12.965 --> 01:54:16.625
do you look at their, do you go online and look at their LEA

1797
01:54:16.625 --> 01:54:17.745
and make sure they're approved

1798
01:54:17.925 --> 01:54:20.705
for everything they are proposing on?

1799
01:54:21.005 --> 01:54:22.105
We did, there were two parts

1800
01:54:22.105 --> 01:54:23.505
of the proposal that they submitted.

1801
01:54:23.505 --> 01:54:25.025
One was their qualifications, which

1802
01:54:25.785 --> 01:54:28.025
provided, uh, the data in relation

1803
01:54:28.025 --> 01:54:29.745
to their approved lab status,

1804
01:54:30.575 --> 01:54:33.185
what the company status is, financials.

1805
01:54:33.565 --> 01:54:36.945
And then the second part was the proposal. Okay.

1806
01:54:37.005 --> 01:54:39.825
Um, I would say in relation to, while we don't

1807
01:54:40.625 --> 01:54:42.425
directly look at the total number of hours,

1808
01:54:43.085 --> 01:54:45.905
we looked at the billing, the billing increment

1809
01:54:45.905 --> 01:54:49.625
that they were billing and what they felt like the proposed,

1810
01:54:49.645 --> 01:54:51.865
we just kind of used an average of that to come up with,

1811
01:54:52.125 --> 01:54:53.145
here's what we felt like

1812
01:54:53.685 --> 01:54:55.505
for a budgetary number we would present

1813
01:54:55.505 --> 01:54:58.865
to the board in relation to a number for the project. Okay.

1814
01:54:58.865 --> 01:55:00.265
So its kind and we Realize that that changes.

1815
01:55:00.725 --> 01:55:01.945
It was kind so

1816
01:55:01.945 --> 01:55:04.425
that's why even further away from the word bid Yep.

1817
01:55:04.485 --> 01:55:06.025
It was kind of an evaluation process.

1818
01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:09.065
You verify their LEA status, make sure they were qualified

1819
01:55:09.065 --> 01:55:10.545
to do everything Yes.

1820
01:55:10.615 --> 01:55:15.545
They were supposed to do, then you looked at the,

1821
01:55:15.765 --> 01:55:17.225
the rates they were gonna use

1822
01:55:17.605 --> 01:55:21.065
and didn't strictly go by their hours to come up with a

1823
01:55:21.285 --> 01:55:22.285
Not strictly.

1824
01:55:22.685 --> 01:55:24.545
Ah, okay. So

1825
01:55:25.065 --> 01:55:26.705
I mean, and that's why I preface this with,

1826
01:55:26.935 --> 01:55:28.665
this is a professional services contract.

1827
01:55:28.695 --> 01:55:31.905
Yeah. Not a, what we would call nor a normal

1828
01:55:32.585 --> 01:55:33.585
Construction bid. So

1829
01:55:33.585 --> 01:55:36.785
the low numbered is not necessarily the best value

1830
01:55:36.785 --> 01:55:37.785
or the best qualified.

1831
01:55:37.785 --> 01:55:40.865
Correct. And I, I I just hate

1832
01:55:40.865 --> 01:55:42.625
to even use the word bid on this thing

1833
01:55:42.625 --> 01:55:45.565
because it has nothing to do with bid. So, so

1834
01:55:45.565 --> 01:55:46.565
Do I. Well that's why he

1835
01:55:46.565 --> 01:55:46.765
is not

1836
01:55:46.965 --> 01:55:48.045
recommending the lowest one. Yeah.

1837
01:55:48.825 --> 01:55:49.825
I'm So Yeah,

1838
01:55:49.825 --> 01:55:51.365
I didn't put it together entirely.

1839
01:55:51.525 --> 01:55:53.245
I would've structured things slightly different,

1840
01:55:53.265 --> 01:55:56.995
but, uh, I was the one that received the phone, you know,

1841
01:55:56.995 --> 01:55:58.915
the, the first bid when it came in and I looked at it

1842
01:55:58.935 --> 01:56:01.115
and I was like, Hey, they're missing some information here

1843
01:56:01.115 --> 01:56:02.235
that we really need Okay.

1844
01:56:02.235 --> 01:56:03.675
In order to make an evaluation of this.

1845
01:56:04.265 --> 01:56:06.305
Okay. Alright. Thank you

1846
01:56:07.485 --> 01:56:08.485
Trustee spec.

1847
01:56:08.715 --> 01:56:10.055
So the argument that

1848
01:56:10.075 --> 01:56:12.135
or whatever came in today was from Twining you said?

1849
01:56:12.135 --> 01:56:16.495
From Twining? Yes. Um, did they resubmit? They did. Okay.

1850
01:56:16.655 --> 01:56:18.215
'cause I mean, there is a number here. Yeah.

1851
01:56:18.315 --> 01:56:19.335
And but, but they felt

1852
01:56:19.335 --> 01:56:21.855
that they didn't have clarity on something.

1853
01:56:23.395 --> 01:56:26.455
No, they submitted correctly the first time along

1854
01:56:26.455 --> 01:56:28.535
with CTE is who were recommending.

1855
01:56:28.565 --> 01:56:31.175
They submitted it correctly the first time.

1856
01:56:31.725 --> 01:56:33.335
Okay. And so then when we redid it,

1857
01:56:33.335 --> 01:56:34.975
they just submitted the same thing three days

1858
01:56:34.975 --> 01:56:35.975
Later. Um, essentially,

1859
01:56:35.975 --> 01:56:36.935
I don't know.

1860
01:56:36.955 --> 01:56:39.335
No, I didn't look at, once I had discovered

1861
01:56:39.415 --> 01:56:40.495
that there was a mistake, I

1862
01:56:40.495 --> 01:56:41.575
didn't look at any more of the bids.

1863
01:56:41.615 --> 01:56:43.535
I just basically, I did see

1864
01:56:43.535 --> 01:56:47.015
that individuals did not submit the required document,

1865
01:56:47.425 --> 01:56:49.975
which is when I got ahold of legal counsel said,

1866
01:56:50.245 --> 01:56:51.375
what do we do in an instance?

1867
01:56:51.375 --> 01:56:52.695
What is the best course of action

1868
01:56:52.695 --> 01:56:53.935
forward in an instance like this?

1869
01:56:54.275 --> 01:56:57.295
And that was their recommendation was reject all the bids

1870
01:56:57.295 --> 01:56:59.215
and just rebid it three days later. And

1871
01:57:00.085 --> 01:57:01.085
Okay. And then

1872
01:57:01.085 --> 01:57:04.055
issue instructions specifically instructing them

1873
01:57:04.055 --> 01:57:05.255
to use the bid form provided.

1874
01:57:05.605 --> 01:57:08.095
Okay. Which is, and so when we re-put it out

1875
01:57:08.395 --> 01:57:09.575
and gave the three days later,

1876
01:57:09.795 --> 01:57:12.215
did you feel like we were clear in what we asked for?

1877
01:57:12.875 --> 01:57:17.815
And we did, did the four bids that came back have all pieces

1878
01:57:17.915 --> 01:57:19.775
of information Yes. That we asked for?

1879
01:57:20.765 --> 01:57:23.735
They did. Some of them didn't follow exactly

1880
01:57:23.845 --> 01:57:25.615
what it was called out.

1881
01:57:25.615 --> 01:57:27.055
Okay. Because we asked for each line item.

1882
01:57:27.405 --> 01:57:31.215
Some of them indicated this line item included in the line

1883
01:57:31.215 --> 01:57:34.375
item above at which didn't really break it down the way we

1884
01:57:34.615 --> 01:57:37.215
wanted it, but it was still in such fashion

1885
01:57:37.215 --> 01:57:40.475
that it allowed us to, to come up with a,

1886
01:57:40.895 --> 01:57:41.915
uh, best value for the

1887
01:57:42.035 --> 01:57:43.035
District. Okay. And then for the

1888
01:57:43.035 --> 01:57:45.235
two that were the highest va, um,

1889
01:57:45.295 --> 01:57:47.515
priced ones, I assume we also looked down at the

1890
01:57:47.535 --> 01:57:48.915
hourly rate We did.

1891
01:57:48.935 --> 01:57:50.195
Um, and they were then higher

1892
01:57:50.195 --> 01:57:52.275
than the one you're recommending. CTE cal.

1893
01:57:52.815 --> 01:57:55.355
Uh, there, there was one RMA

1894
01:57:55.355 --> 01:57:58.635
for instance had maybe a lower hourly rate on a couple

1895
01:57:58.635 --> 01:57:59.755
of the items that they had.

1896
01:58:00.225 --> 01:58:02.555
Some of the other rates were higher, but Sure.

1897
01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:04.155
So you have to do an average in the overall evaluation.

1898
01:58:04.155 --> 01:58:07.275
We felt like CTE had the better value to the district,

1899
01:58:07.375 --> 01:58:09.115
better price to the district on the Okay.

1900
01:58:09.135 --> 01:58:11.555
And for the other two, whatever the average

1901
01:58:11.615 --> 01:58:13.715
of theirs you felt was higher than

1902
01:58:14.135 --> 01:58:16.315
One of the other bidders submitted it a minute late.

1903
01:58:16.865 --> 01:58:19.475
Yeah, so I had, I didn't even evaluate that proposal.

1904
01:58:19.905 --> 01:58:22.155
Okay. But the other two that were higher, we,

1905
01:58:22.255 --> 01:58:24.595
we evaluated, we, we felt like when we looked at their

1906
01:58:24.595 --> 01:58:26.035
average daily Yep.

1907
01:58:26.095 --> 01:58:29.395
Or average rate, it was higher than CTE. Yes. Correct.

1908
01:58:31.685 --> 01:58:32.685
Trustee chair.

1909
01:58:33.565 --> 01:58:35.815
Yeah. Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but, um,

1910
01:58:36.885 --> 01:58:39.265
but do you also look at the minimums

1911
01:58:39.325 --> 01:58:40.465
for picking up the samples?

1912
01:58:40.615 --> 01:58:44.405
Because if that's also the same half day, one day minimums,

1913
01:58:44.405 --> 01:58:46.485
that, that can add up pretty quickly.

1914
01:58:46.885 --> 01:58:50.085
Normally it's like a much smaller minimum for that one task.

1915
01:58:50.865 --> 01:58:52.525
Yes. Okay, great. We did look at that.

1916
01:58:55.095 --> 01:58:55.915
All right. Any other questions?

1917
01:58:55.915 --> 01:58:56.635
Otherwise I'll take a motion.

1918
01:58:58.605 --> 01:59:00.495
I'll move that We approve item oh two,

1919
01:59:01.325 --> 01:59:02.325
I'll second. Alright.

1920
01:59:02.325 --> 01:59:05.575
Any motion trustee wan? Aye. Everyone else?

1921
01:59:05.955 --> 01:59:09.815
Aye, aye, aye. Motion carries unanimously. All right.

1922
01:59:09.925 --> 01:59:14.295
That brings us to, we have no written reports for tonight.

1923
01:59:15.435 --> 01:59:17.015
Um, future items.

1924
01:59:21.475 --> 01:59:24.575
So the next board meeting is our data walk.

1925
01:59:24.835 --> 01:59:28.775
Uh, that will be the primary, um, um,

1926
01:59:29.615 --> 01:59:32.495
presentation, but we will have a couple other items.

1927
01:59:32.955 --> 01:59:35.335
Uh, one will be a layout

1928
01:59:35.715 --> 01:59:38.615
and presentation for the fencing at,

1929
01:59:38.955 --> 01:59:40.895
um, uh, Dublin High.

1930
01:59:40.895 --> 01:59:43.375
We have not received the bids back in time for this one, so

1931
01:59:43.375 --> 01:59:44.935
that will come back in December.

1932
01:59:45.075 --> 01:59:48.095
But we at least want to, uh, share the plan for the board.

1933
01:59:48.835 --> 01:59:53.095
Um, and then I hope to have a letter of engagement from, uh,

1934
01:59:53.095 --> 01:59:56.935
the city to, for the board to accept regarding, uh,

1935
01:59:57.115 --> 02:00:00.215
the field use at Fallon Sports Park for Emerald High

1936
02:00:00.355 --> 02:00:02.015
for softball and baseball.

1937
02:00:02.555 --> 02:00:05.215
And our contribution, uh, to support

1938
02:00:05.475 --> 02:00:09.135
and resurface some of the fields, uh, the city fields for,

1939
02:00:09.395 --> 02:00:10.855
uh, Dublin Little League.

1940
02:00:13.125 --> 02:00:17.095
Trustee chair, Just a question for Superintendent Funk.

1941
02:00:17.195 --> 02:00:21.535
Uh, has the board taken action, I can't remember, uh, on,

1942
02:00:21.755 --> 02:00:25.095
uh, wanting the fencing prior

1943
02:00:25.235 --> 02:00:27.135
to getting the proposals?

1944
02:00:27.315 --> 02:00:29.695
The board has not taken action on, uh,

1945
02:00:29.825 --> 02:00:31.815
staff getting proposals. No. Okay.

1946
02:00:32.295 --> 02:00:36.455
I just, Ms Technically I'm against fencing in the first

1947
02:00:36.455 --> 02:00:37.855
place, so that's, that's a whole

1948
02:00:38.015 --> 02:00:39.135
separate issue though, but, okay.

1949
02:00:39.135 --> 02:00:40.135
Thank you

1950
02:00:40.975 --> 02:00:42.025
Trustee Blackman.

1951
02:00:42.735 --> 02:00:44.595
So I'd like to make a request, um,

1952
02:00:44.945 --> 02:00:47.875
because of where we are in the school year schedule

1953
02:00:48.575 --> 02:00:51.355
for a special meeting for the board to address enforcement

1954
02:00:51.355 --> 02:00:52.555
of our grading policy

1955
02:00:52.975 --> 02:00:56.235
and ar um, we have an issue

1956
02:00:56.345 --> 02:00:58.475
that has occurred at Emerald High School,

1957
02:00:59.095 --> 02:01:01.795
and I'm concerned that it involves hundreds of students

1958
02:01:02.095 --> 02:01:03.475
and the fact that our policy

1959
02:01:03.575 --> 02:01:04.955
and ar were not enforced,

1960
02:01:04.955 --> 02:01:07.915
that we actually may be placed ourselves in a liability

1961
02:01:08.395 --> 02:01:11.115
situation should they form any kind of legal, um,

1962
02:01:11.295 --> 02:01:13.915
action be taken to rectify the situation.

1963
02:01:13.975 --> 02:01:15.875
So if we can do it in a special meeting

1964
02:01:16.375 --> 02:01:17.595
in the next two days, that'd be great.

1965
02:01:17.615 --> 02:01:19.235
If we can accomplish it, it would have

1966
02:01:19.235 --> 02:01:20.915
to be an action item for the November meeting.

1967
02:01:21.045 --> 02:01:22.045
Thank you.

1968
02:01:29.185 --> 02:01:30.565
So I don't think we're gonna be getting a meeting,

1969
02:01:31.855 --> 02:01:33.015
anything scheduled in the next couple days,

1970
02:01:33.275 --> 02:01:37.115
but, um, I know we'll meet soon this week

1971
02:01:37.115 --> 02:01:41.105
and we can look at, at timing on potential options and,

1972
02:01:41.105 --> 02:01:42.145
and see what we come up with.

1973
02:01:43.325 --> 02:01:46.025
Um, anything else anyone has

1974
02:01:46.655 --> 02:01:48.705
otherwise I'll do Trustee Reports.

1975
02:01:49.015 --> 02:01:50.015
Trustee Spec?

1976
02:01:51.735 --> 02:01:55.425
Sure. Um, last week we had a safety committee meeting, um,

1977
02:01:55.525 --> 02:01:59.385
and we heard a presentation about a program that, um,

1978
02:01:59.815 --> 02:02:01.545
digitizes campus and, um,

1979
02:02:01.545 --> 02:02:03.825
essentially makes it a lot easier for first responders.

1980
02:02:04.285 --> 02:02:06.425
Um, it ran the whole time, so we didn't have the time

1981
02:02:06.425 --> 02:02:07.585
to talk about it yet,

1982
02:02:07.605 --> 02:02:09.785
but, um, we'll be interested to, um,

1983
02:02:09.785 --> 02:02:11.425
discuss it more the next time we meet.

1984
02:02:12.005 --> 02:02:16.225
Um, from an ROP standpoint, um, they, um,

1985
02:02:16.285 --> 02:02:19.865
our Tri-Valley, um, ROP hosted a delegation from the state,

1986
02:02:20.285 --> 02:02:22.305
um, with representatives from the governor's office,

1987
02:02:22.565 --> 02:02:25.225
the Department of Finance, the set senate committees,

1988
02:02:25.245 --> 02:02:26.825
and the legislative analyst office.

1989
02:02:27.325 --> 02:02:30.065
Um, this is something to be very proud of, that we are part

1990
02:02:30.065 --> 02:02:31.265
of this Tri-Valley, ROP.

1991
02:02:31.685 --> 02:02:35.505
Um, the state is wanting

1992
02:02:35.685 --> 02:02:37.825
to learn more about ROPs.

1993
02:02:37.825 --> 02:02:39.785
They're not super educated on them,

1994
02:02:40.045 --> 02:02:43.025
and they chose, um, our Tri-Valley, ROP

1995
02:02:43.025 --> 02:02:45.225
and the Eden ROP, to come and view.

1996
02:02:45.445 --> 02:02:47.185
So, um, uh,

1997
02:02:47.185 --> 02:02:49.025
and a lot of that is due to the advocacy

1998
02:02:49.025 --> 02:02:52.665
that our Tri-Valley ROP, um, has had with the state.

1999
02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:56.985
Um, so, um, just great job

2000
02:02:57.085 --> 02:02:58.345
to Julie and her staff.

2001
02:02:58.525 --> 02:03:00.785
Um, and the visit went really well.

2002
02:03:01.165 --> 02:03:04.505
Um, I was told as well as it as they could have expected it

2003
02:03:04.505 --> 02:03:06.545
to go, so I'm really excited for them

2004
02:03:06.565 --> 02:03:08.145
and everything they've done, um,

2005
02:03:08.325 --> 02:03:10.505
and an opportunity to highlight all of

2006
02:03:10.505 --> 02:03:11.945
that great work to the state.

2007
02:03:12.565 --> 02:03:14.305
Um, they also hosted the college

2008
02:03:14.365 --> 02:03:17.345
and career fair that was at Dublin High last night.

2009
02:03:17.805 --> 02:03:21.105
Um, so I was able to go by and it was very well attended.

2010
02:03:21.325 --> 02:03:25.305
Um, lots of families, lots of parents, lots of students, um,

2011
02:03:25.525 --> 02:03:27.705
and a wide variety of colleges.

2012
02:03:28.085 --> 02:03:30.665
Um, a lot of them, obviously California, um,

2013
02:03:30.665 --> 02:03:32.465
but then also a lot from other states.

2014
02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:36.665
And, um, just saw lots of families with Big Stacks, um,

2015
02:03:37.105 --> 02:03:38.105
learning about colleges.

2016
02:03:38.105 --> 02:03:40.265
So great to have that, um, for our students.

2017
02:03:41.125 --> 02:03:43.905
Um, I was able to be part of a lot

2018
02:03:43.905 --> 02:03:46.385
of the homecoming activities last week at Dublin High.

2019
02:03:46.845 --> 02:03:48.745
Um, loved seeing the area builds.

2020
02:03:48.965 --> 02:03:50.065
Um, it was my first time

2021
02:03:50.065 --> 02:03:51.945
to ever see an area build, so that was a lot of fun.

2022
02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.225
Um, enjoyed watching two

2023
02:03:54.225 --> 02:03:56.985
of our trustees be the Grand Marshals in the parade.

2024
02:03:57.805 --> 02:04:00.625
And, um, and then attending the football game, um,

2025
02:04:00.725 --> 02:04:02.985
and seeing all of our cheerleaders football team

2026
02:04:02.985 --> 02:04:05.305
and band, um, and the very excited student section.

2027
02:04:06.165 --> 02:04:08.985
Um, I was able to attend the groundbreaking

2028
02:04:09.125 --> 02:04:12.585
for our new Shamrock K eight Shamrock Hills K eight site,

2029
02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:15.225
um, last week with most of my trustees here.

2030
02:04:15.885 --> 02:04:19.385
And then just wanna finish by recognizing, um, uh,

2031
02:04:19.615 --> 02:04:22.785
over the last three weeks we've had, um, two deaths

2032
02:04:22.925 --> 02:04:25.305
of staff members and, um,

2033
02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:27.705
that has been very difficult for our community.

2034
02:04:28.165 --> 02:04:31.025
Um, I did attend the candlelight memorial at

2035
02:04:31.045 --> 02:04:32.265
Dublin l for Mr.

2036
02:04:32.315 --> 02:04:35.665
Rocky. Um, I knew him personally being a volunteer there,

2037
02:04:35.805 --> 02:04:38.165
and, um, he's a great, great man.

2038
02:04:38.185 --> 02:04:40.965
And, um, I think that the memorial was, um, very well done,

2039
02:04:41.465 --> 02:04:43.925
um, and was just happy to be there with the community to,

2040
02:04:43.945 --> 02:04:46.045
um, remember everything he's done for that school.

2041
02:04:48.355 --> 02:04:49.945
Thank you Trustee Blackman. Thank you.

2042
02:04:49.945 --> 02:04:51.545
Just an update this past, uh, week,

2043
02:04:51.545 --> 02:04:53.025
we actually had a budget committee meeting,

2044
02:04:53.125 --> 02:04:55.105
so I wanna thank everybody who attended the meeting.

2045
02:04:55.145 --> 02:04:56.545
I wanna thank Chris Hobbs,

2046
02:04:56.545 --> 02:04:58.265
who did a great job walking everyone through

2047
02:04:58.605 --> 02:05:00.745
and all the suggestions I think were really wonderful.

2048
02:05:01.005 --> 02:05:02.985
Um, with, especially when we're asking

2049
02:05:03.005 --> 02:05:04.425
for community feedback, there needs

2050
02:05:04.425 --> 02:05:05.985
to be a little bit more education on some

2051
02:05:05.985 --> 02:05:08.465
of the various pieces and components since our community is

2052
02:05:08.465 --> 02:05:09.985
not familiar, for example, with tosa.

2053
02:05:10.405 --> 02:05:12.745
So those need to be sort of disaggregated so

2054
02:05:12.745 --> 02:05:13.905
that everybody can understand the value

2055
02:05:13.905 --> 02:05:15.465
of each section and put it together.

2056
02:05:15.885 --> 02:05:17.905
Um, I think there was a lot of collaborative ideas,

2057
02:05:18.015 --> 02:05:20.425
some suggestions, um, that were brought up

2058
02:05:20.525 --> 02:05:21.985
and we still have a long way to go.

2059
02:05:22.045 --> 02:05:25.385
And so if you're listening tonight, I please would ask you

2060
02:05:25.525 --> 02:05:28.905
to engage in this information and to send some feedback

2061
02:05:28.905 --> 02:05:30.465
because what you value

2062
02:05:30.645 --> 02:05:32.785
for your students in the district is really important.

2063
02:05:33.445 --> 02:05:35.785
And I will comment that there does seem to be a little bit

2064
02:05:35.785 --> 02:05:37.345
of a shearing between staff

2065
02:05:37.405 --> 02:05:39.505
and community in terms of what everybody prefers.

2066
02:05:39.525 --> 02:05:41.865
So it's gonna be challenging to find, thread the needle

2067
02:05:41.885 --> 02:05:44.385
and figure out exactly how to make it work for everybody.

2068
02:05:44.485 --> 02:05:46.625
But the more feedback that the committee has

2069
02:05:46.645 --> 02:05:47.705
and the board has, the better.

2070
02:05:47.725 --> 02:05:50.825
So thank you very much for contributing to date,

2071
02:05:50.845 --> 02:05:52.185
but we look forward to more feedback.

2072
02:05:52.625 --> 02:05:54.385
I also attended the college and career fair,

2073
02:05:54.385 --> 02:05:55.745
and I think it was crazy busy

2074
02:05:56.125 --> 02:05:58.985
and really super packed, so I love that the, uh,

2075
02:05:58.985 --> 02:06:01.985
school did it and obviously ROP and others contributing.

2076
02:06:02.245 --> 02:06:05.185
The one thing I would actually, um, request though,

2077
02:06:05.185 --> 02:06:07.745
however, is that I think that the setup needs to be done so

2078
02:06:07.745 --> 02:06:09.945
that there's more time for more people to actually engage

2079
02:06:10.105 --> 02:06:11.905
with individual colleges, um,

2080
02:06:11.905 --> 02:06:13.545
because the lines were incredibly long

2081
02:06:13.545 --> 02:06:15.065
and many of the families and students were

2082
02:06:15.065 --> 02:06:16.265
very frustrated, given the hour.

2083
02:06:16.445 --> 02:06:18.065
So I love that it got started.

2084
02:06:18.185 --> 02:06:19.265
I love that there were so many

2085
02:06:19.265 --> 02:06:20.265
that showed up from all over

2086
02:06:20.265 --> 02:06:21.305
the country that was really amazing.

2087
02:06:21.485 --> 02:06:23.785
So, and our students, I think got a lot out of it.

2088
02:06:23.845 --> 02:06:24.845
So thank you

2089
02:06:26.185 --> 02:06:27.765
You Trustee chair, uh,

2090
02:06:27.765 --> 02:06:28.765
No report tonight.

2091
02:06:28.895 --> 02:06:33.045
Chris e Cole. I just want to add to the reports that,

2092
02:06:33.225 --> 02:06:36.565
uh, the tech committee has started meeting again and, uh,

2093
02:06:36.565 --> 02:06:40.125
after getting an AI policy in place as well

2094
02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:41.845
as cell phone policy, you think will be done.

2095
02:06:42.385 --> 02:06:44.045
But, uh, we're, we're gonna chase

2096
02:06:44.045 --> 02:06:48.885
after the, the network speed issues at DHS.

2097
02:06:48.985 --> 02:06:50.645
So that's something that's on the, on,

2098
02:06:51.585 --> 02:06:52.965
on a table for asis saw.

2099
02:06:53.025 --> 02:06:54.025
That's it.

2100
02:06:55.325 --> 02:06:57.705
All righty. Thank you. Um, I had the opportunity

2101
02:06:57.705 --> 02:07:00.905
to attend a lot of the homecoming events, um, skit night,

2102
02:07:01.645 --> 02:07:03.265
um, the parade, um,

2103
02:07:03.265 --> 02:07:05.665
which appreciated being in involved with.

2104
02:07:05.845 --> 02:07:08.945
Um, I really, I really do wanna acknowledge

2105
02:07:08.945 --> 02:07:11.945
and appreciate, um, how many schools came.

2106
02:07:12.165 --> 02:07:14.305
It was great to still see Fallon and Cottonwood

2107
02:07:14.525 --> 02:07:17.185
and a lot of the East side elementaries participate in it.

2108
02:07:17.645 --> 02:07:20.825
Um, it's been, I I literally live right by the parade route

2109
02:07:20.845 --> 02:07:22.945
and have been going there for 20 plus years.

2110
02:07:23.165 --> 02:07:26.945
And I do, I love that the community vi feel to it.

2111
02:07:27.605 --> 02:07:30.225
Um, and so I do appreciate all, all of the people

2112
02:07:30.225 --> 02:07:31.505
that made the effort to come over.

2113
02:07:31.665 --> 02:07:35.245
I hope they had a good time, um, be able

2114
02:07:35.245 --> 02:07:37.005
to attend the Homecoming game as well.

2115
02:07:37.665 --> 02:07:40.965
Um, one other thing I would like to, um, kind of commend,

2116
02:07:41.105 --> 02:07:43.045
uh, leadership and everything is,

2117
02:07:43.465 --> 02:07:46.165
and one of the great traditions I feel like is that

2118
02:07:46.785 --> 02:07:49.485
before homecoming pictures over at Heritage, there's a lot

2119
02:07:49.485 --> 02:07:51.885
of schools around here that it's at somebody's house

2120
02:07:52.145 --> 02:07:54.605
by the class and it, it feels very exclusive,

2121
02:07:54.955 --> 02:07:58.325
whereas the Heritage Group feels very, very inclusive

2122
02:07:58.505 --> 02:07:59.685
and anybody can show up.

2123
02:08:00.185 --> 02:08:01.845
You see kids that you've known since they

2124
02:08:01.845 --> 02:08:02.925
were barely walking.

2125
02:08:03.185 --> 02:08:05.365
Um, and some people it's just too much and they don't come

2126
02:08:05.365 --> 02:08:06.925
and they meet elsewhere and that's great.

2127
02:08:07.385 --> 02:08:08.485
But I appreciated that.

2128
02:08:08.545 --> 02:08:12.325
Um, the Dudley Group put out the time, the date everywhere

2129
02:08:12.345 --> 02:08:14.445
to everyone, um, and that everyone's invited.

2130
02:08:14.545 --> 02:08:18.165
So I, I really wanna commend the group for that so

2131
02:08:18.165 --> 02:08:21.625
that we can, you know, find your friends, you know,

2132
02:08:22.085 --> 02:08:23.265
we parents enjoy it as well,

2133
02:08:23.265 --> 02:08:24.465
seeing everybody all dressed up.

2134
02:08:24.565 --> 02:08:27.185
So, um, um, commend that I was also able

2135
02:08:27.185 --> 02:08:30.585
to hand do the Shamrock Hills, um, groundbreaking

2136
02:08:30.765 --> 02:08:32.745
and also just wanna congratulate, um,

2137
02:08:32.825 --> 02:08:34.185
I know our senior nights are starting

2138
02:08:34.185 --> 02:08:37.065
for all our fall sports, so congratulate, um, all

2139
02:08:37.065 --> 02:08:41.145
of the seniors for girls tennis, football, girls volleyball,

2140
02:08:42.825 --> 02:08:44.935
cross country water polo.

2141
02:08:45.145 --> 02:08:47.565
Sorry, I'm missing something, but, um,

2142
02:08:48.105 --> 02:08:49.605
congratulations on that.

2143
02:08:50.505 --> 02:08:55.015
Um, and then I will, um, ask at the end that we do, um,

2144
02:08:55.165 --> 02:08:56.255
adjourn our meeting in memory

2145
02:08:56.255 --> 02:08:57.775
of the two staff members that we have lost.

2146
02:08:57.995 --> 02:09:00.415
Um, so I'll bring that up at the end as well.

2147
02:09:00.675 --> 02:09:03.815
But, um, yes, it's been a very difficult time, um,

2148
02:09:03.815 --> 02:09:06.135
and I believe more information will be coming out, um, from

2149
02:09:06.835 --> 02:09:09.255
uh, Memorial with the Murray community.

2150
02:09:09.995 --> 02:09:11.215
Um, so that's it for tonight.

2151
02:09:12.485 --> 02:09:13.625
So I will pass and,

2152
02:09:13.765 --> 02:09:15.545
and give my time for a moment of silence.

2153
02:09:32.495 --> 02:09:33.495
Thank you.

2154
02:09:36.765 --> 02:09:38.545
So we will then I will ask

2155
02:09:38.545 --> 02:09:40.185
for a motion if we could adjourn the memory

2156
02:09:40.285 --> 02:09:41.665

2157
02:09:42.205 --> 02:09:45.185
and Rocky Orman, both staff members that we lost, um,

2158
02:09:45.185 --> 02:09:46.385
from our community recently.

2159
02:09:49.085 --> 02:09:51.615
I'll move that we adjourn, um, in memory

2160
02:09:51.755 --> 02:09:54.335

2161
