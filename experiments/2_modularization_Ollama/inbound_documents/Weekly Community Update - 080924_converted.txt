DUSD
Community,
The
Local
Control
and
Accountability
Plan
(LCAP)
is
a
vital
part
of
our
educational
planning
and
funding 
process.
This
three-year
plan
outlines
our
goals
for
student
achievement
and
the
speciﬁc
actions
we
will
take 
to
achieve
those
goals.
The
LCAP
also
addresses
how
funds
will
be
allocated
to
support
students
with
the 
greatest
needs.
It
is
important
for
our
community
to
understand
the
LCAP
because
it
directly
impacts
the
resources
and 
programs
that
we
will
be
able
to
provide
to
our
students.
By
being
informed
about
the
LCAP,
you
can
help
us 
in
ensuring
that
our
educational
objectives
reﬂect
the
needs
and
priorities
of
our
students,
families,
and 
community.
The
Dublin
Uniﬁed
School
District's
LCAP
for
2024-2027
is
available
for
review
on
our
website
.
We
have
the 
full
95-page
LCAP
and
a
two-page
overview.
I
encourage
you
to
review
the
plan.
In
other
news,
I
look
forward
to
seeing
schools
full
of
students
and
staff
next
week.
We
are
so
excited
to
have 
everyone
back
and
to
begin
another
phenomenal
school
year.
Sincerely,
Chris
D.
