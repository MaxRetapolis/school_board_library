I'll assist you in creating an ontology-based entity index from the provided document.

**Ontology Expert Mode Activation**

To begin, I need to understand the predefined ontology for the School Board New Member Copilot. The ontology includes entities such as:

* Events
* People
* Organizations
* Documents
* Resources

The ontology also defines relationships between these entities, including:
* Event → Category (e.g., Meeting, Vote, Policy Update)
* Person → Role (e.g., Chairperson, Treasurer)
* Organization → Type (e.g., Educational Governance Body, Committee)

**Identifying and Extracting Entities**

Using the provided document as a starting point, I will extract unique entities that match the predefined categories in the ontology.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the document:

1. **Events**: There are several events mentioned in the document:
	* Annual Budget Meeting (Event 1)
	* Curriculum Committee Meeting (Event 2)
	* Open Session Notes (Event 3)
	* Key District Dates (Event 4)
2. **People**: I extracted the following entities:
	* Maria Rodriguez (Person 1, Chairperson of School Board)
	* Alan Chen (Person 2, Treasurer of School Board)
3. **Organizations**: There is only one entity mentioned:
	* School Board
4. **Documents**: Several documents are mentioned:
	* Budget Report 2023 (Document 1)
	* Curriculum Review Sept 2023 (Document 2)
5. **Resources**: One resource is mentioned:
	* Proposed Budget Allocations

**Structured Output**

Here's the extracted information in a structured format, following the specified output formats:
