I'll assist you in creating an ontology-based entity index from the provided School Board documents.

**Ontology Expert Mode Activation**

To begin, let's define our ontology for the School Board New Member Copilot. We will categorize entities into the following groups:

* **Events**: Meetings, proceedings, and other events related to school board operations
* **People**: Individuals involved in the school board, such as trustees, administrators, and committee members
* **Organizations**: Educational institutions, schools, and districts that participate in the school board
* **Documents**: Reports, policies, and other documents related to the school board's activities
* **Resources**: Materials, materials, and other resources used by the school board

**Instruction 1: Read the Document Carefully**

Please carefully read through the provided text document. Analyze the context of the meeting minutes or agenda for a school board meeting.

**Instruction 2: Identify and Extract Entities**

Using our defined ontology, identify unique entities mentioned in the document that match each category. For events:

* Separate each event in the output, even if multiple events are interleaved in the source text.
* Assign a distinct identifier to each event (e.g., Event_20230427_001).
* Focus on essential information to create a clear and concise index.

**Instruction 3: Provide Structured Output**

Present the extracted information in a structured format as specified below. For events:

* Include all critical attributes as defined in our ontology to facilitate comprehensive event-by-event analysis.
* Ensure each entity is described in 100 words or less across all attributes.

For example, if an event is listed as "Annual Budget Meeting", we would extract attributes such as "Event Name: Annual Budget Meeting", "Event Type: Budget Cycle", and "Date".

**Instruction 4: Dual Output Format**

Provide the index of entities in the following format:

* **Entity Type**: Events
* **Plain Text Output**
* **Structured JSON Output**

For example:
```
Plain Text Output:
- Events
  - Event 1
    - Event Name: Annual Budget Meeting
    - Event Type: Budget Cycle
    - Date: May 5th, 2023

    - Document Name: Report on Title IX Compliance

```

**Additional Notes**

* Ensure uniqueness of each entity.
* Use clear and concise language.
* Extract all entities necessary to create a comprehensive index.
