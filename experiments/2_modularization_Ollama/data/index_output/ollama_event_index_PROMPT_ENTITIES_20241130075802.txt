The text appears to be an email from Dr. William Peswani, the Superintendent of Schools for the city of Dublin, Ohio, to his board members and other stakeholders.

Here's a breakdown of what he says:

* The letter is dated February 20, 1988.
* It mentions several school-related events, including the construction of Emerald High School, which was being built in Dublin. He thanks staff from Francis Marine for hosting him during one of their visits to the site.
* Dr. Peswani also thanks various stakeholders, including teachers and students, who he has visited at the school during its early stages of construction.
* He reports that it will take several minutes for everyone to get here today due to unforeseen circumstances.

Overall, the letter seems to be a casual and apologetic email from Dr. Peswani to his colleagues and stakeholders, thanking them for their efforts in supporting the city's schools.
