It seems like this is not the original text, but rather a transcript of a meeting between two people (likely school administrators or government officials) discussing the adjournment of their meeting in memory of two staff members who had recently passed away: Kaitlyn Rapine and Rocky Orman.

The discussion appears to revolve around requesting that the meeting be adjourned in honor of these two individuals, acknowledging their contributions and loss. The meeting was held on a day when it would have normally been scheduled (November 12th), but instead, they decided to postpone it for an extra week to give everyone time to come and pay their respects.
