00:37:04.165 --> 00:37:05.385
two one minute speeches.

124
00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:09.145
So I wing Jack. Uh, I just wanted to say, I'm so honored

and my amazing students.

130
00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.985
My favorite thing about being a special education teacher is

131
00:37:23.985 --> 00:37:26.825
to really highlight and focus on all the things my students

132
00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:29.865
can do instead of all the things they can't.

133
00:37:30.445 --> 00:37:33.585
And someday I hope the whole world sees them as I do.

134
00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:37.345
For those that don't. For those that know me, um, they know

135
00:37:37.345 --> 00:37:39.865
that I strive to promote inclusivity, acceptance

136
00:37:40.285 --> 00:37:43.065
and empathy for those with disabilities on campus.

137
00:37:43.165 --> 00:37:45.225
You will often see me playing on the playground,

138
00:37:45.225 --> 00:37:48.105
going down the slide, running around my classroom, dancing

139
00:37:48.525 --> 00:37:50.785
and engaging with my students to make learning fun

140
00:37:50.785 --> 00:37:53.065
and accessible School staff

141
00:37:53.065 --> 00:37:55.305
and parents will often say hello and ask how I am.

142
00:37:55.305 --> 00:37:57.225
And my response is usually always,

143
00:37:57.685 --> 00:37:58.865
you know, living the dream.

144
00:37:59.605 --> 00:38:02.385

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:10.045
Or, Well, so these are standard, um, uh, resolutions

181
00:41:10.045 --> 00:41:12.725
that come before the board each year, uh, part

182
00:41:12.725 --> 00:41:14.125
of the resolution list

183
00:41:14.155 --> 00:41:16.285
that the board has previously approved.

184
00:41:16.905 --> 00:41:20.125
Uh, and so if the board has any questions with any

185
00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:23.485
of the language in there, we do have, um, representatives

186
00:41:23.485 --> 00:41:25.645
that can, uh, uh, respond to that.

187
00:41:26.065 --> 00:41:28.325
Uh, but each one of these are pretty standard.

188
00:41:28.505 --> 00:41:30.805
Uh, there's not action items for us

189
00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:33.845
to actually put money forth or to do.

190
00:41:33.995 --> 00:41:36.685
It's more of a recognition of, uh,

191
00:41:36.915 --> 00:41:38.245
that awareness for that month.

192
00:41:41.975 --> 00:41:43.305
Does anyone have any questions

193
00:41:43.325 --> 00:41:45.065
or anything on dyslexia Awareness month?

194
00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:48.955
Just otherwise I will take a motion to approve it.

195
00:41:48.955 --> 00:41:51.115
We decided to move, we have quite a few for this month, um,

196
00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:53.275
or this time, but we put them all up so we could kind of

197
00:41:53.825 --> 00:41:55.275
make sure we mention each one of them.

198
00:41:55.455 --> 00:41:59.515
But we will, um, vote on each one individually.

199
00:41:59.515 --> 00:42:00.995
So when takes wants to make a motion,

200
00:42:01.635 --> 00:42:04.685
I'll make a motion that we approve resolution 2024 slash

201
00:42:04.685 --> 00:42:07.085
25 dash 15 Dyslexia Awareness Month.

202
00:42:08.085 --> 00:42:12.355
I'll second. Uh, trustee Paswan.

203
00:42:13.055 --> 00:42:17.275
Aye. Everyone else? Aye. Aye. A Carrie unanimously.

204
00:42:17.985 --> 00:42:22.695
Next up it is also Character Education Month in October, um,

205
00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:27.635
focusing on excellent moral, civic and social values.

206
00:42:28.735 --> 00:42:30.635
On, on this particular one, I'll just highlight,

207
00:42:30.855 --> 00:42:33.955
as you know, we're working on developing a graduate profile,

208
00:42:34.215 --> 00:42:36.435
uh, the skills, uh, disposition

209
00:42:36.435 --> 00:42:40.155
and competencies that we want students to, uh, be strong,

210
00:42:40.155 --> 00:42:41.995
proficient at when they leave our system.

211
00:42:42.495 --> 00:42:46.795
Uh, and early on, one of the top five, uh, character traits

212
00:42:46.795 --> 00:42:49.275
or one of the top five traits is character.

213
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:50.955
So it's pretty appropriate

214
00:42:50.955 --> 00:42:53.195
that this month is character education month.

215
00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:58.935
Any questions? Uh, trustee Blackman, that's, I

216
00:42:58.935 --> 00:43:00.015
Only had a couple questions about this.

217
00:43:00.175 --> 00:43:02.655
'cause I remember our kids going through, um, some

218
00:43:02.655 --> 00:43:04.455
of these programs in elementary school,

219
00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:06.695
but I didn't necessarily know the writeup on it.

220
00:43:06.715 --> 00:43:08.175
And so I was curious 'cause there's a lot

221
00:43:08.175 --> 00:43:10.655
of discussion about social values and other things.

222
00:43:10.655 --> 00:43:11.735
Some of it highlights the

223
00:43:11.735 --> 00:43:13.055
relationship of parents leading it.

224
00:43:13.055 --> 00:43:16.055
Other times it's with, with schools supplementing it.

225
00:43:16.435 --> 00:43:18.415
But it seems there's a, I'm a little confused

226
00:43:18.415 --> 00:43:19.615
because from the writing,

227
00:43:20.115 --> 00:43:21.775
it seemed like the parents lead this,

228
00:43:21.795 --> 00:43:23.575
but at some point it's the schools, they're sort

229
00:43:23.575 --> 00:43:24.655
of enforcing it and developing it.

230
00:43:25.205 --> 00:43:28.375
What happens? Um, and I, I like the programs that we have,

231
00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:29.575
but I do know

232
00:43:29.575 --> 00:43:31.175
that the students get a little tired of some of it.

233
00:43:31.355 --> 00:43:33.295
But I wanna understand a little bit better about

234
00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:35.095
who's determining the social values.

235
00:43:35.365 --> 00:43:37.295
Because we mentioned a lot in this document,

236
00:43:37.835 --> 00:43:40.015
and if it's really the families that are determining it

237
00:43:40.015 --> 00:43:41.935
and we're supporting them, would we

238
00:43:41.935 --> 00:43:43.295
be actually stating something like this?

239
00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:44.655
I'm just really curious 'cause I never

240
00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:45.815
really saw it written up like this.

241
00:43:45.815 --> 00:43:47.375
And I would love an explanation

242
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:50.055
because I love the fact that we offer the programs,

243
00:43:50.075 --> 00:43:53.015
but I also am concerned about if somebody else comes,

244
00:43:53.105 --> 00:43:55.135
we're gonna discuss things like eth um,

245
00:43:55.755 --> 00:43:57.295
ethnic studies later.

246
00:43:57.755 --> 00:43:59.255
And I just wanna make sure that we're sensitive

247
00:43:59.255 --> 00:44:00.375
to people growing up

248
00:44:00.375 --> 00:44:01.975
and having different sets of social values

249
00:44:02.115 --> 00:44:05.495
and how we actually acknowledge it and support those.

250
00:44:05.955 --> 00:44:07.615
So somebody could answer that would be great.

251
00:44:09.675 --> 00:44:12.215
So I think each individual school, uh,

252
00:44:12.655 --> 00:44:14.455
identifies their character traits

253
00:44:14.515 --> 00:44:18.095
and they spend more of their focus on the character traits

254
00:44:18.395 --> 00:44:20.255
as opposed to the social norms.

255
00:44:20.355 --> 00:44:25.015
Um, and most of that is being supported

256
00:44:25.035 --> 00:44:26.175
by the PFCs

257
00:44:26.195 --> 00:44:27.655
and the, uh, the funding

258
00:44:27.655 --> 00:44:31.365
that they receive from the school site, uh, that's specific

259
00:44:31.425 --> 00:44:34.405
to their, um, their community.

260
00:44:34.465 --> 00:44:37.805
So in terms of the social app part of it, I, I don't think

261
00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:40.085
that that's a focus of our school sites.

262
00:44:40.985 --> 00:44:42.485
So for families who are curious about this,

263
00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:44.005
they would just need to reach out to their school

264
00:44:44.145 --> 00:44:45.925
and get involved in their, their PFC

265
00:44:45.945 --> 00:44:47.565
and that way they could actually ensure

266
00:44:47.565 --> 00:44:49.365
they're included in some of that. Is that

267
00:44:49.475 --> 00:44:50.525
That that'd be correct.

268
00:44:50.675 --> 00:44:52.565
That the school and the principal for sure.

269
00:44:52.615 --> 00:44:57.205
Great. Thank you so much. I'll make a motion

270
00:44:57.205 --> 00:45:00.965
that we approve resolution 2024 slash 25 dash 11

271
00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:02.285
character Education month.

272
00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:04.845
I'll second. I have a motion. And second.

273
00:45:04.905 --> 00:45:08.405
Any other trustee? pe Aye. Everyone else?

274
00:45:09.025 --> 00:45:11.365
Aye, Aye, aye. Carries.

275
00:45:12.885 --> 00:45:16.895
And next up, we, now, now we just have a week, a week

276
00:45:16.895 --> 00:45:18.375
of the school administrator.

277
00:45:19.395 --> 00:45:22.295
And, uh, again, we recognize all of our employees

278
00:45:22.295 --> 00:45:24.975
during employee appreciation week in the month of May.

279
00:45:25.235 --> 00:45:29.245
Um, but you know, every, it seems like every week

280
00:45:29.585 --> 00:45:32.405
or every month, there's multiple weeks where you have, um,

281
00:45:32.405 --> 00:45:35.045
administrator appreciation day, you have teacher day,

282
00:45:35.045 --> 00:45:38.925
you have, uh, counselors, uh, uh, appreciation week.

283
00:45:39.065 --> 00:45:42.725
So, uh, we certainly, uh, appreciate the amazing work

284
00:45:42.725 --> 00:45:44.965
that our administrators do, uh, in the district.

285
00:45:45.185 --> 00:45:47.045
And, uh, definitely just want

286
00:45:47.045 --> 00:45:50.485
to recognize their work early on as well as, uh,

287
00:45:50.485 --> 00:45:51.685
when we recognize all

288
00:45:51.685 --> 00:45:53.925
of our employees later on this school year in May.

289
00:45:56.815 --> 00:45:58.315
Any questions? Trustee Blackman?

290
00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:01.155
Um, so one question I had is,

291
00:46:01.305 --> 00:46:04.635
there's a couple paragraphs down, I'll try and read it off.

292
00:46:05.055 --> 00:46:07.795
Um, where is school leaders depend on network

293
00:46:07.895 --> 00:46:09.555
of support from school communities?

294
00:46:09.555 --> 00:46:13.195
That paragraph we do mention, and I'm always sensitive

295
00:46:13.195 --> 00:46:15.395
because I know there's a separation of church and state.

296
00:46:15.455 --> 00:46:16.755
We, we mention faith-based

297
00:46:16.755 --> 00:46:18.155
organizations in the context here.

298
00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:20.235
I understand that we work with organizations

299
00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:21.275
outside the school district,

300
00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:25.285
but, um, it just seemed like a weird statement to make here.

301
00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:27.565
I think we would make a statement about community

302
00:46:27.565 --> 00:46:29.085
organizations and leave it at that.

303
00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:33.245
Um, it just seems strange to place it in the document.

304
00:46:34.905 --> 00:46:36.685
Um, that was my, uh, one question.

305
00:46:36.785 --> 00:46:38.605
My other thing is, I'd like to make a comment

306
00:46:38.605 --> 00:46:41.285
that we also believe that there are, in the next paragraph,

307
00:46:41.535 --> 00:46:42.845
there are great schools because

308
00:46:42.845 --> 00:46:44.525
of great communities that support us.

309
00:46:44.585 --> 00:46:46.565
So I just wanna make sure that that's noted somehow.

310
00:46:51.435 --> 00:46:55.085
Does anyone want to take out the faith-based organizations

311
00:46:55.105 --> 00:46:56.365
or just community?

312
00:46:56.465 --> 00:46:58.365
And I mean, I, to me it's kind of,

313
00:47:01.415 --> 00:47:03.335
I saw it as, as not a only,

314
00:47:03.395 --> 00:47:05.495
but like reaching out to, to every

315
00:47:06.245 --> 00:47:07.535
kind of, throughout the community.

316
00:47:08.035 --> 00:47:11.455
Um, does anyone have a strong opinion on changing the

317
00:47:11.455 --> 00:47:14.215
wording on that one or leaving it as,

318
00:47:16.195 --> 00:47:17.565
I'll take a motion figure out.

319
00:47:20.935 --> 00:47:25.745
I'll make a motion to approve the, um, resolution 2024,

320
00:47:26.365 --> 00:47:28.545
um, slash 25 dash 12.

321
00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:32.645
Um, Dublin Alameda School, uh, Dublin,

322
00:47:32.645 --> 00:47:34.205
new Unified School District, Alameda County, state

323
00:47:34.205 --> 00:47:36.845
of California, week of the school administrator October 13th

324
00:47:36.995 --> 00:47:40.485
through the 19th of 2024 with one edit

325
00:47:40.585 --> 00:47:42.445
to remove the word and faith based.

326
00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:49.495
I'll second. All right. We have a motion and a second.

327
00:47:49.755 --> 00:47:52.845
Any other motions? All right,

328
00:47:52.845 --> 00:47:55.005
trustee PEs. Aye. Everyone else?

329
00:47:55.825 --> 00:47:58.155
Aye. Aye. It carries.

330
00:47:59.935 --> 00:48:03.915
And next up is the National School Lunch week.

331
00:48:05.185 --> 00:48:07.155
Yeah, this is the national school lunch week.

332
00:48:07.155 --> 00:48:09.795
And what's, uh, really special in California.

333
00:48:10.175 --> 00:48:13.675
Uh, we provide lunch to all students, um, one

334
00:48:13.675 --> 00:48:15.435
of just several states to do that.

335
00:48:15.655 --> 00:48:19.035
Um, and so, uh, we are very appreciative

336
00:48:19.175 --> 00:48:22.075
of our new leadership in our child nutrition program.

337
00:48:22.575 --> 00:48:25.795
Uh, and we know that, um, uh,

338
00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:29.395
already some nice strides have been made to adjust the menu.

339
00:48:29.535 --> 00:48:32.315
And with a matter of time, uh, by the end of the year,

340
00:48:32.415 --> 00:48:35.435
we should see, uh, uh, a complete change of the menu

341
00:48:35.455 --> 00:48:36.675
and how we source our food.

342
00:48:36.735 --> 00:48:40.155
And, um, we're just excited, uh, that this is an opportunity

343
00:48:40.175 --> 00:48:43.155
to recognize, um, not only the country,

344
00:48:43.255 --> 00:48:46.115
but uh, the state of California for providing all

345
00:48:46.235 --> 00:48:47.395
of our students free meals.

346
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:53.835
Any questions or comments on this one?

347
00:48:57.235 --> 00:48:59.965
I'll make a motion that we approve resolution 2024

348
00:49:00.515 --> 00:49:03.405
dash 25 dash 13 National School lunch week

349
00:49:03.425 --> 00:49:04.965
of October 14th through 18th.

350
00:49:06.745 --> 00:49:08.955
I'll second. All right. I have motion. Second.

351
00:49:09.095 --> 00:49:13.995
Any other motions? Trustee? PE 20. Aye. Everyone else?

352
00:49:14.615 --> 00:49:16.985
Aye. Aye. Aye. All righty.

353
00:49:17.045 --> 00:49:20.225
And our last one is, uh,

354
00:49:20.615 --> 00:49:24.025
America's Safe Schools Week, the end of the month. And

355
00:49:24.025 --> 00:49:26.305
We know that, uh, this has become, um,

356
00:49:26.585 --> 00:49:28.505
a trigger point across the country.

357
00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:32.985
And in, uh, the last, uh, 10, 15 years, it seems like, uh,

358
00:49:32.985 --> 00:49:36.945
school violence, uh, comes onto public campuses more

359
00:49:36.965 --> 00:49:40.265
so than ever before, as well as college campuses.

360
00:49:40.885 --> 00:49:43.785
Uh, and this is just a reminder in my mind that

361
00:49:43.885 --> 00:49:47.745
as a district, we need to do all we can to protect our,

362
00:49:47.965 --> 00:49:50.825
our schools to protect not only our students that attend,

363
00:49:50.845 --> 00:49:52.105
but our staff that work there.

364
00:49:52.645 --> 00:49:55.705
Uh, and it's also a reminder that it's all eyes

365
00:49:55.765 --> 00:49:56.865
and ears on deck.

366
00:49:56.865 --> 00:49:59.825
That if you see something, you gotta say something, uh, so

367
00:49:59.825 --> 00:50:01.745
that we can respond as quickly as possible.

368
00:50:04.795 --> 00:50:06.215
Any question? Trustee Blackman?

369
00:50:07.405 --> 00:50:09.235
Thank you. I have a couple of questions on this one.

370
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:11.995
Um, so in the third paragraph down,

371
00:50:13.025 --> 00:50:15.475
it's describing different examples of crime

372
00:50:15.475 --> 00:50:19.395
and violence, yet it lists absenteeism and poor discipline.

373
00:50:19.435 --> 00:50:21.555
I don't think either one of them is representative crime

374
00:50:21.855 --> 00:50:24.295
and violence, and I didn't know why

375
00:50:24.295 --> 00:50:25.415
they made into the paragraph.

376
00:50:25.575 --> 00:50:27.885
'cause I don't think they are examples of it at all.

377
00:50:33.495 --> 00:50:36.905
Yeah. Uh, rereading that, um, I, I take that

378
00:50:36.965 --> 00:50:40.145
and it certainly could be, um, uh,

379
00:50:40.525 --> 00:50:41.745
the wording could be adjusted,

380
00:50:41.885 --> 00:50:44.945
but I take that as no accountability.

381
00:50:45.245 --> 00:50:47.465
If, if a school site lacks accountability

382
00:50:47.465 --> 00:50:49.465
of a school district lacks accountability

383
00:50:50.085 --> 00:50:53.785
and students can get away with, um, inappropriate behavior,

384
00:50:54.295 --> 00:50:58.785
that inappropriate behavior could lead, um, to violence, um,

385
00:51:00.415 --> 00:51:02.025
absenteeism, I, I, if,

386
00:51:02.085 --> 00:51:04.945
if we don't understand why someone is absent, um,

387
00:51:05.445 --> 00:51:07.625
and do not, um, meet them where they're at

388
00:51:07.685 --> 00:51:10.025
and provide them the supports that they need to try

389
00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:13.345
to be successful, uh, certainly to reengage in school.

390
00:51:14.045 --> 00:51:18.225
Um, we know that, uh, children that are isolated,

391
00:51:18.485 --> 00:51:20.825
and especially if they're left unsupervised

392
00:51:21.005 --> 00:51:23.825
and spend all their time, uh, on social media

393
00:51:24.205 --> 00:51:28.425
or on violent games, uh, that that could, uh,

394
00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:30.345
also lead to potential violence.

395
00:51:30.525 --> 00:51:34.825
So, um, I think absenteeism is appropriate in the sense

396
00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.105
that we need to do all we can

397
00:51:36.105 --> 00:51:37.345
to meet students where they're at.

398
00:51:37.925 --> 00:51:39.705
Uh, certainly poor discipline

399
00:51:39.705 --> 00:51:41.905
to me is more about accountability, uh,

400
00:51:42.005 --> 00:51:45.225
and that, um, there needs to be consequences

401
00:51:45.525 --> 00:51:46.665
for people's actions,

402
00:51:46.725 --> 00:51:50.745
but we also have to have a way to, uh, reengage students,

403
00:51:51.285 --> 00:51:56.025
uh, that are off track, uh, due to, um, poor decisions.

404
00:51:57.605 --> 00:51:59.625
Hi. So to clarify, I wasn't really questioning the list

405
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:02.025
so much as why those two things were under the category.

406
00:52:02.425 --> 00:52:04.025
I think it could be addressed by the removal

407
00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:06.665
of the word such and as, because

408
00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:08.865
after the word violence, we're using the rest of the world

409
00:52:08.885 --> 00:52:10.705
as an example of crime and violence.

410
00:52:10.885 --> 00:52:13.105
But I actually think it's just a long laundry list

411
00:52:13.105 --> 00:52:16.385
of examples and removing the terms such and as

412
00:52:16.875 --> 00:52:19.625
after the word violence resolves the issue of the rest,

413
00:52:19.725 --> 00:52:20.825
the list of the rest of the words.

414
00:52:22.255 --> 00:52:23.135
That's okay with everybody.

415
00:52:27.495 --> 00:52:29.915
Um, I'm okay with that. Okay.

416
00:52:30.305 --> 00:52:32.635
Then the other question I had was, in the next paragraph,

417
00:52:32.635 --> 00:52:36.115
there's a, um, an allusion to the fact that supplemented

418
00:52:36.115 --> 00:52:37.515
with legislation, I don't know

419
00:52:37.515 --> 00:52:41.595
how legislation actually creates a safe school environment

420
00:52:41.595 --> 00:52:43.035
necessarily in the context

421
00:52:43.175 --> 00:52:45.235
of the overall statement of the paragraph.

422
00:52:45.815 --> 00:52:47.355
Um, we talk about district wide

423
00:52:47.355 --> 00:52:48.515
and committee wide strategies,

424
00:52:48.535 --> 00:52:50.915
and then we follow it with supplemented with legislation.

425
00:52:51.195 --> 00:52:53.355
I, I would hope that by placing pieces of paper,

426
00:52:53.355 --> 00:52:55.195
of legislation all over campus isn't

427
00:52:55.195 --> 00:52:56.275
going to make it a safer school.

428
00:52:56.795 --> 00:52:58.755
I think those terms need to be maybe rewritten

429
00:52:58.775 --> 00:52:59.915
as to precisely why.

430
00:53:00.385 --> 00:53:03.515
Perhaps it's something about using state federal resources

431
00:53:03.695 --> 00:53:07.115
or, um, supported by legislative acts with funding.

432
00:53:07.145 --> 00:53:08.145
Something like that.

433
00:53:09.325 --> 00:53:12.535
Yeah. I, I don't take that at all about just posting, um,

434
00:53:13.235 --> 00:53:17.295
um, language on any poster and putting it on a wall.

435
00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:22.495
The legislation, uh, oftentimes does come with, uh, funding,

436
00:53:22.495 --> 00:53:25.445
whether it's a state funding, federal funding, a lot

437
00:53:25.445 --> 00:53:28.365
of times it's incorporated with countywide programs.

438
00:53:28.465 --> 00:53:32.405
So I take that as actually a legislation that has funding

439
00:53:32.405 --> 00:53:35.005
behind it, not simply posting the law.

440
00:53:35.735 --> 00:53:37.625
Yeah. So if they could just say funding from,

441
00:53:37.625 --> 00:53:40.945
or something like that before that would be clear otherwise.

442
00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:44.025
Um, the next paragraph, whereas it's the responsibility

443
00:53:44.025 --> 00:53:46.265
of all citizens to enhance learning experiences

444
00:53:46.285 --> 00:53:48.425
of young people by helping to ensure fair

445
00:53:48.445 --> 00:53:49.585
and effective discipline.

446
00:53:50.185 --> 00:53:51.665
I actually took this as very shocking

447
00:53:52.175 --> 00:53:53.945
that our whole community is gonna be in charge

448
00:53:53.945 --> 00:53:55.465
of basically making certain all

449
00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:56.465
of our students are disciplined.

450
00:53:56.465 --> 00:53:57.785
And I don't think we wanna ask our community

451
00:53:57.785 --> 00:53:58.905
to run around disciplining everybody.

452
00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:02.425
So is there a reason why we actually, um,

453
00:54:03.015 --> 00:54:06.345
make it the responsive of all citizens to enhance learning

454
00:54:06.445 --> 00:54:08.425
by actually making sure we have fair

455
00:54:08.425 --> 00:54:09.465
and effective discipline?

456
00:54:09.885 --> 00:54:10.945
Should that be staff?

457
00:54:11.565 --> 00:54:13.425
Or are we really asking our entire community

458
00:54:13.425 --> 00:54:15.585
to basically ensure that we're disciplining our students?

459
00:54:16.765 --> 00:54:19.745
Um, again, I I take this as, um,

460
00:54:20.685 --> 00:54:24.545
the collective as a whole community, uh, holding, um,

461
00:54:25.305 --> 00:54:29.145
educators accountable so that, um, we treat people fairly,

462
00:54:29.605 --> 00:54:33.945
we treat people consistently, uh, so they have the same type

463
00:54:33.965 --> 00:54:37.585
of, um, violation that their consequence is the same

464
00:54:37.645 --> 00:54:40.945
or similar, that, uh, they're not disparities

465
00:54:40.945 --> 00:54:42.305
between ethnic groups.

466
00:54:42.495 --> 00:54:45.585
They're not disparities between male and female.

467
00:54:46.205 --> 00:54:49.065
So no, the citizens aren't involved in the disciplining.

468
00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:51.865
They're just holding the, uh, um, the community

469
00:54:51.865 --> 00:54:53.785
as a whole is holding the school district accountable

470
00:54:53.785 --> 00:54:55.185
to treat our students fairly

471
00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:58.665
and, uh, provide, uh, consequences

472
00:54:58.735 --> 00:55:00.105
that are consistent and fair.

473
00:55:01.705 --> 00:55:03.505
I agree with what you just explained.

474
00:55:03.565 --> 00:55:05.465
I'd love to see that codified in this paragraph though.

475
00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:07.305
Okay. That's my only comment. Thank you.

476
00:55:12.845 --> 00:55:15.345
Um, I'll make a motion approving

477
00:55:16.305 --> 00:55:19.305
resolution number 2024 slash 25 dash 14,

478
00:55:19.785 --> 00:55:21.665
recognizing October 20th to 26.

479
00:55:21.965 --> 00:55:25.665
2024 is America's Safe School Week with the, um,

480
00:55:25.715 --> 00:55:28.025
third paragraph removing the words such as

481
00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:29.265
before substance abuse

482
00:55:35.775 --> 00:55:36.955
Motion on for, do you have a second?

483
00:55:39.115 --> 00:55:41.645
I'll second. I have a motion a second.

484
00:55:41.825 --> 00:55:45.885
Any other motions? Okay, trustee pe

485
00:55:47.335 --> 00:55:48.335
Aye. Everyone else?

486
00:55:48.335 --> 00:55:49.835
Aye. Aye. Aye.

487
00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:52.035
Aye. All right. It carries.

488
00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:56.535
Um, next up we have our student board member report.

489
00:56:01.235 --> 00:56:03.485
Okay. Hello everyone.

490
00:56:03.825 --> 00:56:05.125
So at Valley High School,

491
00:56:05.525 --> 00:56:06.805
students have been busy wrapping up

492
00:56:06.805 --> 00:56:08.005
their first quarter this week.

493
00:56:08.675 --> 00:56:10.565
Last week they enjoyed their fall spirit week

494
00:56:10.565 --> 00:56:12.565
and fall festival participating in,

495
00:56:12.625 --> 00:56:14.365
in activities like a scavenger hunt,

496
00:56:14.365 --> 00:56:15.805
pumpkin bowling and more.

497
00:56:16.335 --> 00:56:18.745
They also had their first karaoke lunch event at

498
00:56:18.805 --> 00:56:20.545
of the year, which went very well.

499
00:56:21.275 --> 00:56:22.765
Looking ahead to the next quarter,

500
00:56:23.245 --> 00:56:25.045
upcoming events include a school field trip

501
00:56:25.045 --> 00:56:27.125
to the Exploratorium in San Francisco,

502
00:56:27.465 --> 00:56:31.285
the annual Halloween themed candy, corn, C cup competition,

503
00:56:31.625 --> 00:56:33.005
and their Thanksgiving potluck.

504
00:56:33.605 --> 00:56:35.805
Students at VHS have also been engaging in a variety

505
00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:38.085
of coursework and opportunities from Las Positas college

506
00:56:38.085 --> 00:56:41.525
classes, culinary and also culinary arts, leadership

507
00:56:41.685 --> 00:56:42.885
and financial literacy.

508
00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:46.625
At Dublin High School, many homecoming events are in the

509
00:56:46.625 --> 00:56:47.625
final stages of planning.

510
00:56:48.175 --> 00:56:49.905
Next week, we'll have all our activities,

511
00:56:49.905 --> 00:56:52.545
including the football game, the area build, the parade

512
00:56:53.155 --> 00:56:54.505
rally, and the actual dance.

513
00:56:55.095 --> 00:56:58.625
Last week, students from PLTW Project League the Way honors

514
00:56:58.625 --> 00:57:01.545
biomedical intervention courses presented their findings on

515
00:57:01.545 --> 00:57:03.705
topics related to human physiology, such

516
00:57:03.705 --> 00:57:05.305
as reaction times based on color

517
00:57:05.405 --> 00:57:07.665
and how smiling might affect pain tolerance.

518
00:57:08.055 --> 00:57:10.065
They shared their work with professionals from Kaiser

519
00:57:10.425 --> 00:57:14.625
Permanente BioRad Laboratories, PTM Bio, LLC,

520
00:57:14.625 --> 00:57:17.345
Pacific Biosciences, USD board members and more.

521
00:57:18.225 --> 00:57:20.185
Additionally, false sports have been going strong

522
00:57:20.185 --> 00:57:22.665
with the student section, doing an excellent job cheering on

523
00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:25.975
all our athletes at Emerald High School.

524
00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:28.455
They recently started a year long class competition called

525
00:57:28.455 --> 00:57:31.775
the Arrow Board, where classes take where classes compete

526
00:57:31.775 --> 00:57:33.535
to get closer to the bullseye, representing

527
00:57:33.535 --> 00:57:34.815
how spirited their grade is.

528
00:57:35.445 --> 00:57:38.175
Last week students enjoyed their HOWA

529
00:57:38.395 --> 00:57:40.295
or Housewarming Dance Event Rally

530
00:57:40.355 --> 00:57:43.215
and several other activities with these big events.

531
00:57:43.315 --> 00:57:45.375
Now behind them, the leadership students are already getting

532
00:57:45.375 --> 00:57:47.695
up to plan and organize their next set of upcoming events,

533
00:57:48.135 --> 00:57:50.135
ensuring they keep momentum in the school Spirit high

534
00:57:50.135 --> 00:57:51.695
throughout the, throughout their first year.

535
00:57:52.715 --> 00:57:55.575
In addition, the tobacco Use Prevention Education program

536
00:57:55.875 --> 00:57:58.175
has officially started with planning underway

537
00:57:58.175 --> 00:58:00.215
for the Bread Ribbon Week to promote awareness

538
00:58:00.315 --> 00:58:02.455
and prevention Emerald High's.

539
00:58:02.525 --> 00:58:05.455
DECA also had their first unofficial training session in

540
00:58:05.455 --> 00:58:08.575
preparation for the upcoming upcoming mini con setting the

541
00:58:08.575 --> 00:58:10.335
stage for a successful competition season.

542
00:58:11.725 --> 00:58:13.775
Last week, I sent out lead applications

543
00:58:13.775 --> 00:58:14.775
for the committee groups

544
00:58:15.115 --> 00:58:17.375
and the signup forms indicated that 40 out

545
00:58:17.375 --> 00:58:19.575
of the 50 committee members expressed interest in

546
00:58:19.575 --> 00:58:20.615
taking on leadership roles.

547
00:58:21.485 --> 00:58:24.335
I've been working on organizing donation boxes at elementary

548
00:58:24.335 --> 00:58:26.175
schools for the Afghan Student Association,

549
00:58:26.835 --> 00:58:29.255
and last night I attended the budget meeting

550
00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:31.575
and gained a lot of valuable, the the budget meeting

551
00:58:31.595 --> 00:58:33.255
and gained a lot of valuable insights

552
00:58:33.255 --> 00:58:34.615
into our current situation.

553
00:58:34.795 --> 00:58:37.095
And I spend time encouraging more students to get involved.

554
00:58:37.675 --> 00:58:38.935
Lastly, I have a set date

555
00:58:38.935 --> 00:58:40.775
for the first student advisory council meeting,

556
00:58:40.905 --> 00:58:41.935
which is next Monday.

557
00:58:42.435 --> 00:58:44.655
I'm excited to gather input from the young students across

558
00:58:44.655 --> 00:58:46.015
the different schools in our district.

559
00:58:48.275 --> 00:58:52.895
All right, thank you. Um, it's DTAI see

560
00:58:54.255 --> 00:58:55.335
DTA have a statement tonight.

561
00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:58.285
Oh, they do not. Um, CSCA.

562
00:59:00.905 --> 00:59:01.905
Okay,

563
00:59:25.805 --> 00:59:26.925
I should know this one by now.

564
00:59:28.795 --> 00:59:32.195
My bad. I wanna make announcement.

565
00:59:32.775 --> 00:59:36.715
Um, tonight I am not here as the President of CSCA.

566
00:59:37.705 --> 00:59:40.545
I left my post at the end of last month.

567
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:45.025
So this is my first board meeting, not being president.

568
00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:47.945
For the past 15 years, I was the president.

569
00:59:48.565 --> 00:59:51.505
I'm passing the baton off to my first vp.

570
00:59:51.935 --> 00:59:53.345
That would be Karen Chamberlain.

571
00:59:53.645 --> 00:59:56.385
She is a campus supervisor over at Emerald High.

572
00:59:57.005 --> 01:00:01.985
She is gonna be filling in my chair until election time

573
01:00:02.885 --> 01:00:05.425
and then so on for more.

574
01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:07.895
But one thing before I leave here,

575
01:00:08.515 --> 01:00:11.975
and I wanna make sure that you guys are all understanding

576
01:00:13.035 --> 01:00:15.255
the budget crisis is a big thing.

577
01:00:16.565 --> 01:00:21.265
One thing is when you cut FTEs from classified,

578
01:00:21.645 --> 01:00:23.825
you're not talking about one person.

579
01:00:24.665 --> 01:00:28.285
You're talking about two to three people equaling

580
01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:29.805
that one FTE.

581
01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:34.435
So be careful when you look at the FTE part of it saying,

582
01:00:34.455 --> 01:00:38.355
oh yeah, we're gonna lay off five FTEs for classified.

583
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.695
Well, I guess what, you're actually eliminating almost eight

584
01:00:41.915 --> 01:00:43.255
to 10 people right there.

585
01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:45.685
So please be careful

586
01:00:45.785 --> 01:00:49.205
and let's keep the cuts low enough just to amount

587
01:00:49.225 --> 01:00:52.825
of people wise and not by the FTE wise.

588
01:00:53.585 --> 01:00:54.625
I ask you that, please.

589
01:00:55.225 --> 01:00:57.805
And so I'm gonna pass the baton off to Karen Chamberlain.

590
01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:05.655
Hi, good evening, uh, superintendent fun vice

591
01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:08.095

My name is Karen Pagan Chamberlain,

593
01:01:10.635 --> 01:01:11.855

594
01:01:12.275 --> 01:01:14.255

596
01:01:17.595 --> 01:01:20.255
On behalf of our chapter, we wish to thank Keoki

597
01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:24.095
for his 15 years of service to CSEA.

598
01:01:24.465 --> 01:01:25.455
Thank you Kiki.

599
01:01:31.545 --> 01:01:35.165
Um, as Keoki mentioned, uh, earlier upon his departure,

600
01:01:35.395 --> 01:01:37.245
I've stepped into the role of president

601
01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:38.765
through the line of succession.

602
01:01:39.505 --> 01:01:41.965
So, hello, it's a pleasure to be here tonight.

603
01:01:43.225 --> 01:01:45.245
Um, a little background.

604
01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:48.365
In 2007, um, my family moved to Dublin

605
01:01:48.665 --> 01:01:49.685
and I began working

606
01:01:49.785 --> 01:01:51.925
as a campus supervisor at Dublin High School.

607
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:56.045
And this year, I, I transferred over to Emerald High School,

608
01:01:56.455 --> 01:01:58.285
still working as a campus supervisor.

609
01:01:58.605 --> 01:02:01.245
I do love my job. I do love supporting our students.

610
01:02:02.305 --> 01:02:04.605
Um, over the years I've had the privilege

611
01:02:04.605 --> 01:02:06.645
of supporting our students in the community

612
01:02:06.825 --> 01:02:08.485
and my role as campus supervisor.

613
01:02:09.165 --> 01:02:12.525
I am now excited to shift my focus towards supporting our

614
01:02:12.525 --> 01:02:15.445
classified employee members within this district.

615
01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:19.325
I believe that supporting our members will intern turn

616
01:02:19.715 --> 01:02:22.445
support our students community and district.

617
01:02:23.265 --> 01:02:25.925
I'm excited about the work we can accomplish together,

618
01:02:26.425 --> 01:02:28.245
and I look forward to a successful

619
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.605
partnership for all of us.

620
01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:32.565
So thank you very much. Thank you.

621
01:02:35.325 --> 01:02:37.955
Thank you. Thank you again, Koke, and welcome to Karen.

622

and she will introduce the team.

634
01:03:07.755 --> 01:03:08.755
Thank you.

635
01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.595
Good evening. Good evening.

636
01:03:14.735 --> 01:03:17.835
Uh, president Pellum, um, trustees, uh,

637
01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:21.075
superintendent Frank, and members of Executive Cabinet.

638
01:03:21.655 --> 01:03:23.275
We are delighted to be here this evening

639
01:03:23.455 --> 01:03:25.915
to present the Ethnic Studies Course.

640
01:03:26.215 --> 01:03:27.435
One outline for you.

641
01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:32.745
Um, as a little bit of background, um,

642
01:03:33.675 --> 01:03:35.095
ethnic studies is not a new course.

643
01:03:35.675 --> 01:03:39.175
So, uh, ethnic studies has been taught in, uh,

644
01:03:39.175 --> 01:03:41.735
schools across California for more than 10 years,

645
01:03:41.795 --> 01:03:45.175
and has been a graduation requirement actually in many

646
01:03:45.695 --> 01:03:48.335
districts prior to it becoming a state requirement.

647
01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:50.015
In 2016,

648
01:03:50.015 --> 01:03:53.735
however, governor Jerry Brown did sign AB 2016,

649
01:03:54.105 --> 01:03:58.135
which created a commission to develop a model, um,

650
01:03:59.055 --> 01:04:02.015
a model, uh, curriculum for ethnic studies.

651
01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:05.455
And the California State Board of Education did adopt

652
01:04:05.455 --> 01:04:07.175
that ethnic studies model curriculum.

653
01:04:07.235 --> 01:04:11.965
In March of 2021, in October

654
01:04:12.025 --> 01:04:13.045
of that year, uh,

655
01:04:13.285 --> 01:04:15.885
governor Newsom did sign a bill requiring a one semester

656
01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.125
ethnic studies course

657
01:04:17.425 --> 01:04:19.845
for all California high school graduates, beginning

658
01:04:19.845 --> 01:04:21.685
with the class of 2030.

659
01:04:22.265 --> 01:04:25.445
And in 2022, you might recall that the curriculum council,

660
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.405
uh, here in Dublin

661
01:04:27.735 --> 01:04:30.445
after, uh, hearing a recommendation from the graduation

662
01:04:30.445 --> 01:04:32.565
requirements Task force recommended

663
01:04:32.565 --> 01:04:34.685
that all students be required

664
01:04:34.685 --> 01:04:38.325
to take an ethnic studies course, uh, beginning in

665
01:04:38.555 --> 01:04:42.965
with the class of 2027 in grades, uh, 10 through 12,

666
01:04:43.685 --> 01:04:45.205
sometime during grades 10 through 12.

667
01:04:45.585 --> 01:04:49.045
We subsequently, subsequently asked to extend that to,

668
01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:52.125
or delay that until the class of 2028 to be sure

669
01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:54.765
that everybody had clear understanding about what

670
01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:56.525
that new graduation requirement would look like

671
01:04:56.745 --> 01:04:57.765
and give all our students

672
01:04:57.785 --> 01:04:59.325
and families time to plan for

673
01:04:59.325 --> 01:05:01.125
that in their four year high school plan.

674
01:05:01.905 --> 01:05:06.205
Um, the DUSD course, uh, of study for curricula

675
01:05:06.225 --> 01:05:09.325
or for ethnic studies is modeled after the model curriculum.

676
01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.565
You're gonna hear a little bit more about that, uh,

677
01:05:11.565 --> 01:05:13.565
this evening from, um, a couple

678
01:05:13.565 --> 01:05:15.325
of additional folks who are with me this evening.

679
01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:17.325
And I wanted to point out

680
01:05:17.325 --> 01:05:19.965
that the reason we're bringing this course outline

681
01:05:20.025 --> 01:05:23.325
to the board for, uh, discussion this evening is

682
01:05:23.325 --> 01:05:26.925
because a locally developed ethnic studies course under, um,

683
01:05:27.245 --> 01:05:28.885
ed code is required to be presented.

684
01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:32.245
Um, the public given an opportunity to comment on the course

685
01:05:32.245 --> 01:05:35.045
of study and then adopted subsequently

686
01:05:35.045 --> 01:05:36.205
at a different board meeting.

687
01:05:36.825 --> 01:05:38.085
So for additional, um,

688
01:05:38.085 --> 01:05:41.605
information about our specific ethnic studies, one course,

689
01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.965
uh, I have with me this evening, Whitney Dwyer,

690
01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:47.045
our assistant principal at Dublin High School,

691
01:05:47.065 --> 01:05:49.725
and a former ethnic studies teacher in Oakland Unified

692
01:05:49.725 --> 01:05:53.605
School District, as well as, um, a contributor to Oakland's,

693
01:05:54.025 --> 01:05:56.405
uh, model ethnic studies curriculum.

694
01:05:56.665 --> 01:05:59.405
And then also Katie Tombs, who is our, um,

695
01:05:59.505 --> 01:06:02.965
ethnic studies teacher extraordinaire here in Dublin.

696
01:06:02.985 --> 01:06:04.405
Um, she's been teaching the course

697
01:06:04.465 --> 01:06:06.405
and we'll have more to share about what

698
01:06:06.405 --> 01:06:07.405
that experience has looked like

699
01:06:07.405 --> 01:06:09.445
and her recommendations for the course moving forward.

700
01:06:10.855 --> 01:06:15.495
Thank you, Sherry. So the ethnic studies model curriculum

701
01:06:15.595 --> 01:06:17.855
is really focused on what we call the core for.

702
01:06:18.355 --> 01:06:21.895
Um, that would be the African American community, Chicano

703
01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:24.975
Chicanex, Latinx, native American,

704
01:06:25.195 --> 01:06:27.375
and Asian American Pacific Islander studies.

705
01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:31.975
Um, being that those communities are generally marginalized

706
01:06:32.115 --> 01:06:34.855
in US history courses, so it's really, um,

707
01:06:35.035 --> 01:06:37.535
ethnic studies since its inception is designed

708
01:06:37.635 --> 01:06:38.975
to really raise up the voices

709
01:06:39.075 --> 01:06:41.375
and the stories of people in our country

710
01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:42.935
and in our community, um,

711
01:06:42.995 --> 01:06:44.935
who have not been historically represented.

712
01:06:46.315 --> 01:06:49.255
Um, it has also evolved to include

713
01:06:49.595 --> 01:06:52.575
and really, um, broaden the definition.

714
01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.175
So while it is still focused on the Core four,

715
01:06:55.555 --> 01:06:58.335
it also allows flexibility for communities

716
01:06:58.335 --> 01:06:59.455
to focus on cultures

717
01:06:59.455 --> 01:07:01.655
that are represented in their communities.

718
01:07:01.755 --> 01:07:04.655
And so there's some flexibility to adapt the curriculum

719
01:07:04.655 --> 01:07:06.335
to address our demographics.

720
01:07:06.595 --> 01:07:09.495
And mixed tombs is gonna talk more about how

721
01:07:09.495 --> 01:07:10.935
that happens in Dublin.

722
01:07:11.915 --> 01:07:14.105
Thanks. Hi everybody.

723
01:07:14.885 --> 01:07:16.985
Um, I'm Katie Tombs or Mixed Tombs.

724
01:07:17.445 --> 01:07:19.305
Um, thanks for giving me some time

725
01:07:19.365 --> 01:07:20.385
to talk about ethnic studies.

726
01:07:20.565 --> 01:07:21.905
I'm always super excited about it.

727
01:07:22.445 --> 01:07:25.265
Um, our ethnic studies course pilot started

728
01:07:25.655 --> 01:07:28.745
with an initial course outline that we developed as a team.

729
01:07:29.005 --> 01:07:31.065
Um, generally the team was reflective

730
01:07:31.065 --> 01:07:33.785
of our humanities departments, the English and history, uh,

731
01:07:33.845 --> 01:07:35.225
or social science departments.

732
01:07:35.805 --> 01:07:39.625
Um, and then from that we built a pilot course, uh,

733
01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.865
which I taught last year, first semester.

734
01:07:42.245 --> 01:07:43.865
Um, it is a one semester course.

735
01:07:44.565 --> 01:07:47.225
Um, and so we taught it as an elective.

736
01:07:47.325 --> 01:07:50.665
So meaning students chosen, we had a mighty team of 12

737
01:07:50.685 --> 01:07:52.185
of us and me.

738
01:07:52.245 --> 01:07:55.185
So it was the perfect class size, I must say. I loved it.

739
01:07:55.485 --> 01:07:57.065
Um, we also had an amazing, uh,

740
01:07:57.065 --> 01:07:58.465
paraeducator with one of our students.

741
01:07:58.485 --> 01:08:00.305
We had 10th through 12th grade represented.

742
01:08:00.605 --> 01:08:02.345
Uh, so we had this kind of like multi-ethnic,

743
01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:03.465
multi-generational space.

744
01:08:03.605 --> 01:08:05.745
It was an awesome course. Um,

745
01:08:06.285 --> 01:08:09.065
and so this year I'm teaching it again as an elective, uh,

746
01:08:09.065 --> 01:08:10.465
but not till second semester.

747
01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:13.345
Um, and so yeah, we're super excited.

748
01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.985
We've got a small but mighty crew again.

749
01:08:15.545 --> 01:08:16.645
Um, and this is

750
01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:19.325
to be expected in a new elective, and that's okay.

751
01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:21.205
But I'm really excited for us to grow

752
01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:22.845
and kind of look at our development

753
01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:24.885
of the course once it becomes a requirement.

754
01:08:25.865 --> 01:08:28.965
Um, okay, this is slide with a lot

755
01:08:28.965 --> 01:08:30.285
of jargon, a lot of words on it.

756
01:08:30.865 --> 01:08:35.125
And before we get to this, I want bring students' voices in

757
01:08:35.355 --> 01:08:36.645
because in all honesty,

758
01:08:37.005 --> 01:08:39.805
students are often much better at saying things than adults

759
01:08:40.025 --> 01:08:41.805
and very concise and direct points.

760
01:08:42.225 --> 01:08:43.765
So these were some reflections

761
01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:44.885
and then we'll bounce back to this,

762
01:08:45.385 --> 01:08:47.125
but these are some reflections from students.

763
01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:49.525
Um, this is their post-course survey.

764
01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:53.045
And, um, I just wanted to highlight kind of

765
01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:54.325
what they took from the course,

766
01:08:54.385 --> 01:08:56.085
and I think it reflects kind of

767
01:08:56.085 --> 01:08:57.165
what the course is all about.

768
01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:58.645
We had one student that said

769
01:08:58.645 --> 01:09:00.765
that they felt like the things they learned were relevant

770
01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:03.485
to modern issues, and that they felt

771
01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:05.765
that these were things they needed to know to be able

772
01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:08.165
to contribute to important conversations in the future.

773
01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:12.365
Another said that the part they remember most is learning

774
01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:13.765
about different types of oppression,

775
01:09:13.905 --> 01:09:16.485
but also the concept of interconnectedness.

776
01:09:17.025 --> 01:09:18.165
And they felt like they understand

777
01:09:18.165 --> 01:09:19.845
themselves in a deeper way.

778
01:09:20.665 --> 01:09:22.765
Uh, another student said they thought it was useful

779
01:09:22.765 --> 01:09:25.245
because they understood each other's cultural experiences,

780
01:09:25.665 --> 01:09:26.725
but also their own,

781
01:09:26.905 --> 01:09:28.405
and were able to talk about that in a

782
01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:29.845
comfortable and safe space.

783
01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:32.965
And then, you know, there's always that one kid in the room

784
01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:34.685
that's like, you know, I'd love more time,

785
01:09:34.835 --> 01:09:36.725
more discussion, more complexity.

786
01:09:37.265 --> 01:09:39.005
But they did caveat that with, well, maybe

787
01:09:39.005 --> 01:09:42.565
that's more ethnic studies, two material, um, which is fair.

788
01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:43.725
Uh, but they were looking for more

789
01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.205
complexity to really dive in.

790
01:09:45.205 --> 01:09:46.885
It's a one semester course, so it's pretty brief.

791
01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:50.405
Um, and so we try to cover a lot of material in that time.

792
01:09:51.245 --> 01:09:53.765
I think students are highlighting what the state

793
01:09:54.385 --> 01:09:56.005
has put in a lot of words here.

794
01:09:56.215 --> 01:09:58.085
These are kind of the key outcomes.

795
01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:00.765
Uh, if you notice these eight key outcomes

796
01:10:00.785 --> 01:10:04.455
and goals, these are lofty goals, uh, for

797
01:10:04.455 --> 01:10:08.095
what a one class can do in, in a, in public school setting.

798
01:10:08.515 --> 01:10:09.655
And so these are lofty goals.

799
01:10:09.655 --> 01:10:10.855
These are what we've been instructed

800
01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:11.895
to generate in our course.

801
01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:15.495
And then these are the six C's or so I like to call them.

802
01:10:16.075 --> 01:10:18.695
And we'll see that they're asking us to cultivate,

803
01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:22.575
to celebrate, to center, to critique, to challenge,

804
01:10:23.075 --> 01:10:24.895
and to connect and

805
01:10:24.895 --> 01:10:27.095
to break this down like we do for my students.

806
01:10:27.115 --> 01:10:29.575
In chunking this, you can look at every bullet point

807
01:10:30.035 --> 01:10:32.375
and probably find two

808
01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:35.535
or maybe three words that need a definition.

809
01:10:36.255 --> 01:10:39.975
A discussion are complex, could be problematized,

810
01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.415
and that is exactly ethnic studies.

811
01:10:42.635 --> 01:10:44.655
The first thing we teach is the language.

812
01:10:45.235 --> 01:10:47.615
How do we talk about cultural competence?

813
01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:51.975
How do we have 21st century civil discussions in a way

814
01:10:51.975 --> 01:10:53.615
that reflects all of our differences,

815
01:10:53.755 --> 01:10:56.855
but still makes every student feel included and strong

816
01:10:57.475 --> 01:10:58.895
and more importantly, able

817
01:10:58.895 --> 01:11:00.495
to make a mistake without being canceled?

818
01:11:00.845 --> 01:11:02.575
Okay, that is really important.

819
01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.735
We want our students to feel strong and,

820
01:11:04.955 --> 01:11:06.455
and adaptive in the classroom

821
01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:09.375
and give them opportunities to work through some of this

822
01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:12.335
before they're in these amazing places that, you know,

823
01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:15.165
they're going board rooms and operating rooms

824
01:11:15.585 --> 01:11:16.885
and amazing rooms like these.

825
01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:18.725
So I think that's the idea here.

826
01:11:19.245 --> 01:11:21.005
Students say it a little bit more cleanly, I think,

827
01:11:21.465 --> 01:11:23.925
but these are some of the goals that they're asking us

828
01:11:23.945 --> 01:11:25.405
to accomplish with the course.

829
01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:29.285
Um, with that being said, we taught the course one time

830
01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:33.845
through, um, and had some pretty amazing successes.

831
01:11:34.345 --> 01:11:37.605
Uh, I think the first one is that our courses designed

832
01:11:37.865 --> 01:11:39.485
and organized around themes.

833
01:11:40.835 --> 01:11:43.085
There's kind of these two recommendations

834
01:11:43.185 --> 01:11:44.205
in the model curriculum.

835
01:11:44.505 --> 01:11:46.445
It would be lovely if they gave us a binder

836
01:11:46.445 --> 01:11:48.405
and said, this is what you should teach,

837
01:11:49.065 --> 01:11:50.965
but we're in California so we're too diverse

838
01:11:50.965 --> 01:11:52.005
and too amazing for that.

839
01:11:52.385 --> 01:11:54.005
And so they give us recommendations.

840
01:11:54.585 --> 01:11:57.925
Two of the recommendations are you can teach units based on

841
01:11:57.925 --> 01:12:00.445
each of the ethnicities known as the core four.

842
01:12:01.225 --> 01:12:04.085
Um, these come from the 1968 protests

843
01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:07.645
around adding ethnic studies to the uc and CSU campuses.

844
01:12:08.785 --> 01:12:11.365
Um, and the other option is a thematic focus.

845
01:12:11.785 --> 01:12:14.205
Uh, our team elected to do a thematic focus,

846
01:12:14.345 --> 01:12:16.845
and I think it was a really strong success in our pilot

847
01:12:17.235 --> 01:12:19.485
because it allowed for every student

848
01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.765
to enter from their own cultural background

849
01:12:21.825 --> 01:12:24.165
and find that interconnectedness in the topics

850
01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:25.285
that we were exploring.

851
01:12:26.505 --> 01:12:29.005
Um, another huge success from the course was

852
01:12:29.005 --> 01:12:31.525
that this is an interdisciplinary study.

853
01:12:32.105 --> 01:12:34.245
Uh, that's my favorite thing about ethnic studies.

854
01:12:34.545 --> 01:12:37.525
It is this idea that we are looking at everything from

855
01:12:37.525 --> 01:12:40.525
political science to sociology, anthropology

856
01:12:40.705 --> 01:12:44.165
and economics history and writing arts.

857
01:12:45.105 --> 01:12:49.485
And it was so successful to see students like bring

858
01:12:49.555 --> 01:12:52.005
what they do best to the classroom.

859
01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:56.005
For example, I assigned a kind of generic, uh,

860
01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:58.285
poster project, and I had three students

861
01:12:58.345 --> 01:13:00.325
who were all in marching band go, sorry,

862
01:13:00.415 --> 01:13:01.845
could we compose a song?

863
01:13:02.525 --> 01:13:04.605
I was like, yeah, let's do that.

864
01:13:05.185 --> 01:13:07.245
Um, and they were able to develop a song

865
01:13:07.245 --> 01:13:08.805
that integrated their parents'

866
01:13:08.825 --> 01:13:10.405
voices that they had talked about.

867
01:13:10.515 --> 01:13:11.685
It's so cool, I'll send it to you.

868
01:13:11.945 --> 01:13:13.285
Um, but it's really great

869
01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:16.845
and I think it's just speaks to that this course can bring

870
01:13:17.365 --> 01:13:18.405
multiple disciplines in

871
01:13:18.705 --> 01:13:22.245
and have students start to think in more lateral ways

872
01:13:22.785 --> 01:13:24.205
to think about what their skills are.

873
01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.725
And then another huge success was

874
01:13:26.725 --> 01:13:29.765
that in March I led like a two-part professional

875
01:13:29.765 --> 01:13:33.405
development, both with kind of self-selecting, uh,

876
01:13:33.405 --> 01:13:35.245
different groups, teachers that wanted to join,

877
01:13:35.505 --> 01:13:37.685
and then also the entire social science department.

878
01:13:38.025 --> 01:13:41.525
And out of that, we found a really great vertical alignment

879
01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:45.525
between the ninth grade, like freshman seminar

880
01:13:45.585 --> 01:13:48.445
and health curriculum where they explore topics of identity

881
01:13:49.145 --> 01:13:51.165
and the 12th grade English courses

882
01:13:51.295 --> 01:13:53.685
where they're exploring in depth texts

883
01:13:53.685 --> 01:13:55.565
of identity and ethnicity.

884
01:13:55.985 --> 01:13:57.645
And we need something to bridge that.

885
01:13:57.985 --> 01:14:01.085
We need something to take students from those early learning

886
01:14:01.095 --> 01:14:03.925
parts in ninth grade and help them bridge

887
01:14:04.145 --> 01:14:06.965
and build that conversational ability around culture

888
01:14:07.465 --> 01:14:10.885
and ethnicity and race so that they're ready for this,

889
01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:13.485
again, graduation requirement at the end

890
01:14:13.485 --> 01:14:14.725
of their four years in high school.

891
01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:16.805
So I think ethnic studies is a really great

892
01:14:16.805 --> 01:14:18.325
bridge to fit there.

893
01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:21.205
Uh, I'll try to speed up. Sorry.

894
01:14:21.465 --> 01:14:23.085
The other thing is, uh, some changes.

895
01:14:23.665 --> 01:14:27.085
So I'm the one ethnic studies teacher. It's just me.

896
01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:28.925
Um, and this is not me creating

897
01:14:28.925 --> 01:14:30.285
this in a basement somewhere.

898
01:14:30.555 --> 01:14:33.005
I've been really fortunate to work with the uc, Berkeley

899
01:14:33.105 --> 01:14:36.205
and the uc Davis, uh, high school Ethnic studies institute.

900
01:14:36.845 --> 01:14:37.965
A lot of institutes

901
01:14:37.985 --> 01:14:40.485
or a lot of higher education universities are trying

902
01:14:40.485 --> 01:14:42.525
to make sure that high school teachers are prepared,

903
01:14:42.915 --> 01:14:44.925
that we're trained, that we have curriculum

904
01:14:44.925 --> 01:14:48.605
and content that we're supported to get our students ready

905
01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.725
for what they have, which is often American culture

906
01:14:52.225 --> 01:14:54.565
and ethnic studies requirements for their students.

907
01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:57.405
So our students right now are graduating into

908
01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:59.205
that requirement to go to uc, Berkeley,

909
01:14:59.665 --> 01:15:01.245
and haven't taken this course yet.

910
01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:03.925
Um, and so it's really important that we are aligned

911
01:15:04.185 --> 01:15:07.485
to their high expectations so that our students are ready

912
01:15:07.585 --> 01:15:09.965
to walk into those schools and be super successful.

913
01:15:10.865 --> 01:15:13.285
Um, we also realigned the unit slightly just to kind

914
01:15:13.285 --> 01:15:15.285
of match our regional partners a little bit

915
01:15:15.305 --> 01:15:17.765
to find some consistency in neighboring districts.

916
01:15:18.705 --> 01:15:20.645
And the last thing is it gave us the option

917
01:15:20.645 --> 01:15:21.885
to really include a unit

918
01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:25.045
where students can focus on social movements, uh,

919
01:15:25.065 --> 01:15:26.245
and social movement theory

920
01:15:26.305 --> 01:15:28.525
and change, um, to give them like kind

921
01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.405
of a real world context to what they're learning.

922
01:15:31.065 --> 01:15:34.485
So those are some of the wins, some of the changes, um,

923
01:15:35.505 --> 01:15:38.125
and this is just a snapshot, this is in the course outline,

924
01:15:38.145 --> 01:15:41.045
but these are our five, uh, learning standards.

925
01:15:42.155 --> 01:15:44.965
Each of them have sub learning targets.

926
01:15:45.465 --> 01:15:48.405
Um, these were written by the team here at Dublin High.

927
01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:50.405
The model curriculum doesn't provide

928
01:15:51.185 --> 01:15:52.765
any specific learning targets.

929
01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:54.965
They provide guidance, but no specific targets.

930
01:15:55.345 --> 01:15:58.725
So we worked backwards from the San Francisco State Santa

931
01:15:58.725 --> 01:16:00.925
Clara University ethnic studies requirements,

932
01:16:01.345 --> 01:16:03.685
and kind of mapped those backwards onto a

933
01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:04.765
nine through 12 level.

934
01:16:05.455 --> 01:16:08.125
These are some of the units, uh, that are kind

935
01:16:08.125 --> 01:16:09.205
of thematically focused.

936
01:16:09.425 --> 01:16:11.165
And then also the unit assessments.

937
01:16:11.225 --> 01:16:13.805
The only thing I'll say about those is that the idea is

938
01:16:13.805 --> 01:16:16.725
to provide something other than just a research paper here.

939
01:16:16.915 --> 01:16:18.885
They are gonna do some heavy lifting on the research

940
01:16:18.885 --> 01:16:21.965
presentation, but we also wanna give students a chance

941
01:16:21.965 --> 01:16:24.365
to write narratives, to do oral histories

942
01:16:24.365 --> 01:16:27.005
and use technology to use arts

943
01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:28.565
and self-expression through music.

944
01:16:29.065 --> 01:16:30.565
Uh, and to do some real world writing

945
01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:32.165
in the advocacy project.

946
01:16:32.705 --> 01:16:34.965
So we try to, you know, keep it interesting

947
01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:36.205
and keep students on their toes,

948
01:16:36.205 --> 01:16:39.365
but bringing a lot of different things to not add something

949
01:16:39.485 --> 01:16:41.605
to their plate, but really enrich the

950
01:16:41.605 --> 01:16:42.725
education they're already getting.

951
01:16:43.545 --> 01:16:45.965
Um, I love ethnic studies and I love talking about it.

952
01:16:46.105 --> 01:16:48.445
Uh, I'm happy to talk more answer questions.

953
01:16:49.185 --> 01:16:50.645
Um, Sherry's gonna close us out,

954
01:16:50.645 --> 01:16:52.565
but I'm happy to answer any questions you have too.

955
01:16:53.405 --> 01:16:54.895
Yeah, go for it. Great.

956
01:16:55.205 --> 01:16:57.455
Well, as you can tell, we are very fortunate

957
01:16:57.455 --> 01:16:59.375
to have the experience

958
01:16:59.555 --> 01:17:02.775
and, um, expertise of Whitney Dwyer, um,

959
01:17:02.955 --> 01:17:05.535
who really spearheaded this work for us, uh,

960
01:17:05.535 --> 01:17:08.615
when the state requirement, um, was put into place.

961
01:17:09.065 --> 01:17:13.565
And also, I hope you can tell, um, students love being in,

962
01:17:13.785 --> 01:17:15.205
uh, Katie Tomb's class.

963
01:17:15.785 --> 01:17:18.125
Um, I would love to be in her class every day.

964
01:17:18.505 --> 01:17:23.165
Um, and, and so, um, she's been a really great, um, uh,

965
01:17:23.185 --> 01:17:25.245
leader in this work as we implement

966
01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:26.925
for the first time here in Dublin.

967
01:17:27.505 --> 01:17:31.765
So next steps for us, uh, we do have already on display, um,

968
01:17:31.865 --> 01:17:33.485
the core instructional materials,

969
01:17:33.485 --> 01:17:35.805
which are listed in the outline that's also attached

970
01:17:35.805 --> 01:17:37.045
to this board agenda item.

971
01:17:37.275 --> 01:17:40.005
They're on display in the, um, office

972
01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:42.445
where we always display materials

973
01:17:42.445 --> 01:17:44.365
that we are submitting for adoption.

974
01:17:44.865 --> 01:17:48.005
Um, and we will be bringing those back to you for adoption,

975
01:17:48.185 --> 01:17:51.485
uh, on October 22nd, when we will also ask

976
01:17:51.505 --> 01:17:53.805
for an action item, which we typically do not do.

977
01:17:53.865 --> 01:17:57.365
Um, it's only because the ED code is re is requiring

978
01:17:57.625 --> 01:17:59.085
for ethnic studies courses

979
01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.365
that the board adopt a course outline.

980
01:18:01.705 --> 01:18:06.085
So we will ask you on October 22nd to adopt the course

981
01:18:06.185 --> 01:18:08.125
of study for ethnic studies one

982
01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:10.405
and also the instructional materials that are listed in

983
01:18:10.405 --> 01:18:11.405
that, in that course.

984
01:18:11.905 --> 01:18:13.485
And we would be happy at this point

985
01:18:13.545 --> 01:18:15.125
to answer any questions you have.

986
01:18:15.345 --> 01:18:16.645
Um, thank you very much.

987
01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:19.525
Anyone have any questions?

988
01:18:22.705 --> 01:18:24.765
Um, trustee spec, trustee Blackman

989
01:18:25.465 --> 01:18:26.465
Of you? Sure.

990
01:18:26.465 --> 01:18:28.605
Um, thank you. Great presentation.

991
01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:31.525
Um, love your passion, Katie. Yeah, that's awesome.

992
01:18:31.765 --> 01:18:34.605
I wanna go take your class too. Great. Come on in. Anytime.

993
01:18:35.005 --> 01:18:39.005
I, I appreciate the thematic approach that you're doing, um,

994
01:18:39.745 --> 01:18:41.525
uh, and the alignment with the universities.

995
01:18:41.665 --> 01:18:43.925
Um, can you talk a little more about the alignment you're

996
01:18:43.925 --> 01:18:45.365
doing with the regional districts?

997
01:18:45.365 --> 01:18:46.725
Like which, um, regions

998
01:18:46.725 --> 01:18:49.205
and like how deep are you getting, um, into it?

999
01:18:49.205 --> 01:18:50.805
Or is it more at a high level?

1000
01:18:50.955 --> 01:18:52.205
Yeah, that's a really good question.

1001
01:18:52.705 --> 01:18:55.365
Uh, one thing that's been really helpful since I'm,

1002
01:18:55.365 --> 01:18:57.485
you know, working on my own in the district, so to speak,

1003
01:18:57.485 --> 01:18:59.285
well, not alone, but working with like, you know,

1004
01:18:59.285 --> 01:19:01.285
I don't have a teacher team yet, um,

1005
01:19:01.865 --> 01:19:03.365
has been these institutes.

1006
01:19:03.365 --> 01:19:06.085
So I've attended a few, uh, starting as far back

1007
01:19:06.085 --> 01:19:07.485
as about a year and a half ago.

1008
01:19:08.025 --> 01:19:10.645
And we get to work with, uh, school partners

1009
01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.765
that are coming from kind of our neighboring districts.

1010
01:19:13.105 --> 01:19:15.605
Um, but then in uc, Davis even further out to kind

1011
01:19:15.605 --> 01:19:16.605
of the Sacramento area.

1012
01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:20.765
And a lot of our topics that are here in these units

1013
01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:24.845
are aligned with major districts across this kind

1014
01:19:24.845 --> 01:19:26.445
of the Bay area and the wider Bay area.

1015
01:19:27.025 --> 01:19:28.765
Um, and so that's been really helpful.

1016
01:19:28.905 --> 01:19:30.285
We can look at each other's syllabi.

1017
01:19:30.285 --> 01:19:33.005
We've shared curricular resources, we're working together.

1018
01:19:33.465 --> 01:19:35.445
And all of this is kind of with the expertise

1019
01:19:35.585 --> 01:19:36.965
of this high school ethnic studies

1020
01:19:36.965 --> 01:19:38.565
institute from the university.

1021
01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:41.565
So it's been nice to like get in the weeds with somebody

1022
01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:43.085
and really work through it.

1023
01:19:43.635 --> 01:19:46.125
Ours has, uh, you know, different unit assessments.

1024
01:19:46.205 --> 01:19:48.805
I think each school is generating a focus

1025
01:19:48.805 --> 01:19:50.605
that's gonna be enriching for their students,

1026
01:19:51.305 --> 01:19:54.085
but I think generally they're following a similar outline

1027
01:19:54.225 --> 01:19:55.245
on the thematic focus.

1028
01:19:55.595 --> 01:19:56.805
Very few schools, some do,

1029
01:19:57.145 --> 01:19:59.645
but very few schools are doing the more, uh, kind

1030
01:19:59.645 --> 01:20:01.485
of core four group focused

1031
01:20:01.515 --> 01:20:03.885
because of California's diversity in the,

1032
01:20:03.945 --> 01:20:05.085
the diversity in our schools.

1033
01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:06.805
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1034
01:20:07.305 --> 01:20:09.805
Um, what, do we have a certain credential

1035
01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.525
that the teachers have to have to teach this class?

1036
01:20:11.745 --> 01:20:13.365
That's a great question. As of right now,

1037
01:20:13.395 --> 01:20:14.565
it's a history credential

1038
01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:16.285
or social science credential that's needed.

1039
01:20:16.465 --> 01:20:19.405
So I, uh, you know, I'm all credentialed up.

1040
01:20:19.485 --> 01:20:21.165
I got my English and my history ready to go.

1041
01:20:21.665 --> 01:20:24.885
Um, but I think there is in the works an idea

1042
01:20:24.885 --> 01:20:26.445
for an ethnic studies credential

1043
01:20:26.445 --> 01:20:29.645
because much of what I took on my history credential test

1044
01:20:29.665 --> 01:20:31.925
and in the pedagogy class doesn't apply here.

1045
01:20:32.265 --> 01:20:34.765
And so I do think that'll be coming down in the next year

1046
01:20:34.765 --> 01:20:36.765
or two is like a further credential process.

1047
01:20:36.945 --> 01:20:38.605
But right now it would be a social science

1048
01:20:38.605 --> 01:20:39.645
credential. Yeah. Okay.

1049
01:20:39.645 --> 01:20:42.245
Social science. And then, um, I like the student who

1050
01:20:42.915 --> 01:20:45.445
mentioned, um, would need to be broader.

1051
01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:46.805
And I guess that's ethnic studies too.

1052
01:20:46.865 --> 01:20:48.365
Do we have an ethnic studies too?

1053
01:20:48.535 --> 01:20:51.245
There are dreams. Okay. Uh, there are dreams.

1054
01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:54.285
Uh, I think generally at the high school, I believe,

1055
01:20:54.445 --> 01:20:56.565
I don't wanna speak, but I think believe at the high school

1056
01:20:56.565 --> 01:20:58.005
level, there is a drive

1057
01:20:58.025 --> 01:21:00.925
to maybe submit a few additional one semester courses

1058
01:21:01.105 --> 01:21:03.085
to fit well with ethnic studies one.

1059
01:21:03.385 --> 01:21:05.685
But in ethnic studies, two elective could be added.

1060
01:21:06.225 --> 01:21:08.005
And I think, you know, this is, you know,

1061
01:21:08.005 --> 01:21:09.165
in the planning stage,

1062
01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:11.645
but I think it really focuses on additional community

1063
01:21:11.645 --> 01:21:14.645
engagement or maybe even like a semester long student chose

1064
01:21:14.645 --> 01:21:17.365
project in which they're examining an issue in their

1065
01:21:17.365 --> 01:21:19.165
community or looking at a way

1066
01:21:19.165 --> 01:21:21.045
to contribute, I think in some ways.

1067
01:21:21.225 --> 01:21:22.325
Action. Yeah. Please,

1068
01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:24.005
can I just add a Please, please, please. Sorry,

1069
01:21:24.125 --> 01:21:26.925
I just wanna remind the board, you did actually approve an

1070
01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:30.365
ethnic studies two course in 2022 when we brought you the

1071
01:21:30.565 --> 01:21:33.125
original recommendation for ethnic story studies One.

1072
01:21:33.345 --> 01:21:34.685
So it's already on the books.

1073
01:21:34.785 --> 01:21:36.245
We just haven't developed the course yet

1074
01:21:36.245 --> 01:21:38.965
because there hasn't been, um, the demand yet.

1075
01:21:39.465 --> 01:21:41.885
Um, but that will happen as you can see. So yeah,

1076
01:21:41.945 --> 01:21:45.885
So as the, as students are taking the one as requirement,

1077
01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:46.925
they could sign up for two

1078
01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:49.725
and that could be the same year back to back, uh,

1079
01:21:49.825 --> 01:21:52.485
or it could be perhaps over two different years they could

1080
01:21:52.485 --> 01:21:53.725
pair it with financial literacy

1081
01:21:53.725 --> 01:21:55.205
or any other number of like half

1082
01:21:55.265 --> 01:21:58.365
or semester long courses too. Yeah. Okay.

1083
01:21:58.485 --> 01:22:01.325
Great. And my last question, um, this is focused

1084
01:22:01.505 --> 01:22:02.925
for grades 10 through 12.

1085
01:22:03.105 --> 01:22:06.645
Yes, ma'am. Um, I know freshmen have a very specific classes

1086
01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.765
there to take and so there's rarely room.

1087
01:22:08.825 --> 01:22:10.125
Yep. But let's say there was

1088
01:22:10.165 --> 01:22:11.365
a freshman who wanted to take it.

1089
01:22:11.625 --> 01:22:14.805
Um, are we saying it's for 10th through 12th from a maturity

1090
01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:17.725
of the student standpoint or because of schedule fit?

1091
01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:19.045
Would a freshman be allowed to take it?

1092
01:22:19.155 --> 01:22:21.285
It's a good freshman. You can start. Yeah, go ahead.

1093
01:22:21.285 --> 01:22:22.285
And then I can add on.

1094
01:22:23.165 --> 01:22:26.345
Um, so it was like a whole year long process even coming

1095
01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:27.985
up with the idea of ethnic studies.

1096
01:22:28.165 --> 01:22:29.785
And so it was in curriculum council

1097
01:22:29.885 --> 01:22:32.465
and in those conversations we decided it would be best

1098
01:22:32.465 --> 01:22:36.105
to go 10 12 to not overload our ninth graders.

1099
01:22:36.205 --> 01:22:38.545
So it really is designed 10, 12,

1100
01:22:38.685 --> 01:22:39.945
and I worked really strongly

1101
01:22:40.015 --> 01:22:42.225
with our contemporary health team to make sure

1102
01:22:42.225 --> 01:22:44.785
that they are embedding ethnic studies, ideas,

1103
01:22:45.205 --> 01:22:48.975
and um, ideas.

1104
01:22:49.975 --> 01:22:52.015
Identity. Thank you. Yeah. And themes. Themes.

1105
01:22:52.365 --> 01:22:53.375
That was the word I was looking for.

1106
01:22:53.515 --> 01:22:56.735
Themes around identity so that they can then build off of

1107
01:22:56.735 --> 01:22:58.055
that when they go into ethnic studies.

1108
01:22:58.245 --> 01:22:59.815
Okay. So it sounds like it is kind of a mix

1109
01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:02.135
of we do want them to be older, we want them to have taken

1110
01:23:02.165 --> 01:23:05.445
that, that first class, um, for the health class and then,

1111
01:23:05.785 --> 01:23:07.285
and then also be older

1112
01:23:07.345 --> 01:23:09.285
and a little more mature and ready to take it.

1113
01:23:09.435 --> 01:23:10.925
Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you.

1114
01:23:12.315 --> 01:23:13.965
Cool. Jesse, black questions.

1115
01:23:14.645 --> 01:23:15.685
I thank you for the presentation.

1116
01:23:15.765 --> 01:23:16.765
I know I've been asking for this

1117
01:23:16.765 --> 01:23:17.805
to come back, I think for a while.

1118
01:23:17.825 --> 01:23:19.165
So I think it's been out there for about a year

1119
01:23:19.165 --> 01:23:20.605
to see more about what's being developed.

1120
01:23:20.605 --> 01:23:22.405
So I do appreciate it. And I wanna second,

1121
01:23:22.505 --> 01:23:24.885
as a trustee spec had mentioned your enthusiasm.

1122
01:23:24.955 --> 01:23:26.445
It's really electric and I can imagine

1123
01:23:26.505 --> 01:23:28.245
how wonderful it is in the classroom with the students.

1124
01:23:28.305 --> 01:23:29.965
So I appreciate the enthusiasm.

1125
01:23:30.685 --> 01:23:31.725
I just wanna bring a couple things

1126
01:23:31.725 --> 01:23:33.205
that you mentioned that I think would be important.

1127
01:23:33.385 --> 01:23:35.325
Um, and that is the translation.

1128
01:23:35.325 --> 01:23:36.605
There's a lot of terminology in here

1129
01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:38.085
and we're asking the public to actually

1130
01:23:38.085 --> 01:23:39.165
give us some feedback and comments.

1131
01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:41.685
And I can tell you for a fact, they can understand a law

1132
01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:43.205
of the terms that are in this document.

1133
01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.605
So I know you wanna bring it back October 22nd,

1134
01:23:45.665 --> 01:23:48.485
but I would actually ask that you actually provide like a

1135
01:23:48.485 --> 01:23:50.685
full disclosure of definitions of some of the terms here.

1136
01:23:50.685 --> 01:23:52.765
So the public can just even read the document, understand

1137
01:23:52.765 --> 01:23:53.725
what they're reading, and then

1138
01:23:53.725 --> 01:23:54.765
bring it back at a later date.

1139
01:23:54.765 --> 01:23:56.645
Because I actually think there won't be very many public

1140
01:23:56.845 --> 01:23:58.805
comments on this because I don't think many people can

1141
01:23:58.965 --> 01:24:00.205
actually understand what it's saying.

1142
01:24:00.985 --> 01:24:03.565
So I think if we wanna be trans transparent, we need

1143
01:24:03.565 --> 01:24:05.445
to provide a supplemental document to this.

1144
01:24:05.445 --> 01:24:07.365
That actually translates some of the terminology

1145
01:24:07.365 --> 01:24:08.445
that you're very familiar with.

1146
01:24:08.685 --> 01:24:10.325
I understand. And, and Whitney is,

1147
01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:12.645
but I think that the public in general will not be,

1148
01:24:12.665 --> 01:24:13.805
so that would be helpful for them.

1149
01:24:14.265 --> 01:24:16.805
Um, one of the things I wanna also ask is,

1150
01:24:16.965 --> 01:24:19.125
I know there there was a discussion about the

1151
01:24:19.405 --> 01:24:20.565
Core four mm-Hmm.

1152
01:24:20.645 --> 01:24:21.685
And one of the things that, um,

1153
01:24:21.885 --> 01:24:25.205
I believe new Simon is second, he first rejected it

1154
01:24:25.205 --> 01:24:28.165
and then he finally signed and approved this to go forward.

1155
01:24:28.705 --> 01:24:31.565
But one of the criticism was that it was, uh, too narrow

1156
01:24:31.745 --> 01:24:32.925
and it wasn't as inclusive.

1157
01:24:33.425 --> 01:24:35.045
And one of the charges that was given to each

1158
01:24:35.045 --> 01:24:36.645
of the communities was to actually shape

1159
01:24:36.645 --> 01:24:38.365
it for your community.

1160
01:24:38.505 --> 01:24:39.885
And I know that we have the Core four,

1161
01:24:39.905 --> 01:24:41.845
but we are an incredibly diverse community here.

1162
01:24:41.865 --> 01:24:44.685
And I'm not seeing the diversity reflected in this material.

1163
01:24:45.345 --> 01:24:46.805
And I do feel for some students,

1164
01:24:46.805 --> 01:24:48.845
they're being required to take this course.

1165
01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:51.965
They will not find the course actually reflects them

1166
01:24:52.425 --> 01:24:54.005
or that they can actually connect

1167
01:24:54.025 --> 01:24:55.805
to the material themselves.

1168
01:24:56.385 --> 01:24:59.125
So I think we have a bit of a challenge here in that we need

1169
01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:01.645
to start to maybe look at not just the core four,

1170
01:25:01.705 --> 01:25:03.485
but also expanding and broadening it.

1171
01:25:03.485 --> 01:25:05.845
I'll give you an example. Uh, in the last year,

1172
01:25:05.965 --> 01:25:08.125
I have actually engaged with many families who are Russian

1173
01:25:08.385 --> 01:25:10.325
and Ukrainian, uh, descent,

1174
01:25:10.325 --> 01:25:12.205
some who've been here in the district for over 10 years,

1175
01:25:12.205 --> 01:25:13.685
some who've just moved here to the war,

1176
01:25:14.305 --> 01:25:16.325
but they don't see themselves obviously

1177
01:25:16.325 --> 01:25:17.405
in some of our curriculum.

1178
01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:19.005
Mm-Hmm. But this would be a great opportunity

1179
01:25:19.025 --> 01:25:20.285
to actually express some

1180
01:25:20.285 --> 01:25:22.525
of the things the Russian community has been in Kenne

1181
01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:24.365
and, um, California for a very long time,

1182
01:25:24.785 --> 01:25:25.805
but they're not shown here.

1183
01:25:26.385 --> 01:25:29.245
Um, so I actually would like to see this come back

1184
01:25:29.275 --> 01:25:33.365
with a way to broaden the information so

1185
01:25:33.365 --> 01:25:35.045
that all students can see themselves.

1186
01:25:35.625 --> 01:25:39.405
Um, one other challenge I'm gonna give you, which I

1187
01:25:39.405 --> 01:25:40.485
Felt, well, I'm sorry,

1188
01:25:40.485 --> 01:25:42.765
but can we, can you let her respond to that?

1189
01:25:42.765 --> 01:25:43.605
Oh, sorry, please. Before the next

1190
01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:45.565
challenge so it doesn't get lost. No, that's

1191
01:25:45.565 --> 01:25:46.565
Okay. Thank you. Please. I

1192
01:25:46.565 --> 01:25:46.925
wrote down the,

1193
01:25:46.965 --> 01:25:48.005
I wrote down the part about the definition,

1194
01:25:48.005 --> 01:25:49.125
so I wrote that down for sure.

1195
01:25:49.705 --> 01:25:51.765
And then, um, I think one thing,

1196
01:25:51.945 --> 01:25:54.365
so the multiple perspectives part is really important.

1197
01:25:54.925 --> 01:25:56.885
I think the guidance that I'm kind of taking

1198
01:25:57.825 --> 01:26:00.205
is coming from the model curriculum, here's

1199
01:26:00.205 --> 01:26:01.605
how they negotiate the balance.

1200
01:26:01.665 --> 01:26:04.005
And I agree with you, it is incredibly difficult

1201
01:26:04.465 --> 01:26:06.685
to think about a course on ethnicity and race.

1202
01:26:07.265 --> 01:26:08.965
How can it be inclusive of everyone?

1203
01:26:09.465 --> 01:26:12.885
Um, and so generally they say that we're working towards

1204
01:26:13.395 --> 01:26:16.925
greater inclusivity due to the curricular time constraints.

1205
01:26:16.995 --> 01:26:18.245
Difficult choices will have

1206
01:26:18.245 --> 01:26:19.845
to be made at the district and classroom level.

1207
01:26:20.465 --> 01:26:22.485
Uh, it should devote special emphasis

1208
01:26:22.485 --> 01:26:25.445
to the foundational disciplines while making connections

1209
01:26:25.585 --> 01:26:27.365
to the varying experiences of all students.

1210
01:26:27.905 --> 01:26:30.285
And I think one of the ways that I did that in

1211
01:26:30.825 --> 01:26:34.325
the pilot course is promoting projects

1212
01:26:34.325 --> 01:26:37.325
and assignments that really are driven by student inquiry.

1213
01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:42.805
And so having a course list that is deeply inclusive of it,

1214
01:26:42.805 --> 01:26:44.565
and I know this is both with a social science teacher,

1215
01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:48.045
and as a a, a literacy teacher, finding a book

1216
01:26:48.045 --> 01:26:50.845
that every student can see themselves in is very difficult.

1217
01:26:51.265 --> 01:26:54.325
And so, and students can feel left out, it is something

1218
01:26:54.325 --> 01:26:56.485
that happens, happens in our classrooms all the time.

1219
01:26:57.165 --> 01:27:00.085
I think our job then is to make sure that the material

1220
01:27:00.085 --> 01:27:02.405
that we provide is both a window and a mirror.

1221
01:27:02.635 --> 01:27:03.965
Sometimes it is a mirror.

1222
01:27:04.345 --> 01:27:06.205
It is a way for students to see themselves

1223
01:27:06.385 --> 01:27:08.085
and sometimes it is a window for them

1224
01:27:08.085 --> 01:27:09.405
to see into another world

1225
01:27:09.905 --> 01:27:12.445
and make connections back on themselves.

1226
01:27:13.105 --> 01:27:15.165
So I think a lot of the ways that I want to do

1227
01:27:15.165 --> 01:27:16.765
that in this course is make sure

1228
01:27:17.045 --> 01:27:19.925
that students have the option to elicit some student choice,

1229
01:27:20.585 --> 01:27:22.405
so that in their oral history project,

1230
01:27:22.915 --> 01:27:24.565
when they're doing a family interview

1231
01:27:24.665 --> 01:27:26.765
and they're talking about factors of movement,

1232
01:27:27.385 --> 01:27:29.645
how do humans move across this planet

1233
01:27:29.705 --> 01:27:31.165
and why I feel like those Russian

1234
01:27:31.225 --> 01:27:33.725
and Ukrainian students could do a really beautiful project

1235
01:27:33.985 --> 01:27:36.725
of talking to their families and,

1236
01:27:36.865 --> 01:27:39.965
and documenting those stories in a way that would be,

1237
01:27:40.245 --> 01:27:42.245
I think, powerful for our classroom to hear.

1238
01:27:42.785 --> 01:27:44.605
So I think the balance is, yes,

1239
01:27:44.765 --> 01:27:46.725
I don't think the course outline will ever have

1240
01:27:47.335 --> 01:27:48.925
every box ticked,

1241
01:27:49.265 --> 01:27:51.205
but I do think that our projects can make sure

1242
01:27:51.205 --> 01:27:54.605
that students can find those moments of connection to like,

1243
01:27:55.105 --> 01:27:57.925
see themselves and sometimes see themselves in someone who

1244
01:27:58.495 --> 01:28:00.525
isn't of their same race or ethnicity.

1245
01:28:00.605 --> 01:28:02.125
I think that moment is really important too.

1246
01:28:02.585 --> 01:28:03.765
But I, I hear your concern.

1247
01:28:03.925 --> 01:28:07.085
I think it's about making sure that we adapt our course to,

1248
01:28:07.105 --> 01:28:08.605
to be reflective as much as possible.

1249
01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.125
Can I add a little bit to that? Sure.

1250
01:28:10.425 --> 01:28:12.765
Um, I just wanted to point out again

1251
01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:15.085
that when we first started deciding how

1252
01:28:15.105 --> 01:28:16.245
to structure this course,

1253
01:28:16.445 --> 01:28:17.725
I think it was Whitney actually Mm-Hmm.

1254
01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:21.085
Who first brought to our attention, um, the distinction

1255
01:28:21.085 --> 01:28:24.245
between teaching the traditional core four, uh,

1256
01:28:24.345 --> 01:28:27.445
and then also a more fluid kind of thematic approach.

1257
01:28:27.445 --> 01:28:30.245
And as you can see from the slide that's, um, um,

1258
01:28:30.245 --> 01:28:33.325
displayed right now, if you look at the unit titles, um,

1259
01:28:33.325 --> 01:28:35.805
they're not tied to a particular ethnicity.

1260
01:28:36.065 --> 01:28:39.125
Uh, so it is our intention for the course to be reflective

1261
01:28:39.145 --> 01:28:42.165
of the community and be fluid in the sense

1262
01:28:42.165 --> 01:28:45.845
that it will always be able to be adapted to meet the needs

1263
01:28:45.845 --> 01:28:47.725
of the students who are sitting in the classroom at

1264
01:28:47.725 --> 01:28:48.885
the time that they're taking it.

1265
01:28:49.345 --> 01:28:53.005
So, um, you'll see there are core instructional materials

1266
01:28:53.005 --> 01:28:54.245
that were carefully selected,

1267
01:28:54.585 --> 01:28:55.845
but there's also an opportunity

1268
01:28:55.845 --> 01:28:58.085
to use supplemental materials that are reflective

1269
01:28:58.085 --> 01:29:00.205
of the needs of the students and the ethnicities

1270
01:29:00.225 --> 01:29:02.285
and backgrounds of the students who are in the,

1271
01:29:02.385 --> 01:29:04.005
in the course at that particular time.

1272
01:29:04.145 --> 01:29:06.205
So we expect it to be very adaptive

1273
01:29:06.425 --> 01:29:07.685
for our student population.

1274
01:29:08.905 --> 01:29:10.925
That's great to know. Thank you. Uh, it really helps.

1275
01:29:11.305 --> 01:29:14.925
So I'm gonna give you then a, a converse position, which is

1276
01:29:14.925 --> 01:29:16.485
that it was heartbreaking to actually hear,

1277
01:29:16.485 --> 01:29:17.725
this was actually several years ago.

1278
01:29:17.745 --> 01:29:19.005
One of our staff members came up

1279
01:29:19.025 --> 01:29:21.605
and it was a discussion about some of our data sets

1280
01:29:21.635 --> 01:29:23.685
that we ask families to fill out.

1281
01:29:23.905 --> 01:29:25.565
And they always have to check a box. Mm-Hmm.

1282
01:29:25.785 --> 01:29:29.525
And her response was, I am more than one box. Yeah.

1283
01:29:29.535 --> 01:29:31.965
Which one do I pick? And we've seen that the,

1284
01:29:32.345 --> 01:29:34.405
the data is starting to lean more towards more

1285
01:29:34.405 --> 01:29:37.365
and more people are are many things not one thing.

1286
01:29:37.365 --> 01:29:38.885
Mm-Hmm. Um, I always found,

1287
01:29:39.025 --> 01:29:40.245
and at that time I brought up

1288
01:29:40.245 --> 01:29:43.125
that was always challenging when we do the, um, the sort

1289
01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:44.725
of round Thanksgiving time, the sort of,

1290
01:29:44.725 --> 01:29:46.045
let's do some community kind

1291
01:29:46.045 --> 01:29:47.925
of meal bring your cultural dish.

1292
01:29:48.465 --> 01:29:51.365
And for many students it's actually really, um,

1293
01:29:51.865 --> 01:29:52.885
in a way it's marginalizing

1294
01:29:52.885 --> 01:29:55.285
because they don't have a cultural dish.

1295
01:29:56.275 --> 01:29:58.285
They have been mixed and married

1296
01:29:58.385 --> 01:30:00.445
and intermarried with so many different cultures

1297
01:30:00.445 --> 01:30:03.085
that they don't identify with any culture anymore.

1298
01:30:03.745 --> 01:30:05.765
So how do we address those students

1299
01:30:05.795 --> 01:30:08.405
that they don't feel like, I understand some

1300
01:30:08.405 --> 01:30:11.525
of the material in this course is about addressing these

1301
01:30:11.525 --> 01:30:13.445
different aspects that we want them to understand

1302
01:30:13.445 --> 01:30:16.085
with different cultures, but what do we do for students that

1303
01:30:16.935 --> 01:30:19.005
don't see that anymore in themselves?

1304
01:30:19.005 --> 01:30:20.045
Yeah. They don't have that.

1305
01:30:20.595 --> 01:30:22.565
Your example from, uh, the person

1306
01:30:22.565 --> 01:30:24.965
that you shared is actually like one of my favorite lessons,

1307
01:30:25.135 --> 01:30:27.685
which is when I bring in a copy of the us census

1308
01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:30.805
and we look at the boxes that people are asked to check

1309
01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.925
together and without instruction, we look at it

1310
01:30:34.025 --> 01:30:36.565
and we sit in that discomfort.

1311
01:30:36.955 --> 01:30:38.205
What, what would I check?

1312
01:30:38.585 --> 01:30:40.285
How would, how would I answer this?

1313
01:30:40.825 --> 01:30:42.445
How would my family answer this question?

1314
01:30:42.985 --> 01:30:44.125
And we sit in that for a moment

1315
01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:47.125
and then we talk about where did these ideas come from.

1316
01:30:47.465 --> 01:30:49.485
The idea here is really to complicate that narrative.

1317
01:30:49.525 --> 01:30:51.525
I think that you're saying that we are more than one box.

1318
01:30:52.085 --> 01:30:54.965
I think you're tapping into maybe some of those ideas

1319
01:30:54.965 --> 01:30:56.805
that we're hoping students arrive at.

1320
01:30:57.425 --> 01:30:59.205
Um, and so the goal,

1321
01:30:59.305 --> 01:31:01.325
at least when my teaching is really constructivist,

1322
01:31:01.465 --> 01:31:02.725
can we start with a question

1323
01:31:03.505 --> 01:31:05.725
and work through it, problematize it,

1324
01:31:05.785 --> 01:31:08.005
and then have students draw that conclusion as much

1325
01:31:08.005 --> 01:31:10.765
as possible that I think you drew from that conversation.

1326
01:31:11.225 --> 01:31:13.325
But yeah, I think you're right. The idea of mixed identity,

1327
01:31:13.335 --> 01:31:16.805
mixed race identity, mixed race ethnicities is powerful.

1328
01:31:17.225 --> 01:31:19.045
Uh, a lot of our students might be coming from

1329
01:31:19.675 --> 01:31:21.885
multinational homes, binational homes,

1330
01:31:21.975 --> 01:31:23.645
first generation, second generation.

1331
01:31:24.265 --> 01:31:26.685
And I think it's finding the language for that student

1332
01:31:26.945 --> 01:31:28.005
to express themselves,

1333
01:31:28.095 --> 01:31:31.365
which might be different necessarily from their sibling

1334
01:31:31.465 --> 01:31:32.725
or from their family member,

1335
01:31:33.345 --> 01:31:35.605
but giving them options, stories

1336
01:31:36.265 --> 01:31:39.325
and examples from class to be able to start to figure out

1337
01:31:39.745 --> 01:31:42.245
how do I say who I am and where I identify myself.

1338
01:31:42.265 --> 01:31:44.925
So yeah, I would expect students to come in probably

1339
01:31:44.925 --> 01:31:48.605
with some questions first and then try to move from there.

1340
01:31:48.785 --> 01:31:51.285
But I think we are trying to like lean slightly away from

1341
01:31:51.285 --> 01:31:52.805
just multicultural education.

1342
01:31:53.075 --> 01:31:55.285
Everybody carries a flag and that's who we are.

1343
01:31:55.665 --> 01:31:58.125
And really like complicate that notion like you're saying.

1344
01:31:58.505 --> 01:31:59.605
Um, 'cause I think some

1345
01:31:59.605 --> 01:32:01.605
of the takeaways you're pointing at would be takeaways.

1346
01:32:01.625 --> 01:32:03.525
I'd be hopeful students would take from that class.

1347
01:32:04.235 --> 01:32:05.385
Thank you so much. I really

1348
01:32:05.385 --> 01:32:06.505
do appreciate your explanation.

1349
01:32:06.505 --> 01:32:08.585
It shows that you really understand the complexity of some

1350
01:32:08.585 --> 01:32:09.785
of this issue for some of our students.

1351
01:32:09.785 --> 01:32:11.705
Yeah. The last one that I wanna bring up is

1352
01:32:11.705 --> 01:32:13.665
that I've actually had several parents reach out

1353
01:32:13.765 --> 01:32:18.115
and actually, um, new parents who actually

1354
01:32:18.115 --> 01:32:20.795
through their process in coming to the United States left

1355
01:32:20.795 --> 01:32:24.115
because they don't wanna be associated with what they left.

1356
01:32:24.845 --> 01:32:27.575
They feel it's harmful and they wanna be seen

1357
01:32:27.595 --> 01:32:30.055
as Americans without the identity of

1358
01:32:30.055 --> 01:32:31.895
where they came from being plastered on them.

1359
01:32:32.475 --> 01:32:34.215
And I do believe there's such a large number

1360
01:32:34.235 --> 01:32:36.295
of immigrants here in this community need

1361
01:32:36.295 --> 01:32:37.775
to be very sensitive to that

1362
01:32:38.485 --> 01:32:40.495
because for some of us who've been here

1363
01:32:40.515 --> 01:32:42.855
and we subscribe ourselves around these identities

1364
01:32:42.855 --> 01:32:43.935
because we feel comfortable with them,

1365
01:32:44.405 --> 01:32:46.375
some people actually fled places

1366
01:32:46.995 --> 01:32:48.975
and they don't wanna be associated with them at all.

1367
01:32:49.115 --> 01:32:50.855
So we need to also, I would hope

1368
01:32:50.855 --> 01:32:52.255
that in developing the course

1369
01:32:52.255 --> 01:32:55.135
that you're thinking about the sensitivity of some

1370
01:32:55.135 --> 01:32:57.295
of those students who their experience have been so harsh,

1371
01:32:57.325 --> 01:32:59.695
they don't wanna be associated with that identity.

1372
01:32:59.835 --> 01:33:00.975
So as much as you can,

1373
01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:01.975
hopefully you'll just work

1374
01:33:01.975 --> 01:33:03.255
that in somehow. Yes. Thank you. Yeah,

1375
01:33:03.255 --> 01:33:05.375
I think being as trauma informed and,

1376
01:33:05.515 --> 01:33:06.775
and centered in that.

1377
01:33:06.775 --> 01:33:07.775
Yeah, that's a great point.

1378
01:33:08.855 --> 01:33:10.155
All right. Any other questions? We have

1379
01:33:10.155 --> 01:33:11.315
one public comment.

1380
01:33:12.495 --> 01:33:14.755
Go ahead and take that now and then we can go from there.

1381
01:33:14.785 --> 01:33:17.275
Okay. We'll have one public comment, uh, virtually

1382
01:33:17.495 --> 01:33:19.475
and as in an anonymous parent.

1383
01:33:19.655 --> 01:33:20.655
Go ahead please.

1384
01:33:25.205 --> 01:33:26.995
Hello everyone. Thank you so much

1385
01:33:27.015 --> 01:33:28.555
for the wonderful presentation.

1386
01:33:28.955 --> 01:33:32.115
'cause um, as a parent, I had been waiting for some kind

1387
01:33:32.175 --> 01:33:35.315
of information regarding this ethnic studies course

1388
01:33:35.545 --> 01:33:37.955
that will be a requirement now.

1389
01:33:38.575 --> 01:33:41.075
Um, my first, uh, question

1390
01:33:41.075 --> 01:33:43.235
that I would really want the district

1391
01:33:43.335 --> 01:33:45.835
and the ethnic studies team to ponder over

1392
01:33:45.935 --> 01:33:48.035
and then share with the community would be

1393
01:33:48.425 --> 01:33:51.355
regarding the fact that ethnic studies course would be a

1394
01:33:51.555 --> 01:33:54.235
semester long course, whereas most other courses

1395
01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:57.435
that high schoolers have are year long courses.

1396
01:33:58.095 --> 01:33:59.155
So how are you planning

1397
01:33:59.215 --> 01:34:01.795
to incorporate it in the schedule such that,

1398
01:34:01.795 --> 01:34:02.955
that it's not impacted?

1399
01:34:03.105 --> 01:34:07.035
Like earlier, I know, um, for, uh, high school,

1400
01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:08.515
they had the freshman seminar

1401
01:34:08.695 --> 01:34:10.435
and they had health as semester courses.

1402
01:34:10.615 --> 01:34:13.235
And now for say EHS, they have combined

1403
01:34:13.235 --> 01:34:16.075
and make, make the Contemporary Health course.

1404
01:34:16.135 --> 01:34:17.275
That's a year long,

1405
01:34:17.575 --> 01:34:19.955
but there are very, very few electives also

1406
01:34:19.955 --> 01:34:22.995
that are semester long and many don't end up taking those.

1407
01:34:23.535 --> 01:34:27.195
So, um, that is one question I have that as a group,

1408
01:34:27.215 --> 01:34:30.155
if you can discuss, how are you planning to incorporate that

1409
01:34:30.255 --> 01:34:33.395
and then share more information with the parent community.

1410
01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:36.515
'cause as parents, we are, uh, quite concerned of

1411
01:34:36.615 --> 01:34:40.515
how it would be, um, adjusted with the year long courses,

1412
01:34:40.745 --> 01:34:42.715
both mandatory and electives.

1413
01:34:43.215 --> 01:34:46.795
Um, and then are you like, collaborate, collaborating with,

1414
01:34:46.895 --> 01:34:49.715
uh, nearby neighboring school districts

1415
01:34:49.715 --> 01:34:52.755
and trying to find out if they have already implemented it

1416
01:34:52.775 --> 01:34:54.075
and how they have done it

1417
01:34:54.135 --> 01:34:57.155
so we can learn from their successes or failures

1418
01:34:58.265 --> 01:35:01.965
and, uh, maybe to incorporate it in a way that would be, uh,

1419
01:35:02.115 --> 01:35:04.845
best suitable from our schedule's point of view.

1420
01:35:05.305 --> 01:35:08.685
Um, additionally, as a parent, I would really appreciate if,

1421
01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:11.285
uh, more information can be shared, not just

1422
01:35:11.285 --> 01:35:12.765
regarding the semester long part,

1423
01:35:12.765 --> 01:35:14.725
but also regarding the course itself.

1424
01:35:15.385 --> 01:35:17.845
Uh, because I know this is just an outline,

1425
01:35:17.865 --> 01:35:21.205
but the outline obviously cannot give us details of exactly

1426
01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:22.325
what the course is.

1427
01:35:22.705 --> 01:35:25.365
And considering that, um, the ethnic, uh,

1428
01:35:25.365 --> 01:35:29.325
studies team would be bringing this up for a board board,

1429
01:35:29.505 --> 01:35:32.125
um, on October 22nd, which is very soon,

1430
01:35:32.565 --> 01:35:35.245
I think if the community can get details of

1431
01:35:35.245 --> 01:35:37.285
what exactly this course is gonna be about,

1432
01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:40.085
is it gonna have historic, um, events

1433
01:35:40.185 --> 01:35:43.285
and how it's gonna take into consideration the diversity

1434
01:35:43.435 --> 01:35:44.765
that our community has.

1435
01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:47.685
I think all that would be really helpful. Thank you so much.

1436
01:35:50.715 --> 01:35:54.415
And I just wanna note in the item on the agenda, there is,

1437
01:35:54.635 --> 01:35:57.575
uh, a further outline that wasn't presented with this,

1438
01:35:57.575 --> 01:35:59.615
that if anyone wants more information that kind of goes

1439
01:35:59.615 --> 01:36:00.975
through the outcomes and,

1440
01:36:00.975 --> 01:36:03.175
and various things that some people wanna do.

1441
01:36:04.035 --> 01:36:05.215
Um, do you wanna,

1442
01:36:05.215 --> 01:36:07.215
does anyone wanna respond on the semester thing?

1443
01:36:07.215 --> 01:36:08.775
I know that was, that has been discussed

1444
01:36:08.775 --> 01:36:11.445
and I know that's kind of, and as juniors

1445
01:36:11.445 --> 01:36:12.485
and seniors, they tend

1446
01:36:12.525 --> 01:36:15.855
to take a couple more semester classes.

1447
01:36:16.235 --> 01:36:18.575
Um, it is correct that this is a semester long

1448
01:36:18.635 --> 01:36:19.695
course requirement.

1449
01:36:19.835 --> 01:36:22.935
Um, as mixed tomb said, one of the options would be

1450
01:36:22.935 --> 01:36:25.575
to take ethnic studies two, which we hope will be, um,

1451
01:36:26.135 --> 01:36:28.295
a desirable, uh, second semester

1452
01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.535
to pair with ethnic studies.

1453
01:36:29.635 --> 01:36:33.455
One. We already have a few, um, semester long courses

1454
01:36:33.755 --> 01:36:35.695
as well available at the high school.

1455
01:36:36.235 --> 01:36:40.575
Um, and there is currently at the state level a lot of, um,

1456
01:36:41.415 --> 01:36:44.935
enthusiasm and, um, excitement around financial literacy.

1457
01:36:44.995 --> 01:36:46.215
So we're thinking that that's going

1458
01:36:46.215 --> 01:36:47.815
to be an excellent pairing with, um,

1459
01:36:48.445 --> 01:36:50.055
with ethnic studies one.

1460
01:36:50.075 --> 01:36:51.575
But we are continuing to look at that

1461
01:36:51.575 --> 01:36:53.975
and how to be sure that everything fits in the schedule.

1462
01:36:53.995 --> 01:36:56.695
So we're not prepared tonight to, to share out sort

1463
01:36:56.695 --> 01:36:58.735
of a new, um, four year plan.

1464
01:36:58.835 --> 01:37:01.255
But we did share a couple of ideas about

1465
01:37:01.475 --> 01:37:04.015
how ethnic studies would fit in under our current, um,

1466
01:37:04.665 --> 01:37:05.815
graduation requirements.

1467
01:37:05.875 --> 01:37:08.295
And we'll come back with additional information about that.

1468
01:37:08.635 --> 01:37:10.255
Um, as we look at, you know,

1469
01:37:10.415 --> 01:37:12.215
changing graduation requirements, I'm assuming

1470
01:37:12.215 --> 01:37:14.895
that would come kind of in that January, February time,

1471
01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:17.095
when all of the, when all the new courses.

1472
01:37:17.095 --> 01:37:18.735
So yes, new courses are coming out.

1473
01:37:18.735 --> 01:37:20.175
We're actually starting that process now.

1474
01:37:20.175 --> 01:37:22.055
It is already time to start thinking about,

1475
01:37:22.235 --> 01:37:23.295
um, new courses for next year.

1476
01:37:23.295 --> 01:37:25.695
Yes. And then when the information goes out to students as

1477
01:37:25.695 --> 01:37:27.215
to what they would be taking

1478
01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:28.975
and what they need to take over the years

1479
01:37:29.035 --> 01:37:31.615
and what their available elective options are, correct,

1480
01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:33.415
we'll work with the counseling staff around that.

1481
01:37:33.815 --> 01:37:35.495
Excellent. Um, trustee Blackman,

1482
01:37:36.015 --> 01:37:37.575
I, I'm glad the topic was brought up.

1483
01:37:37.635 --> 01:37:40.255
So this is brought up, I think back in 2022.

1484
01:37:40.255 --> 01:37:42.415
The question was asked, um, would it be possible

1485
01:37:42.415 --> 01:37:44.335
to offer this course during the summer so

1486
01:37:44.335 --> 01:37:46.895
that it doesn't have the impact for students that

1487
01:37:46.895 --> 01:37:49.655
because of their college pursuits, they're, they have

1488
01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:50.975
to be taking year long courses

1489
01:37:51.195 --> 01:37:54.055
and they wouldn't find a good fit for a half year.

1490
01:37:54.415 --> 01:37:55.485
I know this important class,

1491
01:37:55.545 --> 01:37:56.685
but this allows our students

1492
01:37:56.705 --> 01:37:59.245
to actually also pursue their career goals

1493
01:37:59.245 --> 01:38:00.805
and interests as they're applying to colleges

1494
01:38:00.905 --> 01:38:02.325
and allows 'em to still take this course.

1495
01:38:02.385 --> 01:38:03.965
So at the time, there was no interest,

1496
01:38:03.985 --> 01:38:07.005
but I think it might help us solve some of this, um,

1497
01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:08.605
scheduling concerns.

1498
01:38:08.865 --> 01:38:10.405
So is there any, I don't know if you thought

1499
01:38:10.405 --> 01:38:11.525
of that, but just want question,

1500
01:38:12.305 --> 01:38:15.165
We we can certainly, um, take that under consideration.

1501
01:38:15.195 --> 01:38:17.325
It's not something that we're offering at, at the moment.

1502
01:38:18.755 --> 01:38:21.245
Yeah. The biggest key for something in the summer is do

1503
01:38:21.245 --> 01:38:22.885
you have a qualified instructor that's willing

1504
01:38:22.885 --> 01:38:23.885
to teach in the summertime?

1505
01:38:24.745 --> 01:38:27.245
And that just leads to my, my question comment.

1506
01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:30.245
I, I'm, as we roll this out, obviously

1507
01:38:31.025 --> 01:38:34.005
one amazing teacher can't cover all sections, right?

1508
01:38:34.465 --> 01:38:38.085
Uh, do you know if there's already interest, uh,

1509
01:38:38.175 --> 01:38:41.565
among your colleagues, uh, once it becomes more viable?

1510
01:38:41.865 --> 01:38:43.965
Or is this gonna be a outright

1511
01:38:43.965 --> 01:38:45.445
recruitment? We're gonna have to do the,

1512
01:38:45.625 --> 01:38:46.625
I'm currently recruiting now. Yeah.

1513
01:38:46.625 --> 01:38:49.645
Um, uh, when we did the March PD

1514
01:38:49.995 --> 01:38:53.205
with the social science department, I think my, uh, so,

1515
01:38:53.205 --> 01:38:55.365
you know, secret idea is to really plant some seeds.

1516
01:38:55.365 --> 01:38:56.405
And so we have a couple teachers

1517
01:38:56.405 --> 01:38:57.805
who are excited about pursuing it.

1518
01:38:58.205 --> 01:39:00.005
I think building a team is gonna be important.

1519
01:39:00.465 --> 01:39:01.925
Um, sorry, I'm not speaking the mic.

1520
01:39:01.945 --> 01:39:03.485
And I think the other part is making sure

1521
01:39:03.485 --> 01:39:05.485
that those teachers have the opportunity, like I did,

1522
01:39:05.485 --> 01:39:06.525
to attend some of these like

1523
01:39:06.525 --> 01:39:08.125
university accredited trainings.

1524
01:39:08.665 --> 01:39:11.165
Uh, they're being offered right now for free from the,

1525
01:39:11.275 --> 01:39:12.645
from the ucs, which is amazing.

1526
01:39:13.065 --> 01:39:15.925
So I think a continuing professional development for

1527
01:39:15.925 --> 01:39:17.325
that team is, is essential.

1528
01:39:17.325 --> 01:39:18.725
It's also what's recommended by the state.

1529
01:39:18.745 --> 01:39:21.125
So yeah, I think there's some folks I'm crossing fingers,

1530
01:39:21.505 --> 01:39:22.685
uh, that are excited about it.

1531
01:39:22.785 --> 01:39:25.005
And then balancing that out with how many sections we need.

1532
01:39:25.065 --> 01:39:28.525
I'm curious to see if students are initiating

1533
01:39:28.525 --> 01:39:30.805
and taking at 10th grade if we're gonna have like a large

1534
01:39:30.865 --> 01:39:31.925
number signing up.

1535
01:39:32.265 --> 01:39:35.085
So I think it will wax and wane slightly with signups just

1536
01:39:35.085 --> 01:39:37.525
because students can choose to take it at different years.

1537
01:39:37.715 --> 01:39:38.715
Yeah.

1538
01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:42.555
All right. Jesse Blackman, uh,

1539
01:39:42.555 --> 01:39:44.475
just comment time as opposed to question time.

1540
01:39:44.535 --> 01:39:47.675
So, um, I do appreciate all the information you've provided

1541
01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:49.395
and I know that you're working through some things.

1542
01:39:49.855 --> 01:39:51.355
One of the things that had me a little concern is

1543
01:39:51.355 --> 01:39:52.795
that there was some, in some of the writings,

1544
01:39:52.795 --> 01:39:55.195
there was the allusion to whether it's actually part

1545
01:39:55.195 --> 01:39:56.355
of the courses or the themes,

1546
01:39:56.975 --> 01:40:00.315
but given the recent issues in some of the college campuses

1547
01:40:00.625 --> 01:40:03.995
with, um, protests by students, any references

1548
01:40:04.295 --> 01:40:08.275
or, um, components of the course that basically

1549
01:40:08.855 --> 01:40:10.435
the way I read it, uh, talks about

1550
01:40:10.575 --> 01:40:13.675
and sort of gets students enthused about activism.

1551
01:40:14.275 --> 01:40:16.595
I think being vocal and being aware

1552
01:40:16.855 --> 01:40:18.355
and engaging is one thing.

1553
01:40:18.455 --> 01:40:19.915
But when you see the, some

1554
01:40:19.915 --> 01:40:22.595
of the terminology used in some information about ethnic

1555
01:40:22.595 --> 01:40:26.355
studies, it tends to bring up those images of last year.

1556
01:40:26.455 --> 01:40:29.275
And so I understand that students are very,

1557
01:40:29.415 --> 01:40:30.875
um, impressionable.

1558
01:40:31.795 --> 01:40:33.835
I had a good friend in college that basically went

1559
01:40:33.835 --> 01:40:35.835
and rioted for like, communism in college

1560
01:40:35.975 --> 01:40:38.195
and decades later turn around and said, what was I thinking?

1561
01:40:38.275 --> 01:40:40.075
I was such a fool. I didn't know what I was talking about.

1562
01:40:40.715 --> 01:40:41.795
Students are very impressionable.

1563
01:40:41.975 --> 01:40:45.395
So I would also ask that we be very cautious in how much

1564
01:40:45.395 --> 01:40:46.515
of this we infuse

1565
01:40:47.065 --> 01:40:48.755
because the tendency is

1566
01:40:48.755 --> 01:40:50.315
that they really don't understand the

1567
01:40:50.315 --> 01:40:51.355
complexity of some of the issues.

1568
01:40:51.735 --> 01:40:54.165
And I would hate to have something come out of some

1569
01:40:54.165 --> 01:40:56.965
of our students that would come back

1570
01:40:56.965 --> 01:40:59.005
to Dublin if they were involved in some

1571
01:40:59.005 --> 01:41:00.365
activities similar to other schools.

1572
01:41:00.525 --> 01:41:02.085
I don't want know of our students being thrown off

1573
01:41:02.085 --> 01:41:04.325
of a campus because they think this is what they must do.

1574
01:41:04.525 --> 01:41:05.885
I want them to be able to have a future.

1575
01:41:06.505 --> 01:41:08.845
So as much as we can, I know it's important that they, um,

1576
01:41:08.845 --> 01:41:12.645
take this course, but please as much as you can, um,

1577
01:41:12.645 --> 01:41:13.965
understand that sometimes they do

1578
01:41:13.965 --> 01:41:15.965
understand all of what it means. Thank you.

1579
01:41:16.585 --> 01:41:18.965
Thanks. All right. All right. Thank you.

1580
01:41:19.085 --> 01:41:20.605
I think we're not voting on anything tonight.

1581
01:41:20.605 --> 01:41:22.845
This just information. I really appreciate it if we, the,

1582
01:41:22.845 --> 01:41:26.965
uh, depth of everything all our next one

1583
01:41:27.065 --> 01:41:28.565
is the budget.

1584
01:41:29.835 --> 01:41:33.605
Alright, Chris Hobbs and I are gonna tag team this one.

1585
01:41:33.705 --> 01:41:36.565
Now this is a presentation that, uh, Chris

1586
01:41:36.565 --> 01:41:41.005
and I have done, uh, two, uh, together, uh, live.

1587
01:41:41.265 --> 01:41:43.125
And then one last night virtual.

1588
01:41:43.905 --> 01:41:47.045
Um, so it is the ex exact presentation

1589
01:41:47.065 --> 01:41:48.725
that's been shared three times.

1590
01:41:48.985 --> 01:41:50.725
The one last night was recorded,

1591
01:41:51.225 --> 01:41:54.645
and, uh, once it's edited, it will be posted so that, uh,

1592
01:41:54.705 --> 01:41:58.245
anyone will have access ongoing in the future as well as

1593
01:41:58.245 --> 01:42:01.845
to continue to pro provide us, uh, uh, feedback.

1594
01:42:02.345 --> 01:42:05.685
We are not going to go through the first 21 slides

1595
01:42:06.285 --> 01:42:08.685
'cause this board has seen these slides over

1596
01:42:08.685 --> 01:42:10.085
and over the last couple of years.

1597
01:42:10.785 --> 01:42:14.205
Uh, and so, uh, Chris and I will continue to tag team.

1598
01:42:14.565 --> 01:42:17.445
I do want this to be more of a conversation

1599
01:42:17.955 --> 01:42:20.085
once we get into the specifics.

1600
01:42:20.385 --> 01:42:22.725
So Chris is gonna start us off, uh, remind us

1601
01:42:22.725 --> 01:42:24.325
where we're at, uh,

1602
01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.845
and then I'll talk about some of the proposals

1603
01:42:26.845 --> 01:42:30.325
and what we're asking, uh, the board to do, uh, tonight.

1604
01:42:31.175 --> 01:42:32.405
Thank you Superintendent, funk

1605
01:42:32.405 --> 01:42:33.805
President, Pelham, trustees.

1606
01:42:34.305 --> 01:42:36.485
So the first half of the presentation, as Chris did, was,

1607
01:42:36.505 --> 01:42:39.645
uh, mentioned, was really about trying to give folks an idea

1608
01:42:39.665 --> 01:42:42.805
of how public school finance works in 20 minutes, which is,

1609
01:42:42.825 --> 01:42:45.965
you can appreciate is a, a challenging thing to, uh,

1610
01:42:46.025 --> 01:42:47.325
to get in that time.

1611
01:42:47.345 --> 01:42:49.765
But we ended up at this point in our presentation,

1612
01:42:50.135 --> 01:42:53.285
which is really where the board left off back in May when

1613
01:42:53.285 --> 01:42:55.805
they, um, um, saw our budget presentation

1614
01:42:55.805 --> 01:42:57.485
and in June when the board adopted the budget,

1615
01:42:57.985 --> 01:43:01.485
and that was addressing this need to close a, um,

1616
01:43:01.515 --> 01:43:04.365
ongoing deficit in our unrestricted general fund.

1617
01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:08.605
And this slide is the same slide we presented back in May

1618
01:43:08.605 --> 01:43:11.725
to show what the impact of that hole was going to do

1619
01:43:11.725 --> 01:43:13.405
to us if we didn't make a change.

1620
01:43:14.385 --> 01:43:17.285
And you can see that in 23, 24, we expected to end

1621
01:43:17.285 --> 01:43:19.405
with a significant deficit spend, which we did.

1622
01:43:20.385 --> 01:43:23.805
We brought forward a budget that continued deficit spending

1623
01:43:23.865 --> 01:43:25.045
for 24 25.

1624
01:43:25.585 --> 01:43:27.125
And that got us down to a point

1625
01:43:27.125 --> 01:43:29.365
where we basically were meeting our bare minimum

1626
01:43:29.415 --> 01:43:31.005
3% required reserve.

1627
01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:32.565
And as this board knows,

1628
01:43:32.565 --> 01:43:35.245
that 3% reserve represents about two weeks worth of payroll.

1629
01:43:35.345 --> 01:43:37.485
So it's not a particularly large reserve, even though

1630
01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:40.925
to most of us, $5.9 million would seem like a lot of money

1631
01:43:42.485 --> 01:43:44.105
as we move into 25, 26,

1632
01:43:45.015 --> 01:43:47.395
taking no action would result obviously in

1633
01:43:47.395 --> 01:43:48.475
that reserve going away

1634
01:43:48.475 --> 01:43:50.435
and ultimately for the district to become insolvent.

1635
01:43:50.435 --> 01:43:52.685
So the board did take action back in June

1636
01:43:52.825 --> 01:43:56.885
and passed a resolution asking staff to address that five

1637
01:43:56.885 --> 01:44:00.285
and a half million dollar hole by identifying reductions

1638
01:44:00.285 --> 01:44:01.845
that would get us back to a balanced budget.

1639
01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:04.045
And so that's the work we've been working on

1640
01:44:04.045 --> 01:44:05.445
with our community to collect data

1641
01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:08.365
and input on how we address that gap.

1642
01:44:09.545 --> 01:44:10.605
If we get this five

1643
01:44:10.605 --> 01:44:13.445
and a half million dollars worth of reductions, we end up

1644
01:44:13.445 --> 01:44:16.005
with a budget, again, based on all of our projections

1645
01:44:16.005 --> 01:44:18.845
and assumptions about what we know today to a budget

1646
01:44:18.845 --> 01:44:21.125
that basically is balanced moving forward, which is

1647
01:44:21.125 --> 01:44:22.445
where we ultimately need to be.

1648
01:44:23.065 --> 01:44:25.325
And Chris, if you're someone in the community looking at

1649
01:44:25.325 --> 01:44:26.605
this slide for the first time

1650
01:44:26.785 --> 01:44:29.725
and not having really the context or the explanation.

1651
01:44:29.875 --> 01:44:32.565
Sure. Can you explain why the 5.5 million

1652
01:44:32.665 --> 01:44:33.805
is mentioned twice?

1653
01:44:34.615 --> 01:44:36.405
Great comment. And we, that is something

1654
01:44:36.405 --> 01:44:37.565
that keeps coming up regularly.

1655
01:44:37.905 --> 01:44:39.365
We are not having to cut five

1656
01:44:39.365 --> 01:44:42.125
and a half million dollars each year and another five

1657
01:44:42.125 --> 01:44:43.325
and a half million the next year.

1658
01:44:43.635 --> 01:44:47.245
It's an ongoing savings for making the one one-time red, uh,

1659
01:44:47.675 --> 01:44:49.485
adjustments to reduce that five

1660
01:44:49.485 --> 01:44:50.765
and a half million worth of spending.

1661
01:44:51.435 --> 01:44:54.405
It's really just a math thing that I needed to add it

1662
01:44:54.405 --> 01:44:56.325
to the next column in order to reflect

1663
01:44:56.325 --> 01:44:57.725
that we've gotten those savings.

1664
01:44:59.165 --> 01:45:02.135
Okay. So how are we gonna get there?

1665
01:45:02.405 --> 01:45:05.775
Well, one of the tasks we took on last year was to try

1666
01:45:05.935 --> 01:45:09.415
to think about and figure out what would a super bare bones,

1667
01:45:09.925 --> 01:45:11.655
bare minimum school district look like?

1668
01:45:11.715 --> 01:45:13.735
Not a school district that we want, not a school district

1669
01:45:13.735 --> 01:45:15.415
that we frankly need to cut down to,

1670
01:45:15.915 --> 01:45:18.255
but what would it look like if we got to basically zero?

1671
01:45:18.725 --> 01:45:20.255
Many folks are familiar with the concept

1672
01:45:20.255 --> 01:45:21.415
of zero based budgeting.

1673
01:45:21.755 --> 01:45:23.895
The reality is, is we can't go all the way

1674
01:45:23.895 --> 01:45:25.015
to zero and start over.

1675
01:45:25.515 --> 01:45:27.655
We, we have contracts in place, we have

1676
01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:30.775
to keep the lights on, we have to have gas and water.

1677
01:45:30.955 --> 01:45:33.535
So there are things we really don't have a choice in

1678
01:45:33.535 --> 01:45:34.895
that we must continue to do.

1679
01:45:35.285 --> 01:45:36.455
What does that list look like?

1680
01:45:36.515 --> 01:45:39.215
And so it was, it was as much a mental exercise as anything

1681
01:45:39.215 --> 01:45:40.415
for our leadership team,

1682
01:45:40.915 --> 01:45:44.815
but we came up with a fairly compact list of the things that

1683
01:45:45.485 --> 01:45:47.105
we don't really have much choice in

1684
01:45:47.915 --> 01:45:49.815
the good news from the district's perspective.

1685
01:45:49.835 --> 01:45:51.255
And our community's perspective is

1686
01:45:51.255 --> 01:45:54.295
that we have about $160 million in revenue

1687
01:45:54.475 --> 01:45:57.815
to address this bare minimum set of needs.

1688
01:45:58.235 --> 01:45:59.895
But that bare minimum only costs about

1689
01:45:59.935 --> 01:46:01.855
$120 million to deliver.

1690
01:46:02.435 --> 01:46:05.695
So we still have $40 million to build on top of

1691
01:46:05.695 --> 01:46:07.895
that bare minimum and create the

1692
01:46:07.895 --> 01:46:09.215
programs that we're very used to.

1693
01:46:09.875 --> 01:46:12.655
And that's, I I think good news, frankly, yes, we have

1694
01:46:12.655 --> 01:46:15.135
to make five and a half million dollars worth of reductions

1695
01:46:15.525 --> 01:46:18.375
that gets us to this point where we have a balanced budget.

1696
01:46:18.835 --> 01:46:21.255
So we can't afford to continue spending 45

1697
01:46:21.255 --> 01:46:22.295
and a half billion dollars,

1698
01:46:23.045 --> 01:46:24.945
but we can still spend $40 million

1699
01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:27.265
to make Dublin what we want it to be.

1700
01:46:27.725 --> 01:46:29.145
So we feel like that's really good news.

1701
01:46:29.645 --> 01:46:32.785
Um, even though obviously making reductions is not fun

1702
01:46:32.785 --> 01:46:35.465
for anybody, what have we already done?

1703
01:46:35.855 --> 01:46:38.145
Well, again, this board started taking action last year

1704
01:46:38.365 --> 01:46:41.185
and made reductions for the current budget year

1705
01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:43.585
that allowed us to reduce our spending

1706
01:46:43.605 --> 01:46:46.225
by about $4 million of that.

1707
01:46:46.915 --> 01:46:48.625
Again, most of our budget, and you all know this,

1708
01:46:48.625 --> 01:46:50.300
but our community needs to hear it as well.

1709
01:46:50.355 --> 01:46:52.045
Most of our budget is people. 85.

1710
01:46:52.265 --> 01:46:53.285
84%

1711
01:46:53.285 --> 01:46:56.725
of our total spending in our general fund is spending on

1712
01:46:56.935 --> 01:46:59.165
staff people who work for the district.

1713
01:47:00.105 --> 01:47:02.725
We eliminated six leadership positions at the district

1714
01:47:02.725 --> 01:47:05.245
office, um, that represented about 10%

1715
01:47:05.245 --> 01:47:07.285
of our overall leadership headcount.

1716
01:47:07.985 --> 01:47:11.605
Um, those positions are no longer, um, that's a net number.

1717
01:47:12.545 --> 01:47:15.965
We, uh, closed almost six classified FTE.

1718
01:47:16.105 --> 01:47:17.205
And again to, uh, Mr.

1719
01:47:17.425 --> 01:47:18.805
Y's point earlier, he is absolutely right.

1720
01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:21.605
We talk about FTE in many cases, like in the terms

1721
01:47:21.605 --> 01:47:24.285
of leadership that tends to be, you know, one

1722
01:47:24.285 --> 01:47:25.765
to one relationship between people

1723
01:47:25.865 --> 01:47:27.605
and FTE, but that's not always true.

1724
01:47:28.225 --> 01:47:29.685
Um, and that's definitely the case

1725
01:47:29.685 --> 01:47:30.685
with our classified folks.

1726
01:47:30.685 --> 01:47:31.925
Sometimes that doesn't work out

1727
01:47:31.925 --> 01:47:33.085
to be a one-to-one relationship.

1728
01:47:33.785 --> 01:47:37.245
Um, at the end of the day, after all of the, um, shuffling

1729
01:47:37.245 --> 01:47:39.085
and fallout and some, um,

1730
01:47:39.345 --> 01:47:41.325
moving two different funding sources worked out,

1731
01:47:41.705 --> 01:47:43.885
we ultimately ended up only eliminating, uh,

1732
01:47:43.885 --> 01:47:45.325
three quarters of an FTE.

1733
01:47:45.325 --> 01:47:47.845
That was one individual that was, um, laid off at,

1734
01:47:47.845 --> 01:47:50.725
at the end of that, on the certificated side about

1735
01:47:50.725 --> 01:47:52.165
22 FTE were reduced.

1736
01:47:52.385 --> 01:47:54.685
And again, by the time all the dust settled,

1737
01:47:54.905 --> 01:47:57.205
all the moves had happened, folks had landed in places

1738
01:47:57.205 --> 01:47:58.325
where there were vacancies.

1739
01:47:58.545 --> 01:48:00.645
We ended up with two individuals that were impacted

1740
01:48:00.705 --> 01:48:02.325
for a total of one and a half FTE.

1741
01:48:02.905 --> 01:48:05.405
And then our ed services team did a just a amazing job

1742
01:48:05.405 --> 01:48:07.765
of going in and finding those things that were redundant

1743
01:48:07.865 --> 01:48:10.205
or weren't really providing the value we needed it to,

1744
01:48:10.585 --> 01:48:14.165
and identified about $800,000 worth of reductions in order

1745
01:48:14.165 --> 01:48:16.885
to get the ball rolling on these, uh, these cuts

1746
01:48:16.885 --> 01:48:17.845
that we need to make in order to get

1747
01:48:17.845 --> 01:48:18.925
closer to a balance budget.

1748
01:48:20.935 --> 01:48:24.345
So that's where we've got to today

1749
01:48:24.365 --> 01:48:26.105
and that's what we're implementing right now.

1750
01:48:26.285 --> 01:48:28.665
And so what we're gonna be talking about next is really

1751
01:48:28.665 --> 01:48:30.105
what does next year look like

1752
01:48:30.105 --> 01:48:32.425
and what do we need to do to actually get to that five

1753
01:48:32.425 --> 01:48:34.105
and a half million dollar reduction?

1754
01:48:35.125 --> 01:48:38.185
And so what we did this year was, uh, the leadership team

1755
01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:41.305
identified our biggest buckets, uh,

1756
01:48:41.385 --> 01:48:45.025
that would provide us the biggest bang, uh, for, uh,

1757
01:48:45.135 --> 01:48:46.345
potential reductions.

1758
01:48:46.715 --> 01:48:48.385
These are not recommendations.

1759
01:48:49.035 --> 01:48:53.305
These are possible reductions after multiple conversations.

1760
01:48:54.005 --> 01:48:57.025
Um, we've identified 11.5 million.

1761
01:48:57.705 --> 01:48:59.385
'cause again, what we feel is important,

1762
01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:02.345
what we learned last year was that when staff

1763
01:49:02.895 --> 01:49:05.625
just brings a straight recommendation, we kind

1764
01:49:05.625 --> 01:49:07.265
of box the board into a corner

1765
01:49:07.485 --> 01:49:10.545
and there's not a whole lot of room for the board to adjust,

1766
01:49:10.845 --> 01:49:12.785
uh, to make, uh, suggestions

1767
01:49:12.845 --> 01:49:15.945
or to make recommendations, uh, as well as the community.

1768
01:49:16.405 --> 01:49:18.425
Um, and so what we wanted

1769
01:49:18.425 --> 01:49:22.985
to do was identify 11.5 million in possible reductions so

1770
01:49:22.985 --> 01:49:26.385
that through conversations, uh, through opportunities

1771
01:49:26.725 --> 01:49:29.305
to find other savings, uh,

1772
01:49:29.655 --> 01:49:31.945
that the board actually can come up

1773
01:49:31.945 --> 01:49:35.425
with their best possible solution, uh, when the time comes

1774
01:49:35.605 --> 01:49:37.865
to identify the 5.5 million.

1775
01:49:38.565 --> 01:49:41.705
Uh, so as I go through this list, um,

1776
01:49:41.895 --> 01:49:43.825
what I would like the board to keep in mind,

1777
01:49:44.245 --> 01:49:47.725
if possible tonight if we can come to consensus, uh,

1778
01:49:48.025 --> 01:49:50.205
is potentially finding one, two,

1779
01:49:50.205 --> 01:49:52.605
or three areas where the board says, yes,

1780
01:49:52.635 --> 01:49:53.885
this makes a lot of sense.

1781
01:49:54.305 --> 01:49:58.005
We want staff, uh, to continue to pursue that as part

1782
01:49:58.005 --> 01:50:01.325
of the 5.5, uh, possible reduction.

1783
01:50:01.705 --> 01:50:06.005
Um, and conversely, if there are items on this list

1784
01:50:06.005 --> 01:50:09.045
that you think are untouchable, that are non-negotiables,

1785
01:50:09.045 --> 01:50:10.405
that should not be on the list,

1786
01:50:10.755 --> 01:50:13.165
whether it's a hundred percent of that category

1787
01:50:13.305 --> 01:50:15.525
or a partial part, uh, of that category.

1788
01:50:15.985 --> 01:50:17.365
Uh, for instance, instead

1789
01:50:17.365 --> 01:50:19.885
of it being eight FTE under a particular

1790
01:50:19.885 --> 01:50:20.925
one, it might only be four.

1791
01:50:21.745 --> 01:50:23.845
Um, if you could give, uh,

1792
01:50:23.845 --> 01:50:25.485
if we can have consensus tonight on

1793
01:50:25.485 --> 01:50:27.525
that direction, that does two things.

1794
01:50:27.785 --> 01:50:31.805
One, we lower the 11.5 identified potential cuts,

1795
01:50:32.265 --> 01:50:34.525
and we make a dent into the 5.5.

1796
01:50:34.585 --> 01:50:36.845
So as we get closer and closer, we'll continue

1797
01:50:36.865 --> 01:50:39.445
to gather information from stakeholders on

1798
01:50:39.445 --> 01:50:43.165
what is the most important priorities so that the board has

1799
01:50:43.165 --> 01:50:45.725
that all, all that information when the time comes

1800
01:50:45.745 --> 01:50:48.525
for the board to make the final, final decision, uh,

1801
01:50:48.525 --> 01:50:51.005
and for the staff to give our final recommendation.

1802
01:50:53.005 --> 01:50:55.465
So the first one is increased class size.

1803
01:50:55.645 --> 01:50:57.305
Uh, this is part of the LCAP goal.

1804
01:50:57.365 --> 01:51:00.305
One, particularly around access to curriculum

1805
01:51:00.445 --> 01:51:04.625
and, uh, uh, direct student support in the classroom.

1806
01:51:05.285 --> 01:51:08.905
Um, in our contract with DTA,

1807
01:51:08.965 --> 01:51:11.985
we have specific language that's tied to class size.

1808
01:51:12.045 --> 01:51:15.105
And depending on the, the grade level, uh, that,

1809
01:51:15.175 --> 01:51:16.385
that number varies.

1810
01:51:16.385 --> 01:51:19.225
So it could be 24 to one, it could be 29 to one,

1811
01:51:19.285 --> 01:51:20.385
it could be 30 to one.

1812
01:51:21.085 --> 01:51:24.985
Um, in order to change that class size,

1813
01:51:25.295 --> 01:51:28.625
that language that would have to be negotiated, uh,

1814
01:51:28.775 --> 01:51:30.985
that would be a larger increase

1815
01:51:30.985 --> 01:51:33.705
because you actually would have less teachers if you

1816
01:51:34.025 --> 01:51:35.385
increase the contract language.

1817
01:51:36.055 --> 01:51:38.545
What we're showing here is, uh,

1818
01:51:38.545 --> 01:51:42.585
within the contract language, we are able to do overages

1819
01:51:42.605 --> 01:51:44.985
and pay teachers individually for each student

1820
01:51:44.985 --> 01:51:47.105
that is over their contract size.

1821
01:51:47.765 --> 01:51:51.185
And so this would be the savings if we actually increased,

1822
01:51:51.725 --> 01:51:54.145
uh, the overages by one or by two.

1823
01:51:54.165 --> 01:51:55.985
So if it was by one, it would be a million.

1824
01:51:56.005 --> 01:51:59.785
If it was by two, it would be 2 million falling within the

1825
01:51:59.785 --> 01:52:01.305
current contract language.

1826
01:52:01.805 --> 01:52:04.825
Uh, and you can see, uh, there would be some impact on that.

1827
01:52:04.855 --> 01:52:06.785
Obviously, uh, stu uh,

1828
01:52:07.065 --> 01:52:09.185
teachers would have more, uh, work to grade.

1829
01:52:09.405 --> 01:52:13.665
Um, not all kids may get the same attention, uh,

1830
01:52:13.935 --> 01:52:15.905
that they would if they had a teacher

1831
01:52:15.905 --> 01:52:17.625
that has smaller class size.

1832
01:52:18.325 --> 01:52:20.665
Um, it may take longer for teachers

1833
01:52:20.665 --> 01:52:22.825
to provide feedback on grading the work.

1834
01:52:23.045 --> 01:52:27.745
So it's not the ideal, um, decision, but it is a decision.

1835
01:52:28.085 --> 01:52:31.425
Um, that is a significant number in terms of savings

1836
01:52:33.855 --> 01:52:35.615
furlough days for all employees.

1837
01:52:35.915 --> 01:52:38.495
So instead of talking about a salary reduction,

1838
01:52:38.525 --> 01:52:41.975
like a straight 6% reduction, uh, of one salary,

1839
01:52:42.535 --> 01:52:46.245
a furlough day is simply you take, um, if a,

1840
01:52:46.365 --> 01:52:48.445
a employee works 185 days

1841
01:52:48.665 --> 01:52:51.645
and they take one furlough day, they get paid one less day,

1842
01:52:52.105 --> 01:52:54.805
but the salary structure is still in place so

1843
01:52:54.805 --> 01:52:56.565
that when future negotiations

1844
01:52:56.585 --> 01:52:58.485
and future salary increases happen,

1845
01:52:58.795 --> 01:53:02.725
they happen on the existing salary as opposed to a salary

1846
01:53:02.725 --> 01:53:05.645
that has been, uh, reduced by a certain percentage.

1847
01:53:06.065 --> 01:53:08.805
And so you can see that if all of our

1848
01:53:09.685 --> 01:53:12.685
certificate classified management took one furlough day,

1849
01:53:12.915 --> 01:53:14.925
that would just be under a million dollars.

1850
01:53:15.735 --> 01:53:18.405
Again, that would have to be negotiated with DTA

1851
01:53:18.405 --> 01:53:22.325
and CSEA management is not part of a union.

1852
01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:24.605
It's more of a meet and confer with them.

1853
01:53:25.105 --> 01:53:27.805
Um, but you can see what that breakdown would be

1854
01:53:27.825 --> 01:53:29.005
for each of the three units.

1855
01:53:30.705 --> 01:53:35.045
Next slide please. Assistant principal reduction

1856
01:53:35.045 --> 01:53:36.085
at the elementary level.

1857
01:53:36.545 --> 01:53:39.245
So when you look at our surrounding districts, not all

1858
01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:40.405
of our districts, uh,

1859
01:53:40.405 --> 01:53:43.005
elementary schools have assistant principals.

1860
01:53:43.465 --> 01:53:48.445
Uh, some like at San Ramon might have part-time, um, uh, aps

1861
01:53:48.545 --> 01:53:51.365
or APS based on the size of the school.

1862
01:53:51.985 --> 01:53:56.005
Uh, and so in this proposal, it would take eight of our, uh,

1863
01:53:56.005 --> 01:53:57.205
elementary aps

1864
01:53:57.205 --> 01:54:01.325
and reduce them by four, which would be a $750,000 savings.

1865
01:54:02.065 --> 01:54:04.525
Uh, what hasn't been worked out yet?

1866
01:54:04.665 --> 01:54:07.845
If, because the board hasn't given us direction, would

1867
01:54:07.845 --> 01:54:09.845
that be based on size of the school?

1868
01:54:09.975 --> 01:54:12.005
Would it be based on unique circumstances?

1869
01:54:12.405 --> 01:54:14.085
'cause maybe a school is under construction,

1870
01:54:14.085 --> 01:54:16.085
they need more supervision, uh,

1871
01:54:16.265 --> 01:54:18.565
or would we just take all APS

1872
01:54:19.025 --> 01:54:21.205
and assign them halftime at two schools?

1873
01:54:21.865 --> 01:54:25.965
So, um, in week one, they'd be at school A for three days

1874
01:54:25.965 --> 01:54:27.405
and school B for two days.

1875
01:54:27.865 --> 01:54:31.125
And, uh, week two, they'd be at school B for three days

1876
01:54:31.145 --> 01:54:32.405
and school a for two days.

1877
01:54:32.985 --> 01:54:36.525
Um, we would figure out that ratio if the board, uh,

1878
01:54:37.035 --> 01:54:40.245
gave us direction on reducing assistant principals at the

1879
01:54:40.245 --> 01:54:43.735
elementary level, eliminate

1880
01:54:43.735 --> 01:54:45.375
mid-shift custodial positions.

1881
01:54:45.595 --> 01:54:46.775
Uh, LCAP four.

1882
01:54:46.805 --> 01:54:49.615
This is about clean, maintaining our facilities.

1883
01:54:49.615 --> 01:54:51.055
We have beautiful facilities.

1884
01:54:51.395 --> 01:54:54.215
We have a deferred maintenance program that really, uh,

1885
01:54:54.375 --> 01:54:55.935
protects our facilities.

1886
01:54:56.275 --> 01:54:58.335
We have ama amazing custodians.

1887
01:54:58.355 --> 01:54:59.535
But this is another area

1888
01:54:59.605 --> 01:55:02.735
that when you look at our surrounding districts, uh,

1889
01:55:02.915 --> 01:55:06.495
at the elementary level, uh, they do not have, uh,

1890
01:55:06.495 --> 01:55:08.895
necessarily two custodians there during the day.

1891
01:55:08.895 --> 01:55:10.695
They have their head custodian there during the day,

1892
01:55:10.915 --> 01:55:12.815
and then they either have their night custodian

1893
01:55:12.815 --> 01:55:14.735
or a night crew in our case

1894
01:55:14.885 --> 01:55:16.215
that comes and cleans the schools.

1895
01:55:16.915 --> 01:55:20.295
So if we were to eliminate the 12 mid-shift custodial,

1896
01:55:20.295 --> 01:55:24.095
that would just be under, that'd be a $910,000 savings.

1897
01:55:24.915 --> 01:55:27.575
Uh, schools might have to move to a AB schedule.

1898
01:55:27.835 --> 01:55:30.695
Uh, whereas instead of every classroom, uh,

1899
01:55:30.695 --> 01:55:33.935
the tables wiped down, the floors vacuum, uh,

1900
01:55:34.035 --> 01:55:35.735
the waste paper basket's emptied.

1901
01:55:35.955 --> 01:55:37.295
You might have an a schedule

1902
01:55:37.425 --> 01:55:41.215
where every night the waste paper baskets get, um, emptied,

1903
01:55:41.395 --> 01:55:44.085
but one night the tables get cleaned the other night the

1904
01:55:44.085 --> 01:55:45.085
floors get vacuumed.

1905
01:55:45.465 --> 01:55:48.885
Um, for the most part, our our schools do a really good job

1906
01:55:48.905 --> 01:55:50.565
of keeping their classrooms clean.

1907
01:55:50.985 --> 01:55:52.565
Uh, and we do not believe

1908
01:55:52.565 --> 01:55:54.645
that this would significantly impact

1909
01:55:55.265 --> 01:55:57.525
the maintaining our quality of facilities.

1910
01:55:58.975 --> 01:56:03.565
Next slide, please. Uh, use of facilities funding

1911
01:56:03.625 --> 01:56:05.285
to make our solar loan payments.

1912
01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:07.805
Uh, Mr. Hobbs, would you like to address this one, please?

1913
01:56:07.995 --> 01:56:10.445
Yeah, the board may recall a few weeks back we talked

1914
01:56:10.445 --> 01:56:11.925
about some of the, uh, additional funds

1915
01:56:11.925 --> 01:56:14.325
that would were available on the facilities program.

1916
01:56:15.005 --> 01:56:17.605
A good chunk of that, about $6 million came from interest

1917
01:56:17.605 --> 01:56:18.725
that had been earned on money

1918
01:56:18.725 --> 01:56:20.045
that's sitting at the County Treasury.

1919
01:56:20.755 --> 01:56:22.725
What we're proposing, uh, potentially

1920
01:56:22.725 --> 01:56:26.245
with this option would be to use those facilities funds

1921
01:56:26.745 --> 01:56:28.485
to pay off a facilities project,

1922
01:56:28.585 --> 01:56:30.645
in this case our solar project.

1923
01:56:31.385 --> 01:56:35.845
So we currently have a general fund backed loan to pay off

1924
01:56:35.845 --> 01:56:37.925
that project over the next 20 or so years.

1925
01:56:38.515 --> 01:56:40.685
What we would do with this proposal be to use

1926
01:56:40.685 --> 01:56:43.165
that $6 million, use the 2.9 million

1927
01:56:43.165 --> 01:56:45.605
that the board has already set aside for repayment

1928
01:56:45.605 --> 01:56:48.365
of this loan, and for at least the next several years,

1929
01:56:48.945 --> 01:56:51.325
use those dollars to pay for, um,

1930
01:56:51.475 --> 01:56:53.125
that general fund loan payment.

1931
01:56:53.385 --> 01:56:55.525
And so that would relieve pressure on the general fund

1932
01:56:55.525 --> 01:56:58.045
to the tune of that $1.6 million each year.

1933
01:56:58.345 --> 01:56:59.845
It escalates slightly from year to year,

1934
01:56:59.845 --> 01:57:01.085
but that's the, basically the number.

1935
01:57:03.205 --> 01:57:07.145
And this, this is one, um, that staff, um,

1936
01:57:07.765 --> 01:57:09.505
is recommending and hoping

1937
01:57:09.535 --> 01:57:12.185
that potentially we can have consensus, uh,

1938
01:57:12.215 --> 01:57:14.305
tonight on including this as part

1939
01:57:14.305 --> 01:57:18.225
of the 5.5 savings if the board is ready, uh, to do that.

1940
01:57:18.605 --> 01:57:20.465
The other one, of course, was the previous one,

1941
01:57:20.485 --> 01:57:22.465
the mid shift custodian.

1942
01:57:22.805 --> 01:57:25.025
Um, and then certainly we think

1943
01:57:25.095 --> 01:57:27.545
that furlough days are appropriate thing

1944
01:57:27.565 --> 01:57:29.505
to have a discussion with our bargaining units.

1945
01:57:30.145 --> 01:57:33.945
'cause those three right there do not impact the classroom,

1946
01:57:34.085 --> 01:57:35.945
do not impact students, uh,

1947
01:57:36.285 --> 01:57:38.625
and gets us more than two thirds of the way.

1948
01:57:39.005 --> 01:57:43.435
Uh, to that 5.5, uh, million dollar goal, uh,

1949
01:57:43.755 --> 01:57:44.755
teachers on special assignment.

1950
01:57:45.175 --> 01:57:49.075
Uh, this supports three of our key, uh, goals in our lcap.

1951
01:57:49.415 --> 01:57:52.475
Our teachers are on special assignments are part of DTA.

1952
01:57:52.935 --> 01:57:55.995
Uh, we have, uh, four full-time release.

1953
01:57:56.415 --> 01:57:58.915
Uh, teachers that support curriculum instruction.

1954
01:57:59.335 --> 01:58:01.795
Uh, they're the ones that work with our lead teachers

1955
01:58:01.815 --> 01:58:02.875
and PLCs.

1956
01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:05.995
They work with teachers on developing new, uh,

1957
01:58:05.995 --> 01:58:07.195
course outlines.

1958
01:58:07.375 --> 01:58:10.595
Uh, they work with teachers on, uh, improving,

1959
01:58:11.175 --> 01:58:12.275
uh, the art of teaching.

1960
01:58:12.815 --> 01:58:16.155
Uh, they work with our teachers on incorporating our

1961
01:58:16.565 --> 01:58:17.995
board approved curriculum.

1962
01:58:18.575 --> 01:58:20.955
Um, and then we have some part-timers

1963
01:58:20.955 --> 01:58:23.715
that are released from the classroom at the school site.

1964
01:58:24.175 --> 01:58:27.955
Um, so that 8.8 is full-time equivalent.

1965
01:58:28.335 --> 01:58:30.755
Um, but it's more than eight individuals.

1966
01:58:33.655 --> 01:58:36.225
Next one, please. Elementary counselors.

1967
01:58:36.445 --> 01:58:39.585
Uh, again, in our contract with DTA,

1968
01:58:39.925 --> 01:58:41.885
we have counselor ratios, student

1969
01:58:41.905 --> 01:58:43.805
to counselor ratios for secondary.

1970
01:58:44.075 --> 01:58:46.365
There's not language in there for elementary.

1971
01:58:46.665 --> 01:58:48.445
And certainly one of the benefits

1972
01:58:48.445 --> 01:58:52.085
of having the stimulus money, uh, covid money from the state

1973
01:58:52.085 --> 01:58:53.245
and the federal government is

1974
01:58:53.245 --> 01:58:55.605
to add elementary counselors to our elementary schools.

1975
01:58:56.345 --> 01:59:00.485
Um, uh, these would be eight out of the eight counselors

1976
01:59:00.555 --> 01:59:03.085
with a 1.2, uh, million dollars savings.

1977
01:59:03.305 --> 01:59:05.645
It would impact our l LCAP goals of two

1978
01:59:05.645 --> 01:59:08.965
and three, uh, particularly supporting our students, uh,

1979
01:59:08.995 --> 01:59:13.325
with their behavior needs and also, um, mental health needs.

1980
01:59:13.745 --> 01:59:17.685
Um, and so it is, none of these choices are good choices.

1981
01:59:18.105 --> 01:59:19.725
Um, and so, uh,

1982
01:59:20.105 --> 01:59:21.445
but we have this on the list

1983
01:59:21.465 --> 01:59:23.685
as a potential, uh, proposed savings.

1984
01:59:25.305 --> 01:59:26.645
And there are mental health counselors

1985
01:59:26.665 --> 01:59:27.805
at the secondary level.

1986
01:59:28.345 --> 01:59:32.405
Um, if anything, if anything positive came out covid,

1987
01:59:32.835 --> 01:59:34.845
it's the fact that we no longer have to

1988
01:59:35.595 --> 01:59:37.485
hide issues about mental health.

1989
01:59:37.905 --> 01:59:40.405
We can bring it out into the open, into the light.

1990
01:59:40.705 --> 01:59:43.085
Uh, we don't have to have that stigma anymore.

1991
01:59:43.625 --> 01:59:47.845
Uh, this is an area that, um, across California,

1992
01:59:47.865 --> 01:59:51.845
across the nation, the number of students that are asking

1993
01:59:51.865 --> 01:59:54.725
for help and support, uh, is critical.

1994
01:59:55.265 --> 01:59:58.085
Um, this is an area that I believe, um,

1995
01:59:59.085 --> 02:00:01.085
although we have it listed, it is something

1996
02:00:01.085 --> 02:00:02.525
that I believe we should maintain.

1997
02:00:03.105 --> 02:00:06.885
Um, my previous district, when I started in 2012,

1998
02:00:06.945 --> 02:00:09.565
we only had three, uh, mental health professionals.

1999
02:00:09.985 --> 02:00:13.125
Um, by my fourth year we had 18, uh,

2000
02:00:13.125 --> 02:00:14.485
and this was even before covid.

2001
02:00:14.825 --> 02:00:17.485
And so this is an area that I think is extremely important.

2002
02:00:17.825 --> 02:00:18.885
I'm biased towards it.

2003
02:00:19.225 --> 02:00:22.165
Um, but again, we believe it was important

2004
02:00:22.165 --> 02:00:23.285
to have be on the list

2005
02:00:23.385 --> 02:00:25.005
so people understood what their role was.

2006
02:00:25.025 --> 02:00:26.645
And we can have a conversation about it.

2007
02:00:27.865 --> 02:00:32.045
Campus supervisors at the elementary school, 9.75, uh,

2008
02:00:32.075 --> 02:00:33.085
they were eliminated.

2009
02:00:33.155 --> 02:00:37.685
It'd be 640,000, uh, dollars certainly impact lcap.

2010
02:00:37.825 --> 02:00:42.805
Uh, goal three. Um, now I I I do wanna say this.

2011
02:00:43.555 --> 02:00:46.725
There's a lot of, uh, proposed ideas here

2012
02:00:46.725 --> 02:00:48.125
that would impact elementary

2013
02:00:48.505 --> 02:00:52.565
and as your superintendent, I would never, uh, recommend,

2014
02:00:52.785 --> 02:00:56.285
uh, moving forward having three or four of these being hit.

2015
02:00:56.705 --> 02:01:00.805
Uh, because the job of principalship is already hard enough.

2016
02:01:01.265 --> 02:01:04.485
Uh, the job of being a teacher is already hard enough.

2017
02:01:04.545 --> 02:01:07.925
And if you were to take away an ap, uh, a counselor,

2018
02:01:08.365 --> 02:01:11.605
a campus supervisor, at the same time, the job,

2019
02:01:12.065 --> 02:01:13.365
uh, is that much harder.

2020
02:01:13.705 --> 02:01:15.445
Uh, I understand doing one.

2021
02:01:15.865 --> 02:01:18.725
Um, uh, but I wouldn't recommend doing the three of them.

2022
02:01:18.865 --> 02:01:21.525
But again, we wanted to put 'em on the list as part of

2023
02:01:21.525 --> 02:01:23.165
that 40 million that is above

2024
02:01:23.165 --> 02:01:25.925
and beyond the base so that we could have a conversation.

2025
02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:28.325
Is this what makes Dublin Dublin?

2026
02:01:28.465 --> 02:01:32.475
And yes, we should keep them, uh,

2027
02:01:32.475 --> 02:01:36.035
health services assistance, uh, 11.3, uh,

2028
02:01:36.035 --> 02:01:37.675
745,000.

2029
02:01:37.935 --> 02:01:40.285
Um, impact, um, again,

2030
02:01:40.315 --> 02:01:42.485
this would be another impact at the elementary level,

2031
02:01:42.505 --> 02:01:45.205
but it's across the system, uh, at middle and high.

2032
02:01:45.745 --> 02:01:48.045
It would shift a lot of the work, uh, to our,

2033
02:01:48.185 --> 02:01:51.765
our office staff, uh, as well as our LVNs and our nurses.

2034
02:01:52.465 --> 02:01:56.085
Um, and, um, again,

2035
02:01:56.115 --> 02:01:59.565
that just increases the work of, uh, people

2036
02:01:59.665 --> 02:02:01.965
who are already feel like they're stretched, uh,

2037
02:02:01.965 --> 02:02:03.965
with the work that they already are assigned.

2038
02:02:05.805 --> 02:02:08.625
And then clerical positions, uh, at the site

2039
02:02:08.685 --> 02:02:11.185
and at the district office, uh, clerical,

2040
02:02:11.185 --> 02:02:12.785
we're talking more of your secretaries.

2041
02:02:13.285 --> 02:02:16.225
Uh, we have secretary four, secretary threes, uh,

2042
02:02:16.225 --> 02:02:18.105
just a couple secretary twos.

2043
02:02:18.725 --> 02:02:23.625
Um, and, um, again, there are certain, uh,

2044
02:02:23.755 --> 02:02:24.905
areas that we feel

2045
02:02:25.015 --> 02:02:28.305
that we're a little rich in, in that support.

2046
02:02:28.845 --> 02:02:32.705
Um, and so if we were to identify in a, uh, eliminate 10,

2047
02:02:33.205 --> 02:02:36.025
uh, that would be an $800,000 savings.

2048
02:02:37.085 --> 02:02:40.635
Um, so this is the same list.

2049
02:02:40.815 --> 02:02:42.595
Uh, Chris, do you wanna highlight, uh,

2050
02:02:42.695 --> 02:02:43.875
why it's slightly different

2051
02:02:43.875 --> 02:02:45.115
and what those numbers are showing?

2052
02:02:45.425 --> 02:02:47.235
Sure. So, and we'll show this in a moment,

2053
02:02:47.375 --> 02:02:49.595
but we have asked the community that's come out to, uh,

2054
02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:51.955
watch these town halls to give us feedback

2055
02:02:52.135 --> 02:02:53.355
and tell us which

2056
02:02:53.355 --> 02:02:56.035
of these 11 things would they save if they were in your

2057
02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:58.595
seat, if they had the ability to make that decision.

2058
02:02:58.765 --> 02:03:01.155
Which seven things. It was arbitrary.

2059
02:03:01.175 --> 02:03:03.435
We gave them seven votes to spend.

2060
02:03:03.435 --> 02:03:07.475
Which seven of these 11 items would they choose to, to,

2061
02:03:07.775 --> 02:03:10.995
to hold onto, um, at the expense, notably

2062
02:03:10.995 --> 02:03:12.915
of the other things potentially, right?

2063
02:03:13.495 --> 02:03:16.395
So we've had 122 participants in this survey as

2064
02:03:16.395 --> 02:03:19.195
of two 30 this afternoon when I finished this slide up.

2065
02:03:19.815 --> 02:03:24.515
And you could see how many folks of those 122 voted for

2066
02:03:25.315 --> 02:03:26.635
maintaining these items.

2067
02:03:27.055 --> 02:03:28.595
So again, the higher the number, the more

2068
02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:31.595
robust the support was for keeping

2069
02:03:31.865 --> 02:03:33.715
that particular, uh, subject.

2070
02:03:34.335 --> 02:03:36.995
And so in the case of increased class sizes, for example,

2071
02:03:37.375 --> 02:03:39.715
84 out of 122 said,

2072
02:03:40.725 --> 02:03:42.435
don't save the money that way.

2073
02:03:42.625 --> 02:03:45.795
Keep those class sizes the way they are. Don't impact that.

2074
02:03:46.815 --> 02:03:49.515
Um, you can see at the top end of that, uh,

2075
02:03:49.515 --> 02:03:53.355
elementary counselors at 92 was the, um, so far again

2076
02:03:53.355 --> 02:03:56.035
through this afternoon, the highest, uh, scoring one,

2077
02:03:56.655 --> 02:03:59.195
the facilities funding for, uh, helping

2078
02:03:59.195 --> 02:04:02.475
to pay off our solar loan has the least support for folks

2079
02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:03.555
to hold onto.

2080
02:04:04.105 --> 02:04:06.595
More people are willing to say yes, do that.

2081
02:04:07.575 --> 02:04:10.035
Um, and so it's a, it's a, you know,

2082
02:04:10.035 --> 02:04:11.555
it's not a vote, it's not an election.

2083
02:04:11.625 --> 02:04:13.675
It's not a thou shalt do this

2084
02:04:13.675 --> 02:04:15.795
because we said this was what our votes were,

2085
02:04:15.795 --> 02:04:17.515
but the intent was to bring feedback.

2086
02:04:17.895 --> 02:04:20.195
One of the questions that came up often, um,

2087
02:04:20.195 --> 02:04:23.235
during the town halls was, well, what if you did four

2088
02:04:23.235 --> 02:04:25.915
of this out of the eight or five of this and six of this?

2089
02:04:25.975 --> 02:04:27.275
And you can do the math

2090
02:04:27.275 --> 02:04:29.395
and figure out, there's a lot of permutations of this

2091
02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:30.435
that we could have created.

2092
02:04:31.335 --> 02:04:35.715
Our goal through this process was to make it fairly stark so

2093
02:04:35.715 --> 02:04:39.245
that we could get some visibility into what folks, uh,

2094
02:04:39.245 --> 02:04:40.325
felt was most important.

2095
02:04:41.065 --> 02:04:45.125
So that additional 84 out of 1 22, whatever number out

2096
02:04:45.125 --> 02:04:47.765
of 1 22, that represents the current voting.

2097
02:04:47.785 --> 02:04:49.205
And of course, we'll keep the board updated

2098
02:04:49.225 --> 02:04:51.405
as we get more data and as we move forward.

2099
02:04:52.835 --> 02:04:54.095
And then there's a slide

2100
02:04:54.095 --> 02:04:56.375
that just breaks it down by the group,

2101
02:04:57.315 --> 02:04:58.315
Right? We'll bring this back

2102
02:04:58.315 --> 02:04:58.905
up in a second.

2103
02:04:58.965 --> 02:05:01.305
But yeah, we just, um, we did add

2104
02:05:01.305 --> 02:05:03.745
after the fact, unfortunately we got a, a great suggestion

2105
02:05:03.745 --> 02:05:05.425
that we should try to disaggregate this data.

2106
02:05:05.485 --> 02:05:07.225
So we added a question to ask folks,

2107
02:05:08.445 --> 02:05:09.785
how are you related to our district?

2108
02:05:09.785 --> 02:05:10.945
Are you a parent? Are you a student?

2109
02:05:10.945 --> 02:05:12.865
Are you a classified staff member, certificate,

2110
02:05:12.865 --> 02:05:14.065
staff member, leadership staff?

2111
02:05:14.925 --> 02:05:16.665
Um, and so you can see the breakdown

2112
02:05:16.725 --> 02:05:18.105
by those different categories.

2113
02:05:18.725 --> 02:05:20.505
And again, a significant number

2114
02:05:20.505 --> 02:05:22.425
of folks either didn't answer that question

2115
02:05:22.425 --> 02:05:23.425
after we put it up

2116
02:05:23.565 --> 02:05:26.905
or, um, had answered the survey prior to us asking

2117
02:05:26.905 --> 02:05:28.825
that question, and that's in that bottom row there.

2118
02:05:28.885 --> 02:05:31.345
But that gives you a sense of how different different groups

2119
02:05:31.345 --> 02:05:36.105
of stakeholders within, um, uh, looked at those.

2120
02:05:36.645 --> 02:05:38.745
And if you do the math and add it up, it won't come out

2121
02:05:38.745 --> 02:05:40.545
to 1 22 because of course, some folks happen

2122
02:05:40.545 --> 02:05:42.625
to be both parents and staff members like me.

2123
02:05:44.625 --> 02:05:45.625
I didn't vote.

2124
02:05:47.315 --> 02:05:50.055
So now we would just like to open it up for, uh,

2125
02:05:50.115 --> 02:05:53.615
the board's initial, um, opportunity

2126
02:05:53.615 --> 02:05:56.375
because this is your first time as a group to be able

2127
02:05:56.375 --> 02:05:58.855
to see this, uh, and have a dialogue together.

2128
02:05:59.415 --> 02:06:00.975
Actually, Chris, uh, Chris, can you go

2129
02:06:00.975 --> 02:06:02.015
back to the list for me?

2130
02:06:02.115 --> 02:06:05.975
Oh, um, and then please take a seat and be more comfortable.

2131
02:06:06.515 --> 02:06:10.615
Um, we're here to, to answer questions.

2132
02:06:10.625 --> 02:06:11.775
We're here to try

2133
02:06:11.775 --> 02:06:14.495
to shine a light on unintended consequences.

2134
02:06:15.355 --> 02:06:18.375
Um, and, uh, you know, we have other members

2135
02:06:18.395 --> 02:06:19.655
of cabinet that are here.

2136
02:06:20.235 --> 02:06:22.455
Let me highlight once again that I believe

2137
02:06:22.525 --> 02:06:24.695
that the facilities funding, uh,

2138
02:06:24.765 --> 02:06:28.215
from the solar loan payments is to me a no brainer.

2139
02:06:28.875 --> 02:06:32.015
Uh, so that's base, that is something that

2140
02:06:32.525 --> 02:06:35.935
does not impact our classrooms, does not impact people.

2141
02:06:36.635 --> 02:06:40.975
Um, I do believe that the mid-shift custodial, um,

2142
02:06:41.455 --> 02:06:43.655
although would be a loss of staff members

2143
02:06:44.075 --> 02:06:46.375
who do amazing work, I think we can still

2144
02:06:47.015 --> 02:06:50.615
maintain our facilities, uh, at a, at a way that,

2145
02:06:50.755 --> 02:06:52.415
uh, everyone would be proud of.

2146
02:06:52.955 --> 02:06:56.095
And then certainly I'm gonna be open to having conversations

2147
02:06:56.095 --> 02:06:58.375
with our bargaining units around furlough days.

2148
02:06:59.035 --> 02:07:03.095
Um, and the other area that I think, uh, we could figure out

2149
02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:06.095
how to, um, divvy the work

2150
02:07:06.155 --> 02:07:07.935
or eliminate work is around

2151
02:07:07.935 --> 02:07:10.135
that clerical at the side in the do.

2152
02:07:10.835 --> 02:07:14.815
Um, that's my initial, um, uh,

2153
02:07:14.835 --> 02:07:16.815
recommendation, uh, to the board.

2154
02:07:16.995 --> 02:07:20.095
Um, and, um, not that the board is voting,

2155
02:07:20.155 --> 02:07:22.455
but if there's consensus that, hey, these are areas

2156
02:07:22.455 --> 02:07:25.335
that are important, then that helps us narrow

2157
02:07:25.525 --> 02:07:26.855
that 5.5 million.

2158
02:07:27.115 --> 02:07:29.495
But we're here to take questions, clarifications,

2159
02:07:29.965 --> 02:07:30.975
Trustee Blackman.

2160
02:07:31.315 --> 02:07:33.415
So a quick question on the chart that, um,

2161
02:07:33.415 --> 02:07:35.565
Chris Hobbs was showing us with the

2162
02:07:36.125 --> 02:07:37.525
aggregated disaggregated information.

2163
02:07:37.525 --> 02:07:39.835
What does the column N stand for?

2164
02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:41.315
Sorry, n is, uh, the number

2165
02:07:41.335 --> 02:07:42.955
of individuals in that category?

2166
02:07:43.125 --> 02:07:43.875
Thank you so much.

2167
02:07:48.005 --> 02:07:50.505
Anyone have some questions? Well start with Trustee speck.

2168
02:07:51.015 --> 02:07:52.345
Sure. I'm happy to go first.

2169
02:07:53.045 --> 02:07:55.865
Um, so it's a lot obviously take in.

2170
02:07:56.165 --> 02:07:59.945
Um, I'm glad I was able to attend at the one at Dublin High

2171
02:07:59.965 --> 02:08:02.945
to at least have a start of soaking a lot of this in.

2172
02:08:03.605 --> 02:08:05.385
Um, uh,

2173
02:08:05.675 --> 02:08:07.865
there are a few things I would want some more details on.

2174
02:08:08.125 --> 02:08:09.345
Um, the TOSA roles.

2175
02:08:09.705 --> 02:08:12.865
I know you kind of generalized curriculum adjustment course

2176
02:08:12.905 --> 02:08:16.945
outlines, but if I'm talking about eliminating positions,

2177
02:08:17.105 --> 02:08:20.185
I need to understand more specifics on, um,

2178
02:08:20.535 --> 02:08:25.185
what those actual roles are, what, um, value they bring

2179
02:08:25.185 --> 02:08:28.025
to the district and how it would be accomplished

2180
02:08:28.165 --> 02:08:29.785
or just not accomplished if

2181
02:08:29.785 --> 02:08:31.545
that person, if that role went away.

2182
02:08:31.965 --> 02:08:35.945
So would the work go away? Would it be done by someone else?

2183
02:08:36.165 --> 02:08:38.545
So just kind of, um, I would need

2184
02:08:38.545 --> 02:08:41.305
to understand a little more on that piece.

2185
02:08:41.625 --> 02:08:45.265
Absolutely. Um, the, um,

2186
02:08:46.045 --> 02:08:50.755
health service assistance, um, I also need to, would need

2187
02:08:50.755 --> 02:08:54.795
to understand, um, exactly what they're doing,

2188
02:08:54.965 --> 02:08:56.515
their tasks at the school

2189
02:08:56.735 --> 02:09:00.235
and if they went away, what, who does that,

2190
02:09:01.055 --> 02:09:02.315
um, role?

2191
02:09:03.175 --> 02:09:06.555
Um, and that one to be clear,

2192
02:09:06.555 --> 02:09:08.075
that was not an elementary only, right?

2193
02:09:08.075 --> 02:09:11.235
That was a across all that's correct. Across all schools.

2194
02:09:11.505 --> 02:09:15.515
Okay. Um, the

2195
02:09:17.985 --> 02:09:21.205
two of them, this doesn't mean I'm for or against them.

2196
02:09:21.465 --> 02:09:24.925
I'm just stating that there's two of 'em

2197
02:09:24.925 --> 02:09:27.165
where we're essentially, you'd have

2198
02:09:27.165 --> 02:09:28.165
to keep doing it every year.

2199
02:09:28.165 --> 02:09:30.005
You're sort of kicking the can down the road.

2200
02:09:30.185 --> 02:09:34.765
So if, if we furlough day employees this year, we'd have

2201
02:09:34.765 --> 02:09:36.285
to again next year, remember the five

2202
02:09:36.285 --> 02:09:38.005
and a half million was in both columns.

2203
02:09:38.505 --> 02:09:40.845
It doesn't mean I'm saying I'm against furloughing,

2204
02:09:40.945 --> 02:09:44.405
I'm just stating it only solves the problem the one year

2205
02:09:44.625 --> 02:09:46.605
and then we would have to do it again,

2206
02:09:46.605 --> 02:09:48.045
or we'd have to find another way

2207
02:09:48.505 --> 02:09:50.205
to save that amount of money.

2208
02:09:50.665 --> 02:09:53.925
Um, so it's just something I think about as I

2209
02:09:54.475 --> 02:09:57.925
make those decisions versus the others while it's, you know,

2210
02:09:58.275 --> 02:10:02.325
hard to lay off a valued employee like the,

2211
02:10:02.325 --> 02:10:04.005
that is then solved for the next year.

2212
02:10:04.105 --> 02:10:06.525
So, um, I think about that

2213
02:10:06.525 --> 02:10:07.685
as I think about the furlough days

2214
02:10:07.905 --> 02:10:09.725
and then, you know, the facility funding.

2215
02:10:10.345 --> 02:10:12.165
Um, there's only so many years

2216
02:10:12.345 --> 02:10:15.045
before we run out of those that interest money.

2217
02:10:15.105 --> 02:10:19.125
And then we either hope that the state's given us more money

2218
02:10:19.185 --> 02:10:22.445
by then or we have to lay off people.

2219
02:10:22.625 --> 02:10:26.165
So, um, they are, they're just things

2220
02:10:26.165 --> 02:10:27.565
that have to, to continue.

2221
02:10:27.665 --> 02:10:29.885
So that's something that I think about as I think of them.

2222
02:10:30.585 --> 02:10:35.165
Um, I will not, so you wanted some direction.

2223
02:10:35.165 --> 02:10:37.085
So I'll give you mine. I, I would not vote

2224
02:10:37.085 --> 02:10:39.085
for campus supervisors at the elementary school.

2225
02:10:39.545 --> 02:10:42.485
Um, they provide too valuable of a resource

2226
02:10:42.665 --> 02:10:45.385
and it's, they're inexpensive.

2227
02:10:46.005 --> 02:10:49.145
Um, and I just, yeah, I would not, um,

2228
02:10:50.595 --> 02:10:54.315
I wouldn't vote for that, um, in any situation, um,

2229
02:10:54.895 --> 02:10:59.635
on the counselors, I would not vote in total on those.

2230
02:11:00.065 --> 02:11:01.155
There's no situation

2231
02:11:01.155 --> 02:11:04.235
where I would remove all eight ELE Elementary or all five

2232
02:11:04.235 --> 02:11:05.555
and a half mental health counselors.

2233
02:11:06.395 --> 02:11:08.835
I would struggle to eliminate them at all.

2234
02:11:09.375 --> 02:11:12.755
But if there was situations where, um,

2235
02:11:13.695 --> 02:11:16.595
we felt like smaller schools, we could share some,

2236
02:11:17.055 --> 02:11:18.755
but I would not be on board

2237
02:11:18.755 --> 02:11:20.635
with totality in those two categories.

2238
02:11:21.375 --> 02:11:21.595
Um,

2239
02:11:26.315 --> 02:11:28.085
Make sure if there's, that's, um,

2240
02:11:29.875 --> 02:11:32.615
that's the direction I have at this point

2241
02:11:32.615 --> 02:11:35.895
and I welcome listening to my fellow trustees' thoughts.

2242
02:11:36.165 --> 02:11:37.215
Trustee Blackman,

2243
02:11:37.705 --> 02:11:40.135
First of all, I really appreciate the comments from

2244
02:11:40.135 --> 02:11:42.935
Trustee Speck, um, especially her insight into the furlough.

2245
02:11:42.935 --> 02:11:44.975
Thank you for providing that. That's very insightful.

2246
02:11:45.355 --> 02:11:47.295
Um, one of the things I find about this meme,

2247
02:11:47.295 --> 02:11:49.215
which is interesting, and it sort of falls in line with

2248
02:11:49.375 --> 02:11:53.335
what occurred during Last Spring's discussion about cuts, is

2249
02:11:53.335 --> 02:11:55.335
that it was more like a menu of selections.

2250
02:11:55.355 --> 02:11:58.295
And I, I always find that that's really not as effective

2251
02:11:58.295 --> 02:12:00.535
as actually providing a vision for how

2252
02:12:00.535 --> 02:12:02.015
to go about reducing budgets.

2253
02:12:02.445 --> 02:12:05.175
I've dealt with budgets that are essentially like 7, 8, 10

2254
02:12:05.175 --> 02:12:07.335
times the size of our entire district budget.

2255
02:12:07.915 --> 02:12:10.255
And when you have to cut like something that's 5%,

2256
02:12:10.395 --> 02:12:12.255
you don't look at a menu of things

2257
02:12:12.255 --> 02:12:13.615
because it has a domino effect.

2258
02:12:13.635 --> 02:12:14.855
You actually start to develop a

2259
02:12:14.855 --> 02:12:16.015
vision for how you go about cutting.

2260
02:12:16.075 --> 02:12:18.695
So the first thing I would like to ask, I need to understand

2261
02:12:18.695 --> 02:12:23.065
what is in the 39.7 all of the things that are in the 39.7.

2262
02:12:23.145 --> 02:12:26.225
I know that you found 11.5 I need to find out,

2263
02:12:26.225 --> 02:12:28.865
is the 11.5 all of those positions, are they in the,

2264
02:12:29.365 --> 02:12:30.865
are they in the 39.7?

2265
02:12:30.965 --> 02:12:34.225
In other words, can we function without all

2266
02:12:34.225 --> 02:12:35.265
of this in the district?

2267
02:12:35.385 --> 02:12:37.625
I know it wouldn't be great, but I wanna understand what's

2268
02:12:37.695 --> 02:12:39.345
what is actually in the three 9.7.

2269
02:12:40.045 --> 02:12:42.385
My next question is, is that we haven't had discussion about

2270
02:12:43.065 --> 02:12:45.025
vertical ratios and costs across each campus.

2271
02:12:45.925 --> 02:12:47.425
We should be able to understand some

2272
02:12:47.425 --> 02:12:49.105
of our overhead costs versus the

2273
02:12:49.465 --> 02:12:50.985
absolute delivery needs that we have.

2274
02:12:50.985 --> 02:12:52.185
They're on the baseline of our budget.

2275
02:12:52.805 --> 02:12:54.985
So if we're looking at the 39.7, presumably

2276
02:12:54.985 --> 02:12:57.945
that's divided across either district office locations

2277
02:12:57.965 --> 02:12:59.825
or distribute across each campus site.

2278
02:12:59.825 --> 02:13:01.625
And we would be able to determine is there a certain

2279
02:13:01.625 --> 02:13:03.225
efficiency ratio at each site

2280
02:13:03.525 --> 02:13:06.065
and then hone in on where we can make greater efficiency.

2281
02:13:06.065 --> 02:13:08.425
So that's again, a bigger global place where we could start

2282
02:13:08.425 --> 02:13:10.225
to target where the things at that site

2283
02:13:10.225 --> 02:13:11.945
that would give us efficiencies where we could save.

2284
02:13:12.725 --> 02:13:15.745
The last thing that I would also say is that I think we need

2285
02:13:15.745 --> 02:13:18.025
to go back, honestly when I look at

2286
02:13:18.375 --> 02:13:20.705
what we have done in this district is amazing,

2287
02:13:21.045 --> 02:13:23.385
but we also have a lot of benefits going through covid

2288
02:13:23.525 --> 02:13:25.305
and some of the support services that we added.

2289
02:13:25.845 --> 02:13:28.305
But we were a fully functioning school district in

2290
02:13:28.305 --> 02:13:30.105
2018 2019.

2291
02:13:30.415 --> 02:13:32.365
There's a lot of things that we have added

2292
02:13:32.715 --> 02:13:34.685
that are once not needs.

2293
02:13:35.305 --> 02:13:37.245
And I would ask that we actually look at

2294
02:13:37.275 --> 02:13:40.605
what did our district look like in 2018 2019

2295
02:13:41.185 --> 02:13:42.805
and scale it up for the number of students

2296
02:13:42.865 --> 02:13:44.325
and then look at the programs we've added

2297
02:13:44.325 --> 02:13:46.285
because that's probably where a lot of our cost is.

2298
02:13:46.285 --> 02:13:49.765
And if we could do what we were doing in 2018 2019 to be

2299
02:13:49.765 --> 02:13:53.365
as successful as we were then granted it didn't have a lot

2300
02:13:53.365 --> 02:13:55.485
of the really nice bells and whistles that we have now,

2301
02:13:56.145 --> 02:13:58.445
we would probably find an efficiency factor that'd be

2302
02:13:58.445 --> 02:13:59.525
a lot easier to live with.

2303
02:13:59.745 --> 02:14:02.525
And then add back some of the absolute extreme needs

2304
02:14:02.525 --> 02:14:03.725
that we must have in the district.

2305
02:14:03.865 --> 02:14:07.845
For example, if it's the the LVN or the the health clerks

2306
02:14:08.265 --> 02:14:09.965
or if it's the elementary counselors

2307
02:14:10.025 --> 02:14:12.445
or site supervisors, if there's some things that come

2308
02:14:12.445 --> 02:14:14.285
to the top of the list, that's what we'd add back in.

2309
02:14:14.665 --> 02:14:17.285
But I get concerned when we actually have sort of a menu

2310
02:14:17.385 --> 02:14:20.245
of things without having a deep dive understanding about the

2311
02:14:20.245 --> 02:14:21.365
impact of each one of those things.

2312
02:14:22.145 --> 02:14:24.045
So I wanna share the things that I would

2313
02:14:24.065 --> 02:14:26.605
and would not support in some detail.

2314
02:14:27.065 --> 02:14:29.725
Um, increasing class size I think is a mistake.

2315
02:14:30.515 --> 02:14:32.725
I've heard from teachers from the grading committee

2316
02:14:32.755 --> 02:14:34.885
that they're already overtaxed from the number of students

2317
02:14:34.885 --> 02:14:35.925
to the point where they can't even

2318
02:14:35.925 --> 02:14:37.485
provide feedback in the grading data.

2319
02:14:37.485 --> 02:14:39.365
Just a little sentence that says you're falling behind.

2320
02:14:39.585 --> 02:14:41.845
Get your act together if they can't handle that.

2321
02:14:41.945 --> 02:14:44.365
Now imagine trying to increase the class size.

2322
02:14:44.485 --> 02:14:46.965
I think that's asking teachers to do a lot more

2323
02:14:47.025 --> 02:14:48.565
and they're already taxed with the number

2324
02:14:48.565 --> 02:14:49.885
of students and what we ask them to do.

2325
02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:52.005
We're also gonna discuss suicide prevention.

2326
02:14:52.005 --> 02:14:54.245
We're asking teachers to start to watch every single student

2327
02:14:54.245 --> 02:14:56.845
what they're doing so that they can see like changes in

2328
02:14:57.045 --> 02:14:59.365
behavior, adding more students just makes it more difficult

2329
02:14:59.365 --> 02:15:00.325
for them to do a great job

2330
02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:01.765
and to also care for our students.

2331
02:15:01.765 --> 02:15:04.765
So I don't think this is a very, um, helpful idea.

2332
02:15:05.245 --> 02:15:07.845
I also am concerned with the impact to our parcel tax.

2333
02:15:07.905 --> 02:15:11.005
We sold it as a approach to ensuring

2334
02:15:11.005 --> 02:15:13.125
that we would maintain small class sizes.

2335
02:15:13.545 --> 02:15:16.045
So I think this goes against our parcel tax statement

2336
02:15:16.045 --> 02:15:17.125
that we sold to the community.

2337
02:15:17.825 --> 02:15:20.765
Um, with regard to Furloughing staff, I appreciate um,

2338
02:15:20.765 --> 02:15:23.005
trustee spec's comment as she mentioned

2339
02:15:23.005 --> 02:15:24.165
that it basically becomes an

2340
02:15:24.165 --> 02:15:25.365
ongoing thing we have to do every year.

2341
02:15:25.365 --> 02:15:27.365
It doesn't really solve the problem reducing

2342
02:15:27.365 --> 02:15:28.445
assistant principals.

2343
02:15:28.525 --> 02:15:29.525
I think that's challenging

2344
02:15:29.525 --> 02:15:32.685
because again, if you did a vertical analysis of each site,

2345
02:15:32.685 --> 02:15:34.525
you might be able to find where that might be possible.

2346
02:15:34.525 --> 02:15:36.845
But it does have an impact on the quality of care

2347
02:15:37.385 --> 02:15:39.805
and the ability for the administration to manage the quality

2348
02:15:39.805 --> 02:15:41.165
of our education for the students.

2349
02:15:41.225 --> 02:15:42.325
And we know how important it's,

2350
02:15:42.325 --> 02:15:43.325
especially in the younger years,

2351
02:15:44.155 --> 02:15:45.845
eliminate mid-shift custodial.

2352
02:15:46.425 --> 02:15:48.125
If you can find a way to make it work,

2353
02:15:48.515 --> 02:15:49.605
this might be a solution.

2354
02:15:49.625 --> 02:15:51.405
But one of the reasons why we did this was

2355
02:15:51.405 --> 02:15:53.445
because of the huge issues

2356
02:15:53.445 --> 02:15:55.165
that were occurring against the more crowded schools.

2357
02:15:55.625 --> 02:15:58.805
So the schools that have really extreme issues with crowding

2358
02:15:59.145 --> 02:16:02.485
and strange ways of addressing crowding during lunchtime

2359
02:16:02.505 --> 02:16:04.085
and other times I think

2360
02:16:04.085 --> 02:16:05.365
that you could probably find a solution,

2361
02:16:05.365 --> 02:16:08.525
but it might be targeted, um, use of facilities funding

2362
02:16:08.545 --> 02:16:09.925
to make solo loan payments.

2363
02:16:10.085 --> 02:16:11.725
I know when the board actually approved this,

2364
02:16:11.825 --> 02:16:12.925
we actually got a nod

2365
02:16:12.925 --> 02:16:15.125
and I believe actually the wording of the approval included

2366
02:16:15.555 --> 02:16:19.365
that we would not use bond funds to pay for the solar.

2367
02:16:20.105 --> 02:16:21.845
And this is a very specific request.

2368
02:16:22.105 --> 02:16:25.125
I'm going to lay out that we actually devised a payment

2369
02:16:25.445 --> 02:16:27.725
structure that put up a piece of property as collateral.

2370
02:16:28.305 --> 02:16:29.725
One of the reasons why we did this is

2371
02:16:29.725 --> 02:16:32.045
because we know that our solar is going to feed us power

2372
02:16:32.065 --> 02:16:33.565
and electricity to our district

2373
02:16:34.145 --> 02:16:36.285
at a more economical rate than if we started

2374
02:16:36.285 --> 02:16:38.245
to draw down from pg and e and other sources.

2375
02:16:39.025 --> 02:16:40.685
The difference is that if we didn't have solar,

2376
02:16:40.835 --> 02:16:42.485
we'd be paying for it out of the general fund.

2377
02:16:42.785 --> 02:16:45.925
So by using facilities money to pay for the solar,

2378
02:16:46.065 --> 02:16:48.965
we are essentially using facilities money for bond money

2379
02:16:49.025 --> 02:16:50.845
or facilities money to build facilities

2380
02:16:51.225 --> 02:16:53.085
to basically pay our electrical bills.

2381
02:16:53.145 --> 02:16:54.525
And that's not allowed in our bond.

2382
02:16:55.105 --> 02:16:57.845
So in order to basically reverse the decision the board made

2383
02:16:57.845 --> 02:16:59.085
to basically approve the funding

2384
02:16:59.085 --> 02:17:01.005
and the structure for the solar panels, you would need

2385
02:17:01.005 --> 02:17:03.645
to get four board members to vote to reverse their decision

2386
02:17:03.745 --> 02:17:04.925
as to how we're funding the project.

2387
02:17:05.605 --> 02:17:06.725
I don't think you're gonna get that.

2388
02:17:07.465 --> 02:17:08.885
The next thing I would like to also talk about

2389
02:17:08.885 --> 02:17:09.925
teacher on special assignment.

2390
02:17:10.225 --> 02:17:11.325
If there's special assignments

2391
02:17:11.325 --> 02:17:12.565
that you could pause right now

2392
02:17:12.665 --> 02:17:14.925
and actually defer later, I would advise doing

2393
02:17:14.925 --> 02:17:16.085
that, if that made any sense.

2394
02:17:16.735 --> 02:17:17.925
Elementary counselors,

2395
02:17:17.925 --> 02:17:19.565
we didn't have 'em before, unfortunately.

2396
02:17:19.645 --> 02:17:20.725
I know how great they are right now,

2397
02:17:21.105 --> 02:17:23.005
but if we didn't have 'em before, I know

2398
02:17:23.005 --> 02:17:24.525
that we can manage to live without them.

2399
02:17:24.525 --> 02:17:26.685
Again, unfortunately. 'cause I love our counselors,

2400
02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:29.085
mental health counselors, as many as we had

2401
02:17:29.085 --> 02:17:30.805
before in 2000, 2018

2402
02:17:30.805 --> 02:17:33.765
and 2019 if they have to jump between sites.

2403
02:17:33.765 --> 02:17:36.325
Makes sense. But again, want versus need,

2404
02:17:36.485 --> 02:17:38.165
I think we're gonna have to make some really hard decisions.

2405
02:17:38.165 --> 02:17:41.845
Campus supervisor given concerns about safety, um,

2406
02:17:42.035 --> 02:17:43.525
this is a real challenge for us.

2407
02:17:44.005 --> 02:17:45.525
I do believe we have fencing around these areas,

2408
02:17:45.625 --> 02:17:47.565
so it's possible that we could do some reductions there.

2409
02:17:47.625 --> 02:17:49.765
Health service assistants, honestly,

2410
02:17:49.845 --> 02:17:51.245
I keep asking why they're not called nurses,

2411
02:17:51.385 --> 02:17:52.685
but I guess they're not licensed.

2412
02:17:53.265 --> 02:17:54.845
I'm very concerned with loading this up.

2413
02:17:54.845 --> 02:17:55.885
When we have an emergency,

2414
02:17:55.885 --> 02:17:57.445
we don't have enough coverage at each of our sites.

2415
02:17:57.445 --> 02:17:59.445
So this would be a no for me. Clerical

2416
02:17:59.445 --> 02:18:00.525
site and district office.

2417
02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:04.885
Um, this item, I believe in the world of ai, we do more

2418
02:18:04.885 --> 02:18:05.965
and more of this on our own

2419
02:18:06.105 --> 02:18:07.925
and I do believe that we have to look at ways

2420
02:18:07.925 --> 02:18:09.405
that we can be more efficient.

2421
02:18:09.805 --> 02:18:12.325
I honestly don't know any senior administrator working

2422
02:18:12.765 --> 02:18:14.245
industry that has a clerical assistant

2423
02:18:14.245 --> 02:18:15.685
anymore in the private sector.

2424
02:18:15.995 --> 02:18:18.085
It's very rare unless you are A CEO.

2425
02:18:18.665 --> 02:18:21.045
So I understand that we have a need for it in the district,

2426
02:18:21.045 --> 02:18:23.005
but we need to look at how much of it we could actually,

2427
02:18:23.105 --> 02:18:24.605
how much we're actually really utilizing

2428
02:18:24.605 --> 02:18:26.005
and how much of it's just nice to have.

2429
02:18:26.425 --> 02:18:27.445
But those are my comments.

2430
02:18:27.745 --> 02:18:30.605
Um, I would appreciate it if some of the information

2431
02:18:30.605 --> 02:18:33.205
behind some of these, um, possible reductions

2432
02:18:33.205 --> 02:18:34.885
as they're described here, they're just one line.

2433
02:18:34.885 --> 02:18:37.125
They actually need a paragraph underneath them to explain

2434
02:18:37.145 --> 02:18:38.965
to the public exactly what they would do

2435
02:18:39.425 --> 02:18:40.925
and how they would affect each site.

2436
02:18:40.975 --> 02:18:41.445
Thank you

2437
02:18:47.405 --> 02:18:48.255
trustee quo.

2438
02:18:49.305 --> 02:18:54.175
Thank you. Um, this is

2439
02:18:54.195 --> 02:18:55.855
to, uh, assistant superintendent

2440
02:18:55.855 --> 02:18:59.695
and Chris Hobbs you said, and Chris as well.

2441
02:19:00.205 --> 02:19:02.215
This presentation was recorded

2442
02:19:02.355 --> 02:19:03.655
and it'll be made available

2443
02:19:03.715 --> 02:19:05.535
to the public for future viewing.

2444
02:19:05.675 --> 02:19:08.135
And then the survey is gonna be open

2445
02:19:08.315 --> 02:19:11.895
for quite some more time in order to get more votes.

2446
02:19:12.135 --> 02:19:15.595
'cause 122 is not representative of the entire

2447
02:19:15.655 --> 02:19:17.035
Dis Not at all. But it'll stay open. Yes.

2448
02:19:17.165 --> 02:19:18.715
Right. Um, how long do you think that,

2449
02:19:19.295 --> 02:19:20.755
do we plan to keep that open until,

2450
02:19:22.055 --> 02:19:24.355
Uh, well, I think we'll keep it open

2451
02:19:24.615 --> 02:19:28.525
or we will kind of, uh, maybe adjust it as we go,

2452
02:19:28.745 --> 02:19:31.725
but until the board, until we're confident that we're ready

2453
02:19:31.725 --> 02:19:34.205
to make a recommendation to the board that the board can,

2454
02:19:34.625 --> 02:19:38.205
uh, take action on, uh, we'll keep the survey open.

2455
02:19:38.795 --> 02:19:39.845
Okay. Thank you.

2456
02:19:40.125 --> 02:19:42.205
I just wanted to public to be aware of that fact

2457
02:19:42.205 --> 02:19:45.885
that there's no chance to put in your, um, input.

2458
02:19:46.505 --> 02:19:50.045
So, um, watch over the videos and submit the votes.

2459
02:19:50.585 --> 02:19:54.245
Um, based on our preliminary votes, it's pretty obvious what

2460
02:19:54.905 --> 02:19:57.405
the three top ones that are, um,

2461
02:19:58.375 --> 02:19:59.965
quote unquote no-brainer so to speak.

2462
02:20:00.345 --> 02:20:03.045
Um, I would like to have somewhere explanation on the

2463
02:20:04.025 --> 02:20:06.255
facilities fundings to make solar loan payments.

2464
02:20:06.255 --> 02:20:08.815
What is the consequence of taking that money out now?

2465
02:20:09.555 --> 02:20:11.855
Or, I mean, what does it do

2466
02:20:12.195 --> 02:20:14.095
for us three, four years down the line?

2467
02:20:15.315 --> 02:20:17.055
So again, the funds we're talking about using

2468
02:20:17.075 --> 02:20:19.295
for this purpose is actually not bond dollars.

2469
02:20:19.525 --> 02:20:21.695
They're, it's the interest that was generated

2470
02:20:21.795 --> 02:20:23.695
by dollars sitting in the treasury.

2471
02:20:24.355 --> 02:20:26.695
Um, the impact would be on projects

2472
02:20:26.695 --> 02:20:27.895
that have not yet been defined.

2473
02:20:28.115 --> 02:20:31.015
So right now, if you recall the, we presented

2474
02:20:31.015 --> 02:20:32.175
that those dollars existed,

2475
02:20:32.315 --> 02:20:34.695
but the board has not taken any sort of action to

2476
02:20:35.535 --> 02:20:37.175
allocate those dollars to any project.

2477
02:20:37.915 --> 02:20:40.135
So that was one of the reasons why we felt this was a

2478
02:20:40.135 --> 02:20:42.215
reasonable use of those dollars was

2479
02:20:42.215 --> 02:20:45.615
that this would allow the board to accomplish, um, the goals

2480
02:20:45.615 --> 02:20:46.695
of having a balanced budget

2481
02:20:47.235 --> 02:20:50.495
and use those dollars towards a facilities project, um,

2482
02:20:50.595 --> 02:20:52.135
in a way that that, you know,

2483
02:20:52.295 --> 02:20:54.655
I think matches the appropriate use of those funds.

2484
02:20:55.745 --> 02:21:00.485
Okay. So that sounds like to me it's interest earn on

2485
02:21:01.165 --> 02:21:03.765
a sum of money that we have in a checking account or,

2486
02:21:04.475 --> 02:21:09.305
Or sorry, sitting in the, uh, county treasurers, uh, okay.

2487
02:21:09.455 --> 02:21:12.225
Bank and save the budgetary scenario changes

2488
02:21:12.365 --> 02:21:13.385
in two, three years times.

2489
02:21:13.535 --> 02:21:17.265
That could be just, it would just replenish it based on the

2490
02:21:17.745 --> 02:21:19.735
interest being paid, right?

2491
02:21:20.055 --> 02:21:21.095
I mean, going, going forward.

2492
02:21:22.305 --> 02:21:24.545
I guess what I'm trying to say is to, uh,

2493
02:21:24.895 --> 02:21:28.205
trustee spec's point, if we did this,

2494
02:21:28.235 --> 02:21:30.525
this would be a temporary measure to get us

2495
02:21:30.525 --> 02:21:31.725
through a couple years, maybe

2496
02:21:31.755 --> 02:21:33.125
Approximately five. Yes.

2497
02:21:33.405 --> 02:21:34.935
Approximately five years. Five

2498
02:21:34.935 --> 02:21:35.935
To six years, yes. That's

2499
02:21:35.935 --> 02:21:36.575
how much it would, that's

2500
02:21:36.575 --> 02:21:37.775
how long it would last, correct.

2501
02:21:38.075 --> 02:21:40.415
If we had to keep doing this, right?

2502
02:21:40.915 --> 02:21:43.695
If, if say the budget scenario changes in two,

2503
02:21:43.695 --> 02:21:46.895
three years time, the state has more funds, this type

2504
02:21:46.895 --> 02:21:48.615
of process could be, um,

2505
02:21:48.705 --> 02:21:49.855
Could be curtailed at any time.

2506
02:21:49.855 --> 02:21:50.935
Curtail, yes. Okay.

2507
02:21:51.265 --> 02:21:54.785
Thank you. Um, yeah,

2508
02:21:54.845 --> 02:21:58.425
and just look, looking at a survey makes it kind of easy

2509
02:21:58.685 --> 02:22:02.705
for me to just go with the most bottom three least favorable

2510
02:22:03.085 --> 02:22:05.745
as voted of course, to make up for the rest of it.

2511
02:22:05.785 --> 02:22:07.785
I imagine we can take a little bit of here and there

2512
02:22:07.845 --> 02:22:10.265
and come to, uh, 5.5 million,

2513
02:22:10.605 --> 02:22:14.475
but the bottom three would be furlough, uh,

2514
02:22:14.525 --> 02:22:15.835
solar loan payments

2515
02:22:15.895 --> 02:22:18.275
and teach on, teach on special assignments.

2516
02:22:19.135 --> 02:22:20.755
So I appreciate that feedback.

2517
02:22:20.935 --> 02:22:24.395
Um, and if you just did the approach of the BOB three,

2518
02:22:24.655 --> 02:22:26.165
that's one way of looking at it.

2519
02:22:26.685 --> 02:22:30.405
I think, uh, the majority of individuals,

2520
02:22:31.395 --> 02:22:35.415
even teachers, but certainly classified employees

2521
02:22:35.595 --> 02:22:37.335
and definitely um,

2522
02:22:37.645 --> 02:22:40.895
parents in the community have no idea what Atsa does.

2523
02:22:41.395 --> 02:22:42.935
And so that's why it is important

2524
02:22:42.935 --> 02:22:45.335
to talk about the role of PTs.

2525
02:22:45.755 --> 02:22:49.015
Um, and so, um, I think

2526
02:22:49.015 --> 02:22:51.015
that's why they receive the least amount votes

2527
02:22:51.015 --> 02:22:54.255
because people don't, uh, under understand, uh, their role.

2528
02:22:54.915 --> 02:22:57.815
Um, and so that is something that we will have to make sure,

2529
02:22:58.435 --> 02:23:03.135
um, that we express exactly what that impact would be.

2530
02:23:03.635 --> 02:23:05.815
Um, as I, I thought I mentioned it,

2531
02:23:05.815 --> 02:23:07.375
but I'll just reinforce it.

2532
02:23:07.755 --> 02:23:09.855
Um, I believe this is one of those areas

2533
02:23:10.365 --> 02:23:12.215
that we can do a reduction,

2534
02:23:12.515 --> 02:23:16.215
but I'm not supportive of reducing all eight of, um,

2535
02:23:16.595 --> 02:23:17.735
the, the positions.

2536
02:23:17.955 --> 02:23:20.815
And so, um, we'll have to do a, a good job of

2537
02:23:21.335 --> 02:23:23.055
identifying those that would

2538
02:23:23.115 --> 02:23:25.015
and what would be the impact, uh,

2539
02:23:25.035 --> 02:23:28.295
and if the board shows all what the real impact would be.

2540
02:23:33.035 --> 02:23:34.855
All right. All right. I have a few questions too.

2541
02:23:35.355 --> 02:23:37.095
Um, question on the furlough days.

2542
02:23:37.155 --> 02:23:38.095
You said it, you would need to be

2543
02:23:38.095 --> 02:23:39.295
negotiated, which I understand.

2544
02:23:39.595 --> 02:23:42.775
And um, at this point, I know in like oh 8, 0 9,

2545
02:23:43.395 --> 02:23:46.015
the state allowed for shorter year, this would have to be

2546
02:23:46.725 --> 02:23:48.135
non-student days, correct?

2547
02:23:48.925 --> 02:23:51.255
That is correct. Is there a

2548
02:23:51.975 --> 02:23:54.455
deadline in the year when we would need to do this so

2549
02:23:54.455 --> 02:23:57.255
that we had days to use?

2550
02:23:59.035 --> 02:24:01.725
Like what, when is the last day that teachers work

2551
02:24:01.725 --> 02:24:05.005
that kids aren't there, that we might need to do this by?

2552
02:24:06.885 --> 02:24:08.015
Well, this would be for the

2553
02:24:08.015 --> 02:24:09.175
next year. Not this year. This would be for year,

2554
02:24:09.175 --> 02:24:09.855
Year. Year. Okay. Right.

2555
02:24:09.855 --> 02:24:12.215
So we, so it would be any of the staff development days

2556
02:24:12.215 --> 02:24:14.055
that we have, staff development the two days prior

2557
02:24:14.055 --> 02:24:16.535
to the start of the school year, the staff development days

2558
02:24:16.535 --> 02:24:17.775
that we have throughout the year,

2559
02:24:18.155 --> 02:24:21.575
and the one at the end of the year, um, for the secondary.

2560
02:24:21.715 --> 02:24:26.495
So it's a matter of if it's, since we have to negotiate it,

2561
02:24:26.555 --> 02:24:27.655
we would do an MOU

2562
02:24:27.955 --> 02:24:29.455
and then that would adjust the,

2563
02:24:30.035 --> 02:24:31.855
the calendar without impacting the

2564
02:24:31.855 --> 02:24:33.215
instructional calendar for students.

2565
02:24:33.285 --> 02:24:36.375
Correct. We wouldn't be changing the 180

2566
02:24:36.845 --> 02:24:38.015
instructional days.

2567
02:24:38.245 --> 02:24:42.605
Correct. Um, and this might be more in the weeds,

2568
02:24:42.605 --> 02:24:45.245
but does this impact, so if the teachers worked

2569
02:24:45.835 --> 02:24:49.045
that calendar, would that be considered a full year

2570
02:24:49.625 --> 02:24:53.685
of service for them or any employee?

2571
02:24:54.345 --> 02:24:57.765
Uh, it would be a negotiated work year, so yes, uh,

2572
02:24:57.905 --> 02:25:00.165
it would be a, a considered a full year,

2573
02:25:00.165 --> 02:25:02.125
but we will con confirm that with stirs.

2574
02:25:02.395 --> 02:25:03.565
Yeah, I would just wanna make sure

2575
02:25:03.565 --> 02:25:06.215
that we're not messing people's stirs

2576
02:25:06.215 --> 02:25:08.535
and pers up, um, at the end.

2577
02:25:08.755 --> 02:25:11.775
So, um, that to me, there's some, some questions with that.

2578
02:25:11.935 --> 02:25:15.505
I see, you know, options there.

2579
02:25:16.285 --> 02:25:21.185
Um, I definitely, yeah, saw that a lot of elementary, um,

2580
02:25:21.765 --> 02:25:23.845
and there's not a lot of admin and,

2581
02:25:24.065 --> 02:25:27.005
and high a lot of adults, you know,

2582
02:25:27.005 --> 02:25:28.405
extra adults at the elementary level.

2583
02:25:28.505 --> 02:25:32.685
So, um, those definitely are ones I would not,

2584
02:25:32.695 --> 02:25:33.765
would not be supporting.

2585
02:25:33.815 --> 02:25:35.885
Again, I won't be here, but, um,

2586
02:25:36.465 --> 02:25:40.725
and I know we had counselors at the elementary level prior

2587
02:25:40.825 --> 02:25:44.605
to CI mean, I know my, when my kids were in elementary,

2588
02:25:45.015 --> 02:25:48.375
there were counselors and that was many years ago now.

2589
02:25:48.875 --> 02:25:51.335
Um, so I don't believe they have all come since then.

2590
02:25:51.495 --> 02:25:52.575
I don't know specifically.

2591
02:25:52.795 --> 02:25:57.335
Um, personally I think given what we know in our students

2592
02:25:57.635 --> 02:26:01.895
and that we have ongoing effects of covid, of everything

2593
02:26:02.045 --> 02:26:04.455
that, um, I think there is a lot of mental health, um,

2594
02:26:05.235 --> 02:26:06.375
at both the elementary

2595
02:26:06.375 --> 02:26:08.735
and the secondary level that those counselors can support

2596
02:26:09.195 --> 02:26:10.255
on an ongoing basis.

2597
02:26:10.595 --> 02:26:14.055
So for me, those are, those, um, are, are concerning.

2598
02:26:14.675 --> 02:26:18.515
Um, I think if the facilities funding works within there,

2599
02:26:18.595 --> 02:26:20.915
I think that to me, yeah, is a no brainer.

2600
02:26:21.735 --> 02:26:24.755
Um, and to me,

2601
02:26:25.335 --> 02:26:27.715
if you're looking at like the health service assistance

2602
02:26:27.715 --> 02:26:31.435
versus the clerical, I feel like the health is more

2603
02:26:31.435 --> 02:26:34.395
specialized and kind of focusing on, on kind

2604
02:26:34.395 --> 02:26:35.555
of day-to-Day student things.

2605
02:26:36.055 --> 02:26:38.915
Um, hopefully we could find some other things

2606
02:26:38.915 --> 02:26:40.235
that could kind of back rub stuff.

2607
02:26:40.275 --> 02:26:41.835
I know that's all important and we all have

2608
02:26:41.915 --> 02:26:43.075
a ton of paperwork to get done.

2609
02:26:43.655 --> 02:26:45.195
The state always likes to add more

2610
02:26:45.195 --> 02:26:46.395
and more paperwork on things.

2611
02:26:46.695 --> 02:26:48.155
Um, but I think we're,

2612
02:26:48.155 --> 02:26:49.555
we're trying to address that at some point.

2613
02:26:49.555 --> 02:26:52.795
Hopefully they'll listen. Um, so that would be

2614
02:26:52.795 --> 02:26:54.355
where I would lo lean.

2615
02:26:54.535 --> 02:26:56.115
Um, and definitely one

2616
02:26:56.115 --> 02:26:57.555
of the things I did write down too was

2617
02:26:57.825 --> 02:27:00.275
what specifically are the teachers on special assignment?

2618
02:27:00.935 --> 02:27:02.595
Um, a little more information

2619
02:27:02.595 --> 02:27:03.675
on that I think would be helpful.

2620
02:27:05.055 --> 02:27:07.395
Um, and I think the custodial,

2621
02:27:07.595 --> 02:27:10.715
I think we could manage on that.

2622
02:27:10.915 --> 02:27:12.595
I, I do definitely think I

2623
02:27:15.105 --> 02:27:16.335
would, would be manageable.

2624
02:27:16.495 --> 02:27:17.615
I think we'd need to look at it.

2625
02:27:18.275 --> 02:27:20.335
Um, and I think, I think it's too,

2626
02:27:20.455 --> 02:27:23.175
I think it's really challenging to look at

2627
02:27:23.265 --> 02:27:25.455
where we were in 20 18, 20 19.

2628
02:27:25.505 --> 02:27:29.205
We've opened a high school, which comes with it, you know,

2629
02:27:29.205 --> 02:27:30.285
additional things.

2630
02:27:30.365 --> 02:27:32.245
I, I think there's just so many things has changed.

2631
02:27:32.245 --> 02:27:36.865
Like nothing. We're, we're, we're not,

2632
02:27:36.925 --> 02:27:38.745
we can't go back to where we were there.

2633
02:27:39.025 --> 02:27:41.025
'cause everything has changed in terms

2634
02:27:41.045 --> 02:27:43.015
of so many different things.

2635
02:27:43.115 --> 02:27:46.775
So, um, I have a hard time with kind of going back

2636
02:27:46.775 --> 02:27:47.775
and just rolling things back.

2637
02:27:47.795 --> 02:27:50.825
But I do know, I mean, I don't know Dr. Campbell,

2638
02:27:50.845 --> 02:27:52.345
do you know what we had counselor wise?

2639
02:27:52.345 --> 02:27:53.945
Anyone know we had counselor wise prior,

2640
02:27:54.005 --> 02:27:58.045
but I, I know we had them and my kids are high school

2641
02:27:58.065 --> 02:28:00.925
and beyond, and so they were in elementary a while ago.

2642
02:28:02.235 --> 02:28:04.325
Yeah. Uh, Mr. Hobbs just leaned over

2643
02:28:04.345 --> 02:28:06.645
and asked when we got the elementary counselors and I,

2644
02:28:06.645 --> 02:28:08.925
and I don't really remember the year,

2645
02:28:08.985 --> 02:28:11.925
but I remember Megan Rouse when she was up on the board,

2646
02:28:12.065 --> 02:28:13.205
she really pushed for it.

2647
02:28:13.265 --> 02:28:15.045
It, it was prior to Covid.

2648
02:28:15.205 --> 02:28:17.405
I, I just, I can't remember what year we got them.

2649
02:28:18.025 --> 02:28:19.675
Well, we had 'em part-time, So

2650
02:28:19.915 --> 02:28:21.525
A site would have Like two

2651
02:28:21.745 --> 02:28:24.245
and then it was maybe 20 18, 20 19

2652
02:28:24.245 --> 02:28:26.365
where it became a full counselor at every site.

2653
02:28:26.385 --> 02:28:29.325
But you had 'em, you just shared it with a another site.

2654
02:28:30.655 --> 02:28:32.545
Yeah. So we had some, um,

2655
02:28:33.125 --> 02:28:36.105
and yeah, I think some of these might be, can we,

2656
02:28:36.845 --> 02:28:38.785
can you potentially shave a little bit off of versus

2657
02:28:39.495 --> 02:28:40.825
cutting entirely?

2658
02:28:41.685 --> 02:28:45.265
Um, I'm just gonna, I just feel like any

2659
02:28:45.265 --> 02:28:47.185
of the counseling is going to impact

2660
02:28:47.695 --> 02:28:48.945
your special education numbers.

2661
02:28:48.945 --> 02:28:50.545
You're gonna impact everything.

2662
02:28:50.805 --> 02:28:54.465
So to me that just kind of kicks problems down the road

2663
02:28:54.965 --> 02:28:57.985
and causes more costs that, um, so

2664
02:28:58.455 --> 02:29:00.505
that would be my, my 2 cents.

2665
02:29:00.685 --> 02:29:02.825
Um, I just kind of confirm, I checked earlier,

2666
02:29:02.845 --> 02:29:04.785
we don't have any public comment at this point in time.

2667
02:29:05.285 --> 02:29:08.865
Um, I do as trustee quo said, encourage people to, to look,

2668
02:29:09.085 --> 02:29:10.225
um, and Trustee Spec

2669
02:29:10.225 --> 02:29:12.225
and Trustee Blackman, do you both have your hand up?

2670
02:29:12.885 --> 02:29:14.055
Yeah, I had one more.

2671
02:29:14.235 --> 02:29:15.775
Um, you mentioned, um,

2672
02:29:16.575 --> 02:29:19.655
neighboring districts are potentially in a different place

2673
02:29:19.655 --> 02:29:21.335
with us as far as mid-shift custodians

2674
02:29:21.395 --> 02:29:23.215
and assistant principals at the elementary.

2675
02:29:23.635 --> 02:29:26.095
So I would like data on that if we can get it.

2676
02:29:26.095 --> 02:29:27.495
Just to understand, um,

2677
02:29:27.835 --> 02:29:30.335
do any neighboring districts have mid-shift custodial?

2678
02:29:30.535 --> 02:29:32.695
'cause I think if they don't, then that

2679
02:29:33.245 --> 02:29:36.695
does definitely lead me to, you know, a place

2680
02:29:36.695 --> 02:29:37.895
where we're higher than

2681
02:29:37.895 --> 02:29:39.255
other districts that we don't need to be.

2682
02:29:39.755 --> 02:29:42.375
Um, and then, uh, I would love

2683
02:29:42.375 --> 02:29:44.295
to understand assistant principals at the

2684
02:29:44.295 --> 02:29:45.455
elementary as well.

2685
02:29:45.955 --> 02:29:49.095
Um, I do know that, uh,

2686
02:29:49.095 --> 02:29:51.375
our elementary schools might be fuller,

2687
02:29:51.375 --> 02:29:55.695
but they're certainly not full like they were 20 18, 20 19.

2688
02:29:56.195 --> 02:30:00.575
Um, we, all of them are are moving down into, um,

2689
02:30:00.765 --> 02:30:02.135
just much more manageable numbers.

2690
02:30:02.635 --> 02:30:04.975
Um, I think the other thing I'm, I'm very aware

2691
02:30:04.975 --> 02:30:08.215
of is we're talking, these is in a year

2692
02:30:08.215 --> 02:30:09.415
and a half, we're opening another school.

2693
02:30:10.075 --> 02:30:12.455
So we're have another elementary counselor

2694
02:30:12.675 --> 02:30:14.855
and another elementary assistant principal.

2695
02:30:14.955 --> 02:30:18.135
And so I'm just trying to think ahead to those as well.

2696
02:30:18.555 --> 02:30:20.855
Um, especially as I think about Sher Mark Hill's opening

2697
02:30:21.075 --> 02:30:23.015
and how much smaller like Doherty

2698
02:30:23.015 --> 02:30:26.095
and Murray both get with that, the impact of that.

2699
02:30:26.195 --> 02:30:30.135
So, um, You know, we're talking about cuts,

2700
02:30:30.135 --> 02:30:31.615
but then we're talking about opening a school which

2701
02:30:31.685 --> 02:30:32.895
adds, adds in more.

2702
02:30:33.035 --> 02:30:35.455
So I, I just feel like there's gonna be even more

2703
02:30:36.085 --> 02:30:37.615
that we have to kind of dial in

2704
02:30:37.615 --> 02:30:38.975
thinking with that school opening,

2705
02:30:45.345 --> 02:30:46.345
Uh, trustee Blackman. And

2706
02:30:46.345 --> 02:30:47.285
then I'll take the one public comment.

2707
02:30:47.285 --> 02:30:48.845
If there's any other public comment, um,

2708
02:30:48.845 --> 02:30:51.205
please get in in the next, it's like 8 0 1.

2709
02:30:51.205 --> 02:30:52.325
So in the next like two minutes

2710
02:30:52.505 --> 02:30:53.765
and then I'll close public comment.

2711
02:30:54.425 --> 02:30:56.445
So I appreciate the question that had been asked

2712
02:30:56.445 --> 02:30:58.885
by trustee quo and the clarification by our staff.

2713
02:30:59.445 --> 02:31:01.565
I would make, uh, with regard to the facilities funding,

2714
02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:03.325
I would make a request because I actually think

2715
02:31:03.325 --> 02:31:04.765
that the way it's written is a misnomer.

2716
02:31:04.935 --> 02:31:06.845
We're not talking about actual facilities funding

2717
02:31:06.845 --> 02:31:08.565
that actually has been set aside for facilities.

2718
02:31:08.565 --> 02:31:11.365
We're talking about interest held in, um, securities

2719
02:31:11.465 --> 02:31:14.885
or, um, some type of like, account

2720
02:31:16.155 --> 02:31:17.535
for our facilities funds.

2721
02:31:18.075 --> 02:31:19.615
So could we clarify in the statement,

2722
02:31:19.615 --> 02:31:21.815
we're actually not talking about facilities funding itself.

2723
02:31:21.825 --> 02:31:25.135
We're talking about interest on health facilities funds.

2724
02:31:25.775 --> 02:31:27.615
I think that would help clarify for the public

2725
02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:30.495
that we're not actually cutting into existing facility funds

2726
02:31:30.495 --> 02:31:32.855
that we have reserved for dealing with those issues.

2727
02:31:32.855 --> 02:31:33.735
But we're talking about what

2728
02:31:33.735 --> 02:31:34.935
we're making in terms of interest.

2729
02:31:36.185 --> 02:31:38.035
Yeah, we've certainly kind of made that point

2730
02:31:38.095 --> 02:31:40.275
as we've had those conversations during the meetings

2731
02:31:40.275 --> 02:31:42.995
that this was, um, interest that was earned

2732
02:31:43.015 --> 02:31:45.395
and was not currently, um, dedicated

2733
02:31:45.395 --> 02:31:46.395
to any particular project.

2734
02:31:47.055 --> 02:31:48.075
So it would not impact

2735
02:31:48.075 --> 02:31:49.235
any of the projects that are currently

2736
02:31:49.435 --> 02:31:50.435
Underway. But I understand, but for

2737
02:31:50.435 --> 02:31:51.115
anybody who's not hearing

2738
02:31:51.115 --> 02:31:52.275
that and just reading it, Mm-Hmm.

2739
02:31:52.355 --> 02:31:53.475
Like I know I attended the

2740
02:31:53.475 --> 02:31:54.795
presentation, but I didn't hear that.

2741
02:31:54.895 --> 02:31:57.195
So, okay. Um, I'm reading what was

2742
02:31:57.355 --> 02:31:58.355
provided in the presentation,

2743
02:31:58.355 --> 02:32:00.035
but thank you very much for clarifying it. Great.

2744
02:32:00.505 --> 02:32:03.715
Well, and I think further clarification, when we brought,

2745
02:32:03.855 --> 02:32:05.515
uh, the concept to the board of

2746
02:32:05.535 --> 02:32:09.755
how much funding was left in facilities, if you recall,

2747
02:32:09.755 --> 02:32:12.595
it was just under $10 million of that 10 million,

2748
02:32:13.055 --> 02:32:14.675
6 million is interest.

2749
02:32:15.375 --> 02:32:18.995
So it is tied to facilities and future projects,

2750
02:32:19.455 --> 02:32:23.395
but it's not, uh, public approved bonds money.

2751
02:32:23.805 --> 02:32:26.075
Right. But it is for future projects.

2752
02:32:27.445 --> 02:32:29.185
It it's still for facilities. Projects,

2753
02:32:29.185 --> 02:32:30.185
Yes. Yes.

2754
02:32:30.185 --> 02:32:34.255
But it's the

2755
02:32:34.695 --> 02:32:35.975
interest that was generated

2756
02:32:35.995 --> 02:32:38.255
and the interest is what's allowable for us

2757
02:32:38.275 --> 02:32:39.655
to use in the general fund.

2758
02:32:44.245 --> 02:32:47.495
Alright. Public comment? Yes.

2759
02:32:47.635 --> 02:32:50.495
Um, we have one parent anonymous who'd like

2760
02:32:50.495 --> 02:32:51.935
to make a public comment via Zoom.

2761
02:32:52.155 --> 02:32:53.155
Go ahead please.

2762
02:32:58.555 --> 02:33:00.345
Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

2763
02:33:00.525 --> 02:33:01.785
And thank you Mr. Hobbs

2764
02:33:01.785 --> 02:33:04.385
and Superintendent Fung for the great presentation.

2765
02:33:05.045 --> 02:33:07.425
Um, and as a parent, I really appreciate

2766
02:33:07.425 --> 02:33:09.785
that you have been involving the community,

2767
02:33:09.975 --> 02:33:11.385
notifying them in advance

2768
02:33:11.385 --> 02:33:13.985
regarding the town hall meetings that you've been having.

2769
02:33:14.085 --> 02:33:15.705
So I really appreciate all of that.

2770
02:33:16.205 --> 02:33:18.545
Uh, but I do have a question regarding the survey.

2771
02:33:19.205 --> 02:33:22.465
Um, in yesterday's email that we received

2772
02:33:22.465 --> 02:33:25.265
for the virtual town hall, it said in the end

2773
02:33:25.265 --> 02:33:27.505
that we will be given access to a survey

2774
02:33:27.555 --> 02:33:29.185
where we can choose the options,

2775
02:33:29.725 --> 02:33:32.945
but I do not see any emails separately with the survey.

2776
02:33:33.125 --> 02:33:35.625
So could I please request the district leadership

2777
02:33:35.625 --> 02:33:40.105
to send out that survey, um, and then notify parents again,

2778
02:33:40.265 --> 02:33:43.425
because most people don't have access to the survey.

2779
02:33:43.725 --> 02:33:48.585
And, um, this is possibly the, a few times that parents,

2780
02:33:48.845 --> 02:33:50.385
uh, must have heard about it.

2781
02:33:51.005 --> 02:33:54.025
And other than that, I think since I am, um,

2782
02:33:54.345 --> 02:33:57.025
speaking right now, I can possibly give you some insight on

2783
02:33:57.025 --> 02:33:59.345
what parents, uh, would appreciate

2784
02:33:59.365 --> 02:34:01.745
and which also is reflective, uh,

2785
02:34:01.745 --> 02:34:04.945
reflected on the survey based on the 1 22 participants

2786
02:34:04.975 --> 02:34:08.265
that have, um, taken it already as a parent,

2787
02:34:08.545 --> 02:34:10.385
I think no parent would want, um,

2788
02:34:10.485 --> 02:34:11.905
the class size to increase.

2789
02:34:12.105 --> 02:34:14.985
I, I know teachers are doing an amazing job, uh,

2790
02:34:14.985 --> 02:34:17.105
but they have so much on their plate too.

2791
02:34:17.705 --> 02:34:20.645
And I think no matter whether it's elementary, middle,

2792
02:34:20.705 --> 02:34:23.725
or high, if we can maintain the teacher to, um,

2793
02:34:24.125 --> 02:34:27.005
students ratio, uh, I think both from academic

2794
02:34:27.265 --> 02:34:29.245
and uh, learning point of view,

2795
02:34:29.445 --> 02:34:31.085
I think it would be great if we can do that.

2796
02:34:31.285 --> 02:34:35.925
I think from a parent's perspective, um, having like, uh,

2797
02:34:36.015 --> 02:34:39.285
elementary school campus supervisors is so essential.

2798
02:34:39.445 --> 02:34:41.285
I have friends who are known supervisors

2799
02:34:41.285 --> 02:34:45.125
and I hear stories of how much, um, it's required.

2800
02:34:45.845 --> 02:34:48.205
Although I do not have children in elementary,

2801
02:34:48.405 --> 02:34:50.845
I think I would really support, um, trustees

2802
02:34:50.865 --> 02:34:53.925
who have brought up the fact that having proper

2803
02:34:54.445 --> 02:34:56.245
supervision in elementary schools, it's,

2804
02:34:56.505 --> 02:34:57.605
is really essential.

2805
02:34:58.305 --> 02:34:59.765
And then other than that,

2806
02:34:59.765 --> 02:35:02.045
like if we just look from a bird's eye view,

2807
02:35:02.165 --> 02:35:04.445
I think the clerical site positions,

2808
02:35:04.465 --> 02:35:07.085
if those can be reduced, um, I think

2809
02:35:07.085 --> 02:35:08.605
that will not impact the students

2810
02:35:08.705 --> 02:35:10.525
and the teachers, um, directly.

2811
02:35:10.745 --> 02:35:13.885
So I'm sure you all will do a great job discussing

2812
02:35:13.985 --> 02:35:15.485
and making final decisions,

2813
02:35:15.505 --> 02:35:18.325
but as a parent, if I could just request for the survey

2814
02:35:18.425 --> 02:35:21.965
to be sent out again, if it's already been sent, um,

2815
02:35:22.035 --> 02:35:23.445
that would be really appreciated.

2816
02:35:23.775 --> 02:35:24.775
Thank you.

2817
02:35:27.035 --> 02:35:28.255
So I appreciate those comments.

2818
02:35:28.555 --> 02:35:32.815
Uh, the survey was tied to the QR code that was, uh,

2819
02:35:32.915 --> 02:35:36.015
at the end of the presentation, uh, last night as well.

2820
02:35:36.245 --> 02:35:41.095
That was, uh, in the, uh, comments, um, the

2821
02:35:41.885 --> 02:35:43.095
recording last night

2822
02:35:43.235 --> 02:35:45.495
or the presentation last night was recorded.

2823
02:35:46.035 --> 02:35:49.095
Uh, and so that will be placed not only on our website,

2824
02:35:49.115 --> 02:35:51.775
but we will send out the link to the recording.

2825
02:35:52.155 --> 02:35:54.335
Uh, that again will then allow, uh,

2826
02:35:54.335 --> 02:35:55.775
individuals to take the survey.

2827
02:35:56.195 --> 02:35:59.495
Uh, we just have to edit the, um, recording

2828
02:35:59.495 --> 02:36:01.695
because it was running for a good 15 minutes

2829
02:36:01.695 --> 02:36:03.535
before we actually started the presentation.

2830
02:36:03.555 --> 02:36:05.615
So we wanna make the recording as tight as possible.

2831
02:36:06.355 --> 02:36:08.135
Uh, and then just one clarification.

2832
02:36:08.755 --> 02:36:11.255
Um, when we're talking about campus supervisors,

2833
02:36:11.345 --> 02:36:13.975
those are the employees that are there all day.

2834
02:36:14.435 --> 02:36:17.375
The noon supervisors is a different funding

2835
02:36:17.555 --> 02:36:21.175
and we are not recommending reducing the noon supervisors.

2836
02:36:21.475 --> 02:36:25.055
So the noon supervisors at lunchtime would continue, uh,

2837
02:36:25.425 --> 02:36:28.535
under this scenario if campus supervisors were

2838
02:36:28.535 --> 02:36:29.975
reduced or eliminated.

2839
02:36:31.875 --> 02:36:33.935
Can I ask one other question to Mr. Hobbs?

2840
02:36:34.035 --> 02:36:37.175
Um, when, when is the next piece of next pie

2841
02:36:37.175 --> 02:36:38.695
of the wheel on the budget?

2842
02:36:39.435 --> 02:36:41.855
Uh, that, that next trivial pursuit piece will be the, uh,

2843
02:36:41.855 --> 02:36:43.535
first interim presentation in December.

2844
02:36:44.135 --> 02:36:45.615
December. So at that point, that'll be

2845
02:36:45.615 --> 02:36:47.575
Through actuals through October 31.

2846
02:36:47.995 --> 02:36:50.935
So we'll have some update on the budget as to

2847
02:36:50.935 --> 02:36:53.015
what we've spent so far this year compared to

2848
02:36:53.015 --> 02:36:55.175
what we thought we were spending, what we actually got from

2849
02:36:55.175 --> 02:36:57.615
the state, though that didn't seem to change too much,

2850
02:36:57.755 --> 02:37:00.175
but we should have a little bit more information

2851
02:37:00.275 --> 02:37:01.735
in December and we'll

2852
02:37:01.735 --> 02:37:03.175
Have our updated enrollment counts

2853
02:37:03.175 --> 02:37:05.935
and all of those projections based on just having

2854
02:37:05.935 --> 02:37:07.135
more data available to us.

2855
02:37:07.405 --> 02:37:10.015
Okay. So that might adjust up

2856
02:37:10.015 --> 02:37:12.965
or down that 5.5 slightly.

2857
02:37:13.285 --> 02:37:14.325
I know which way I hope it will.

2858
02:37:14.465 --> 02:37:17.005
Yes. I think we're all hoping that,

2859
02:37:17.025 --> 02:37:19.405
but I just, well, I just kind of couldn't remember

2860
02:37:19.405 --> 02:37:21.285
where in the timeline we were on, on budget.

2861
02:37:21.305 --> 02:37:23.925
So we'll have one more kind of look at that and then

2862
02:37:24.385 --> 02:37:27.445
before the budget for next year is

2863
02:37:28.815 --> 02:37:30.905
discussed and set and where these cuts are made.

2864
02:37:30.935 --> 02:37:34.545
Correct. Okay. Thank you. All righty.

2865
02:37:34.725 --> 02:37:38.105
Um, I think I am gonna go, since we're kind

2866
02:37:38.105 --> 02:37:41.425
of going right now, if they have any public comment, um,

2867
02:37:41.425 --> 02:37:43.105
the general public comment, if there's anyone,

2868
02:37:43.125 --> 02:37:44.905
if we have either in person or online,

2869
02:37:45.085 --> 02:37:47.785
and then I will call a quick break after that.

2870
02:37:48.245 --> 02:37:50.705
But, um, since we, if we have anyone for public comment,

2871
02:37:52.915 --> 02:37:55.535
if anyone wants to make a public comment for a general item,

2872
02:37:55.675 --> 02:37:57.655
please log in now.

2873
02:37:59.855 --> 02:38:03.035
Um, otherwise I think we are, I'm gonna take a quick break

2874
02:38:03.245 --> 02:38:04.875
until eight 15

2875
02:38:06.355 --> 02:38:10.455
and then we'll be back to continue with some board policies.

2876
02:45:38.855 --> 02:45:39.915
All righty. We are back

2877
02:45:40.175 --> 02:45:41.635
and I see Dr. Campbell,

2878
02:45:42.115 --> 02:45:44.395
I think the first board policy is from ED Services.

2879
02:45:44.705 --> 02:45:46.555
Yeah. Thank you President Pelham

2880
02:45:46.555 --> 02:45:48.355
and superintendent Funk, board of trustees

2881
02:45:48.355 --> 02:45:49.355
and members of the community.

2882
02:45:49.455 --> 02:45:51.755
I'd like to introduce Marco Taylor.

2883
02:45:51.895 --> 02:45:54.795
He is our Director of equity inclusion and student support.

2884
02:45:54.905 --> 02:45:56.195
He's actually gonna be up here

2885
02:45:56.195 --> 02:45:58.755
for the next two board policy revisions.

2886
02:45:59.375 --> 02:46:01.435
And so, uh, he's gonna take you home

2887
02:46:01.435 --> 02:46:02.515
on the next two board items.

2888
02:46:02.615 --> 02:46:04.035
So I wanna welcome Marco Taylor.

2889
02:46:10.245 --> 02:46:12.895
Good evening, president Pelham, superintendent Funk Board

2890
02:46:12.895 --> 02:46:14.655
of Trustees and Executive Cabinet.

2891
02:46:16.035 --> 02:46:18.935
Uh, tonight I bring to you the first reading of BP

2892
02:46:18.935 --> 02:46:22.175
and AR 5 1 32 titled Dress and Grooming.

2893
02:46:22.715 --> 02:46:24.815
Um, appropriate Dress and Grooming contribute

2894
02:46:24.815 --> 02:46:26.175
to a productive learning environment.

2895
02:46:26.675 --> 02:46:29.255
Uh, students are expected to wear clothing that is suitable

2896
02:46:29.395 --> 02:46:32.335
for school activities, and that does not present a health

2897
02:46:32.435 --> 02:46:33.575
or safety hazard

2898
02:46:34.435 --> 02:46:36.535
or cause a disruption to the educational process.

2899
02:46:36.915 --> 02:46:40.215
The policy also emphasizes that students must be allowed

2900
02:46:40.215 --> 02:46:41.815
to express their gender identity

2901
02:46:42.275 --> 02:46:44.415
or cultural beliefs, uh, through their clothing.

2902
02:46:45.405 --> 02:46:46.975
This year's revision of the dress

2903
02:46:46.975 --> 02:46:49.855
and grooming policy incorporates several important updates,

2904
02:46:50.725 --> 02:46:52.425
uh, one, inclusivity and dress.

2905
02:46:52.925 --> 02:46:54.865
Uh, we have expanded, uh, protections

2906
02:46:54.865 --> 02:46:58.185
to include hairstyles associated with cultural identity such

2907
02:46:58.185 --> 02:47:00.105
as bras, locks and twists, ensuring

2908
02:47:00.105 --> 02:47:03.305
that students are not discriminated against based on their

2909
02:47:03.335 --> 02:47:05.025
hair, texture or protective styles.

2910
02:47:05.205 --> 02:47:08.025
Uh, two, uh, respect for individual expression.

2911
02:47:08.445 --> 02:47:10.465
The policy now explicitly ensures

2912
02:47:10.465 --> 02:47:12.785
that students may dress in a manner consistent

2913
02:47:12.785 --> 02:47:13.865
with their gender identity.

2914
02:47:14.485 --> 02:47:16.785
Uh, this is a key step towards supporting all students

2915
02:47:16.805 --> 02:47:17.905
and respecting their rights.

2916
02:47:18.365 --> 02:47:20.425
And three, non-discriminatory enforcement.

2917
02:47:20.555 --> 02:47:22.545
We've added more specific language

2918
02:47:22.925 --> 02:47:26.025
to ensure the dress code is enforced equitably without bias

2919
02:47:26.395 --> 02:47:29.825
based on gender, race, body type, or household income.

2920
02:47:30.365 --> 02:47:32.345
We want to ensure fair treatment for all students,

2921
02:47:32.405 --> 02:47:35.105
and this policy update reflects that commitment.

2922
02:47:35.845 --> 02:47:37.305
Uh, in addition to these updates,

2923
02:47:37.325 --> 02:47:39.265
the ar outlines practical guidelines

2924
02:47:39.285 --> 02:47:40.585
for enforcing the dress code.

2925
02:47:40.765 --> 02:47:44.345
One example, uh, being, uh, clothing that promotes drug,

2926
02:47:44.375 --> 02:47:47.705
alcohol or illegal activities is prohibited as well

2927
02:47:47.705 --> 02:47:49.185
as any vulgar pro imagery.

2928
02:47:50.355 --> 02:47:53.775
We also emphasize, uh, dress code violations should not be,

2929
02:47:54.315 --> 02:47:55.495
uh, corrected in a manner

2930
02:47:55.495 --> 02:47:56.975
that disrupts the learning environment.

2931
02:47:59.075 --> 02:48:01.615
And, uh, for right now, thank you.

2932
02:48:01.725 --> 02:48:04.055
That is it for, uh, dress code

2933
02:48:04.635 --> 02:48:06.895
and grooming BPA R 5 1 32.

2934
02:48:07.435 --> 02:48:08.775
Uh, thank you for your attention

2935
02:48:08.835 --> 02:48:10.735
and I welcome any questions that you may have.

2936
02:48:13.985 --> 02:48:15.285
Uh, trustee Blackman.

2937
02:48:16.755 --> 02:48:18.345
Thank you. I'm glad this has come back.

2938
02:48:18.345 --> 02:48:20.025
I know I asked for something we related to dress

2939
02:48:20.025 --> 02:48:22.425
and grooming and, um, I just wanna share the reason why I

2940
02:48:22.425 --> 02:48:24.025
brought it back is because the level of complaints

2941
02:48:24.775 --> 02:48:26.065
both from family students

2942
02:48:26.065 --> 02:48:28.065
and teachers with regard to the fact

2943
02:48:28.065 --> 02:48:30.665
that there's a total lack of enforcement of the existing,

2944
02:48:31.005 --> 02:48:33.225
um, dress policies that we have on campus

2945
02:48:33.845 --> 02:48:36.105
and the level of distraction disruption in the classroom.

2946
02:48:36.125 --> 02:48:37.625
So I'm just relaying that information to you.

2947
02:48:37.685 --> 02:48:38.825
So I'm glad this came back.

2948
02:48:39.525 --> 02:48:43.505
Um, the one question I would have for you is how do we know,

2949
02:48:43.685 --> 02:48:46.425
for example, in some of the information here,

2950
02:48:46.535 --> 02:48:51.105
when you talk about enforcing, um, uh, dress,

2951
02:48:52.105 --> 02:48:55.305
I guess code or policy, when there's no specifics in it,

2952
02:48:55.305 --> 02:48:56.985
before we actually had specifics,

2953
02:48:56.985 --> 02:48:58.425
which gave our administrators

2954
02:48:58.565 --> 02:49:01.425
and site staff the ability to actually point

2955
02:49:01.445 --> 02:49:03.785
to something specifically without getting into trouble

2956
02:49:04.335 --> 02:49:07.645
with regard to those protected issues you mentioned right

2957
02:49:07.645 --> 02:49:10.125
now without any specifics listed in the documents,

2958
02:49:10.305 --> 02:49:13.205
our staff are led to making a judgment on what they think

2959
02:49:13.275 --> 02:49:14.965
that might be interpreted as.

2960
02:49:15.505 --> 02:49:18.005
And that's an easy flag for somebody to say, well,

2961
02:49:18.065 --> 02:49:20.285
you basically using my protected class,

2962
02:49:20.425 --> 02:49:23.085
or some aspect of your judgment of me to use

2963
02:49:23.705 --> 02:49:25.765
to basically flag me for the way I'm dressed.

2964
02:49:25.765 --> 02:49:28.805
When we actually provide specifics in here for our staff,

2965
02:49:29.435 --> 02:49:30.885
they can actually point to it.

2966
02:49:31.255 --> 02:49:33.725
Right now, I'm concerned that this is overly vague

2967
02:49:33.945 --> 02:49:35.645
and it would actually lead to less

2968
02:49:35.645 --> 02:49:37.645
and less enforcement of essentially nothing.

2969
02:49:38.345 --> 02:49:40.685
Um, I appreciate that you say appropriate dress,

2970
02:49:40.685 --> 02:49:41.965
but you have to define what that is.

2971
02:49:42.745 --> 02:49:44.545
So could you expand upon

2972
02:49:44.545 --> 02:49:46.905
what appropriate dress is on a school campus?

2973
02:49:49.425 --> 02:49:52.715
Yeah. Uh, so the question is you want a, a definition of

2974
02:49:52.715 --> 02:49:55.475
what appropriate dress means and how we can expand on that?

2975
02:49:55.985 --> 02:49:59.595
Yeah, I think, um, as we, we had an opportunity

2976
02:49:59.595 --> 02:50:01.675
to review this as at principal meetings

2977
02:50:01.675 --> 02:50:02.875
and at our cabinet meetings.

2978
02:50:02.875 --> 02:50:05.315
And one of the things that came up was, uh, ensuring

2979
02:50:05.315 --> 02:50:06.395
that the dress is not a

2980
02:50:06.395 --> 02:50:07.755
disruption to the learning environment.

2981
02:50:07.955 --> 02:50:09.675
I think, uh, we could take that,

2982
02:50:09.735 --> 02:50:11.315
we could take the definition

2983
02:50:11.315 --> 02:50:13.995
and opportunity to define appropriate dress

2984
02:50:14.055 --> 02:50:15.555
and, uh, take that under consideration

2985
02:50:15.555 --> 02:50:18.075
and see how we can revise this bp uh, to ensure

2986
02:50:18.075 --> 02:50:19.115
that that's more clearly defined.

2987
02:50:21.015 --> 02:50:22.785
Trustee spec, I'm sorry.

2988
02:50:22.845 --> 02:50:24.385
Um, I just had a couple more questions.

2989
02:50:24.445 --> 02:50:27.865
So, um, one of the things also that you noted in here is

2990
02:50:27.865 --> 02:50:30.185
that when practical, um, it's at the bottom of,

2991
02:50:30.265 --> 02:50:32.345
I think the BP students should not be directed

2992
02:50:32.345 --> 02:50:33.745
to correct dress code violations

2993
02:50:33.745 --> 02:50:35.505
during instructional time or in front of other students.

2994
02:50:35.745 --> 02:50:37.425
I can understand not wanting to embarrass the student,

2995
02:50:37.425 --> 02:50:39.305
obviously, but usually we're supposed

2996
02:50:39.305 --> 02:50:40.945
to flag students coming onto campus.

2997
02:50:41.885 --> 02:50:44.185
So one of the questions I have is if a student is coming

2998
02:50:44.185 --> 02:50:46.465
onto campus and they're not, whatever it is,

2999
02:50:46.785 --> 02:50:51.145
properly dressed, so to speak, um, if we don't capture that,

3000
02:50:51.195 --> 02:50:52.825
we're allowing them to go through school.

3001
02:50:52.965 --> 02:50:55.665
And this is one of the complaints I'm gonna relate to you is

3002
02:50:55.665 --> 02:50:57.625
that other students perceive that as favoritism

3003
02:50:57.775 --> 02:51:00.585
because nobody actually caught that person and stopped them,

3004
02:51:00.585 --> 02:51:01.785
and it's a distraction to others.

3005
02:51:01.885 --> 02:51:05.105
So how would you, if you're not allowing them

3006
02:51:05.285 --> 02:51:06.385
to pull the student out

3007
02:51:06.385 --> 02:51:08.425
and help them to address this dress code,

3008
02:51:08.425 --> 02:51:10.665
or if it's in the morning, how do we

3009
02:51:10.695 --> 02:51:12.025
stem that sort of behavior?

3010
02:51:12.025 --> 02:51:13.065
Are you meeting with a student?

3011
02:51:13.365 --> 02:51:15.025
Are you having a discussion with their parents?

3012
02:51:15.345 --> 02:51:17.345
I mean, what, what's the actual follow up so that

3013
02:51:17.965 --> 02:51:19.425
the behavior doesn't continue?

3014
02:51:19.625 --> 02:51:20.785
'cause obviously it's gonna be there for

3015
02:51:20.785 --> 02:51:23.425
that day distracting everybody and affecting everybody else.

3016
02:51:23.445 --> 02:51:24.905
So how do you actually get to it

3017
02:51:24.905 --> 02:51:26.665
before it actually creates this domino effect?

3018
02:51:26.685 --> 02:51:28.305
Is there some solution in here or process

3019
02:51:28.485 --> 02:51:30.105
or protocols that you can explain?

3020
02:51:30.295 --> 02:51:31.625
Because if we're not allowed

3021
02:51:31.625 --> 02:51:32.745
to actually address it at the time

3022
02:51:32.745 --> 02:51:34.265
and place on campus during instructional

3023
02:51:34.265 --> 02:51:35.345
time, then when, when do you

3024
02:51:36.525 --> 02:51:38.495
Yeah, I can speak to my interpretation of

3025
02:51:38.495 --> 02:51:42.335
what is written there and, um, my interpretation is instead

3026
02:51:42.335 --> 02:51:44.695
of, uh, correcting a student, uh, loudly

3027
02:51:44.695 --> 02:51:46.415
or on stage that, uh, there's a,

3028
02:51:46.695 --> 02:51:48.775
a private off stage conversation with that student,

3029
02:51:48.875 --> 02:51:51.415
if there's a violation of, uh, the dress code.

3030
02:51:55.055 --> 02:51:58.235
So in other words, as the former site administrator, uh,

3031
02:51:58.345 --> 02:51:59.915
instead of having teachers

3032
02:51:59.975 --> 02:52:02.115
or administrator call a student out

3033
02:52:02.415 --> 02:52:05.965
during class time in front of the class, you would take

3034
02:52:05.965 --> 02:52:07.805
that student aside, uh,

3035
02:52:08.065 --> 02:52:11.325
and either have a campus supervisor bring them to the office

3036
02:52:11.425 --> 02:52:14.285
to have the discussion, to provide them an opportunity

3037
02:52:14.505 --> 02:52:16.925
to change out if they have something in their backpack,

3038
02:52:17.265 --> 02:52:18.325
if you have a loaner

3039
02:52:18.505 --> 02:52:19.645
or if you need to call home

3040
02:52:19.665 --> 02:52:21.205
to have the family bring something.

3041
02:52:21.825 --> 02:52:25.565
That's what we mean by not interrupting the instructional,

3042
02:52:25.985 --> 02:52:27.645
um, time for other students.

3043
02:52:27.985 --> 02:52:30.125
So could I make the request then, then, rather than saying

3044
02:52:30.125 --> 02:52:32.005
what we're not gonna do, could we actually put into the

3045
02:52:32.165 --> 02:52:35.005
document what we are gonna do so that it's just clear

3046
02:52:35.065 --> 02:52:37.085
and the expectations for a student that's called out

3047
02:52:37.085 --> 02:52:39.125
of the room or has that side conversation,

3048
02:52:39.125 --> 02:52:42.805
that's the behavior that's expected as a result.

3049
02:52:42.865 --> 02:52:43.865
So

3050
02:52:44.445 --> 02:52:45.485
I don't think it's necessary.

3051
02:52:45.545 --> 02:52:47.685
If the rest of the board feels that it's necessary,

3052
02:52:47.735 --> 02:52:49.165
we'll take that into consideration.

3053
02:52:51.255 --> 02:52:52.875
One other question I had was that, um,

3054
02:52:53.135 --> 02:52:55.515
in the discussion about gang related apparel,

3055
02:52:55.785 --> 02:52:58.475
there's also this little piece that talks about, um,

3056
02:52:59.575 --> 02:53:01.995
interpretation in the last paragraph of

3057
02:53:01.995 --> 02:53:04.835
that section about bias based on race, ethnicity,

3058
02:53:05.115 --> 02:53:06.475
national origin, immigration status,

3059
02:53:06.495 --> 02:53:08.675
or other protected character characteristics.

3060
02:53:09.495 --> 02:53:11.075
And the possibility that, not

3061
02:53:11.075 --> 02:53:12.355
that we would have these students here,

3062
02:53:12.415 --> 02:53:14.235
but there are these gaps in understanding

3063
02:53:14.235 --> 02:53:17.595
or conflicts where essentially we don't allow gang gang

3064
02:53:17.965 --> 02:53:20.595
dress and we don't necessarily describe what that is.

3065
02:53:20.715 --> 02:53:22.035
I I don't know how anybody would know

3066
02:53:22.035 --> 02:53:22.875
unless it's somewhere

3067
02:53:22.875 --> 02:53:24.235
that somebody would be able to identify.

3068
02:53:24.575 --> 02:53:26.475
And that leaves up to the teacher to understand what

3069
02:53:26.475 --> 02:53:27.595
that is without a reference point.

3070
02:53:27.895 --> 02:53:29.595
But in the case of the person just happens

3071
02:53:29.595 --> 02:53:31.675
to be an immigrant, but also a member of the gang,

3072
02:53:32.855 --> 02:53:34.755
how do you address that when somebody is actually an

3073
02:53:34.755 --> 02:53:37.395
immigrant but also a member of a gang wearing gang wear,

3074
02:53:37.415 --> 02:53:38.515
but an immigrant that feels

3075
02:53:38.635 --> 02:53:40.395
that they have a protected class status

3076
02:53:40.505 --> 02:53:43.915
that prevents you from telling them to take off that outfit

3077
02:53:43.915 --> 02:53:45.355
that they're wearing that is gang.

3078
02:53:46.415 --> 02:53:47.635
I'm just saying, not that we're gonna have it,

3079
02:53:47.635 --> 02:53:49.835
but there's some con conflicts in the writing here

3080
02:53:49.835 --> 02:53:50.475
that don't make

3081
02:53:50.475 --> 02:53:52.235
clarification as to where the priorities are.

3082
02:53:55.345 --> 02:53:58.325
Um, let me try to address this.

3083
02:53:58.415 --> 02:54:03.325
There is ed code that allows us, uh, to identify

3084
02:54:04.005 --> 02:54:08.085
specific, um, identifiable gang related, uh,

3085
02:54:08.785 --> 02:54:13.465
um, clothing that is not protected under a certain class.

3086
02:54:14.205 --> 02:54:16.185
And so if I'm an immigrant

3087
02:54:16.445 --> 02:54:19.465
and I'm naturally attracted to a potential gang,

3088
02:54:19.725 --> 02:54:22.905
it is our responsibility to educate that individual

3089
02:54:22.965 --> 02:54:26.225
and that family by wearing those type of clothings

3090
02:54:26.225 --> 02:54:29.745
that have been identified professionally as gang related.

3091
02:54:30.375 --> 02:54:34.465
What that will, the potential impact that that new student

3092
02:54:34.685 --> 02:54:37.065
to our country, to our school system,

3093
02:54:37.565 --> 02:54:39.745
how it could play in a negative effect on them.

3094
02:54:39.885 --> 02:54:41.985
So it's our responsibility to help educate them.

3095
02:54:42.295 --> 02:54:44.825
Awesome. On the ar I know this

3096
02:54:44.825 --> 02:54:46.105
doesn't fall under our purview.

3097
02:54:46.485 --> 02:54:49.545
One of the things they didn't find in detail were we do have

3098
02:54:49.545 --> 02:54:51.865
requirements for special types of courses,

3099
02:54:52.165 --> 02:54:53.385
for example, in labs.

3100
02:54:53.605 --> 02:54:55.665
And when we're using equipment, it's very dangerous

3101
02:54:55.665 --> 02:54:58.265
for students to have their hair down, to have long sleeves,

3102
02:54:58.265 --> 02:54:59.385
to have open toed shoes.

3103
02:54:59.845 --> 02:55:01.985
In some cases in chemistry, it's also dangerous

3104
02:55:01.985 --> 02:55:03.845
to have long not to have long sleeves.

3105
02:55:04.185 --> 02:55:05.885
But I don't see in here like a writeup

3106
02:55:05.885 --> 02:55:07.725
that actually discusses the fact

3107
02:55:07.725 --> 02:55:10.165
that there are perhaps specific dress

3108
02:55:10.185 --> 02:55:13.045
and apparel that's required when you are taking those

3109
02:55:13.045 --> 02:55:15.365
courses, whether you define it later on

3110
02:55:15.365 --> 02:55:17.045
or in this document, it needs to be called out

3111
02:55:17.045 --> 02:55:19.445
that they're going to be exceptions that where we're going

3112
02:55:19.445 --> 02:55:22.165
to have to define, like, for example, in pe

3113
02:55:22.725 --> 02:55:25.525
although we provide, um, sports, um, clothing,

3114
02:55:26.065 --> 02:55:28.285
we don't necessarily prohibit a student from wearing

3115
02:55:28.285 --> 02:55:30.165
something from home if they're not going

3116
02:55:30.165 --> 02:55:32.085
to purchase those items, which is very understandable.

3117
02:55:32.625 --> 02:55:35.525
But when it comes to safety, I actually think we need

3118
02:55:35.525 --> 02:55:37.565
to include things which give our teachers

3119
02:55:37.565 --> 02:55:39.525
and staff the ability to mandate when those

3120
02:55:39.885 --> 02:55:41.165
things must be done.

3121
02:55:41.825 --> 02:55:44.405
Um, where they don't get punished for calling a student out

3122
02:55:44.405 --> 02:55:46.165
that has their hair down when they need it up

3123
02:55:46.165 --> 02:55:48.405
because they're working on a piece of equipment or in a lab.

3124
02:55:48.625 --> 02:55:49.765
So if you could possibly

3125
02:55:49.765 --> 02:55:50.925
add that, that'd be great. Thank you.

3126
02:55:51.625 --> 02:55:54.995
Yep. Noted. Thank you. Trustee speck.

3127
02:55:55.935 --> 02:56:00.275
Um, I just wanna point out, I, I like the lack of, um, rules

3128
02:56:00.305 --> 02:56:02.515
that aren't going to be enforced at schools.

3129
02:56:02.855 --> 02:56:07.125
So, um, I I think that, um, we need

3130
02:56:07.125 --> 02:56:08.365
to focus on educating

3131
02:56:08.365 --> 02:56:10.885
and not on telling people to go home and change clothes.

3132
02:56:11.185 --> 02:56:13.365
Um, unless it's grossly, you know,

3133
02:56:14.355 --> 02:56:15.965
like clothings should be

3134
02:56:16.165 --> 02:56:17.365
sufficient to conceal undergarments.

3135
02:56:17.365 --> 02:56:20.125
So I appreciate that we took off a number of these

3136
02:56:20.125 --> 02:56:23.005
because, um, they were written here,

3137
02:56:23.025 --> 02:56:25.485
but then they were sporadically enforced, um,

3138
02:56:25.485 --> 02:56:26.885
which was just confusing to students.

3139
02:56:27.305 --> 02:56:31.445
So my question is, if we approve this at the next meeting,

3140
02:56:31.985 --> 02:56:35.165
um, are we then expecting every site to come

3141
02:56:35.165 --> 02:56:36.685
with different dress codes?

3142
02:56:36.845 --> 02:56:39.885
'cause many of the dress codes have things in there

3143
02:56:39.955 --> 02:56:42.405
that are no longer in these documents.

3144
02:56:43.025 --> 02:56:44.285
So are we expecting that change

3145
02:56:44.345 --> 02:56:45.885
and will that be communicated to the public?

3146
02:56:46.115 --> 02:56:48.925
Yeah, no, I, if I'm understanding your question, one

3147
02:56:48.925 --> 02:56:50.165
of the things that we wanna do is make sure

3148
02:56:50.165 --> 02:56:51.285
that this is clearly stated

3149
02:56:51.545 --> 02:56:54.485
and, uh, all of our site's handbooks and that we are uniform

3150
02:56:54.645 --> 02:56:55.965
and unified and what the

3151
02:56:55.965 --> 02:56:57.485
expectations are across the district.

3152
02:56:57.705 --> 02:57:00.445
So you shouldn't see it should be very similar across sites.

3153
02:57:00.995 --> 02:57:02.845
Well, I'm thinking like there's specific ones

3154
02:57:02.845 --> 02:57:04.245
around the length of your shorts

3155
02:57:04.345 --> 02:57:06.165
and when you stand straight with your arms,

3156
02:57:06.185 --> 02:57:09.365
and it must come to your thumb, that's not in this ar

3157
02:57:09.365 --> 02:57:11.165
that's not in this board policy that shouldn't,

3158
02:57:11.185 --> 02:57:13.085
in my opinion, not be allowed in a dress code.

3159
02:57:13.085 --> 02:57:15.605
Is that, would that be accurate to your belief of

3160
02:57:15.605 --> 02:57:16.725
what is from this?

3161
02:57:17.575 --> 02:57:19.935
I think that example that you're giving speaks to you

3162
02:57:20.125 --> 02:57:23.255
what was stated as the vagueness of the word appropriate.

3163
02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:27.175
Right. And, um, I don't, we have not decided to go into

3164
02:57:27.175 --> 02:57:30.375
that type of detail in terms of, uh, the six inch rule

3165
02:57:30.375 --> 02:57:31.975
with say, address or a skirt.

3166
02:57:32.315 --> 02:57:34.895
Um, and I think a big part of that was, uh, due

3167
02:57:34.895 --> 02:57:36.535
to enforcement and evenness

3168
02:57:36.555 --> 02:57:38.295
of enforcement across school sites

3169
02:57:38.395 --> 02:57:40.295
and different grade levels and, and the district.

3170
02:57:41.195 --> 02:57:43.575
So yeah. So my answer is no, we,

3171
02:57:43.715 --> 02:57:46.335
we have not chosen to go that route. Right?

3172
02:57:46.335 --> 02:57:47.375
So we have not in here.

3173
02:57:47.555 --> 02:57:49.335
So would you agree

3174
02:57:49.365 --> 02:57:52.415
that the expectation is a dress code would not be allowed

3175
02:57:52.415 --> 02:57:55.815
to state those things because it's not, um, in these,

3176
02:57:56.335 --> 02:57:59.135
I, you know, my opinion is I, I am fine with the way

3177
02:57:59.135 --> 02:58:01.175
that it is written and I don't think that it is necessary

3178
02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:02.485
to put that in the ar.

3179
02:58:03.985 --> 02:58:05.835
Okay. But what about the dress code at the site?

3180
02:58:06.105 --> 02:58:07.155
What about the dress code at

3181
02:58:07.155 --> 02:58:08.155
The site? Can they

3182
02:58:08.155 --> 02:58:10.515
specifically say your shorts must have your

3183
02:58:10.515 --> 02:58:13.825
hand straight into your thumb? Is that okay,

3184
02:58:14.165 --> 02:58:15.165
Dr. Camp? Feel free to jump

3185
02:58:15.165 --> 02:58:16.065
in. Um,

3186
02:58:16.165 --> 02:58:17.505
But I have, because I don't think it is,

3187
02:58:17.845 --> 02:58:19.945
but I guess I'm wanting, I'm wanting to hear someone.

3188
02:58:20.385 --> 02:58:21.945
I agree with you. So I think that, uh,

3189
02:58:22.005 --> 02:58:23.585
we have a principal's meeting coming up,

3190
02:58:23.585 --> 02:58:25.785
and I don't want us to

3191
02:58:26.365 --> 02:58:28.665
be beholden into specifically when we're gonna

3192
02:58:28.665 --> 02:58:29.785
start, uh, changing.

3193
02:58:30.245 --> 02:58:32.585
But we definitely need to start having the conversations

3194
02:58:32.585 --> 02:58:34.545
with the site principals in terms of,

3195
02:58:34.685 --> 02:58:37.345
and just being, like Marco said, be more uniform

3196
02:58:38.045 --> 02:58:41.945
and some of these site specific things with, you know,

3197
02:58:41.995 --> 02:58:43.625
going down to the mid thigh

3198
02:58:43.625 --> 02:58:45.665
or whatever, we just, we need, we need to eliminate that.

3199
02:58:45.725 --> 02:58:47.145
So we all need to be more uniform.

3200
02:58:47.865 --> 02:58:51.055
Great. And then we avoid this, Hey, we have a dress code,

3201
02:58:51.155 --> 02:58:52.895
but how much is it enforced?

3202
02:58:53.095 --> 02:58:54.655
'cause you know, it's, it's confusing.

3203
02:58:54.655 --> 02:58:58.655
It's confusing to parents. Um, it's concerning to kids who,

3204
02:58:59.115 --> 02:59:01.095
you know, are trying to follow the rules. And

3205
02:59:01.355 --> 02:59:02.575
So I think, I think we have plenty

3206
02:59:02.575 --> 02:59:05.015
of opportunities at our principal meetings, AP meetings to,

3207
02:59:05.015 --> 02:59:06.855
to calibrate on expectations

3208
02:59:07.275 --> 02:59:08.655
and enforcement of expectations.

3209
02:59:08.805 --> 02:59:11.175
Okay. Yeah. So then as I look at this AR

3210
02:59:11.235 --> 02:59:13.015
and I see how many things are crossed off,

3211
02:59:13.645 --> 02:59:17.495
then the expectation is that these principles will be taking

3212
02:59:17.495 --> 02:59:20.975
that guidance and will be crossing things off their dress

3213
02:59:20.985 --> 02:59:22.815
codes as well so that they're in alignment

3214
02:59:23.485 --> 02:59:25.255
with this board policy and ar assuming

3215
02:59:25.255 --> 02:59:26.695
that it is approved at the next meeting.

3216
02:59:26.725 --> 02:59:28.415
Yeah, I think that's the direction we wanna move in

3217
02:59:28.415 --> 02:59:30.175
alignment and calibration. Yes. Great.

3218
02:59:30.465 --> 02:59:32.415
Thank you Trustee Blackman?

3219
02:59:33.615 --> 02:59:35.335
I beg to differ. I actually think

3220
02:59:35.475 --> 02:59:37.655
by forcing individual school sites

3221
02:59:37.795 --> 02:59:41.255
to be limited does not respond effectively to the culture

3222
02:59:41.395 --> 02:59:43.015
of the community that those sites serve.

3223
02:59:43.755 --> 02:59:46.215
I'm hearing very different comments from the community on

3224
02:59:46.215 --> 02:59:48.295
the east side that would like to be able

3225
02:59:48.295 --> 02:59:51.575
to have some more restrictive, more modest types of clothing

3226
02:59:51.965 --> 02:59:54.175
that do not sexualize the classroom.

3227
02:59:54.885 --> 02:59:56.025
We don't want our classrooms

3228
02:59:56.025 --> 02:59:58.345
to look like TikTok videos being like shot.

3229
02:59:58.365 --> 02:59:59.465
We would like them to look like

3230
02:59:59.465 --> 03:00:00.865
classrooms where learning occurs.

3231
03:00:01.285 --> 03:00:02.745
So there's been a bit of a backlash.

3232
03:00:03.005 --> 03:00:04.025
And part of the problem is

3233
03:00:04.025 --> 03:00:07.065
because it, I guess this transition to a different type of,

3234
03:00:07.085 --> 03:00:09.305
uh, dress code was being slowly ruled out

3235
03:00:09.765 --> 03:00:11.105
and nothing was being enforced.

3236
03:00:11.645 --> 03:00:16.425
And so some boys one day decide to wear bras to school just

3237
03:00:16.425 --> 03:00:18.425
to see if anybody would dress code them and they didn't.

3238
03:00:18.925 --> 03:00:21.625
So students actually think it's a farce right now.

3239
03:00:21.965 --> 03:00:23.625
So if you're not experiencing this,

3240
03:00:23.745 --> 03:00:25.105
I suggest you go into the classrooms

3241
03:00:25.105 --> 03:00:26.985
and talk to teachers about how disruptive it's become,

3242
03:00:27.575 --> 03:00:29.585
because I, if you're going to leave it to sites,

3243
03:00:29.615 --> 03:00:30.985
then give them the freedom to do

3244
03:00:30.985 --> 03:00:31.985
what their communities asked them.

3245
03:00:32.315 --> 03:00:33.315
Thank you.

3246
03:00:34.085 --> 03:00:37.105
So yeah, I believe very, I was very happy to see all

3247
03:00:37.105 --> 03:00:38.425
of these things eliminated in here.

3248
03:00:38.705 --> 03:00:42.105
I think what students choose to wear is up to the students

3249
03:00:42.685 --> 03:00:46.425
as long as it's not drugs or alcohol or violence, um,

3250
03:00:46.725 --> 03:00:48.145
or, you know,

3251
03:00:50.585 --> 03:00:54.555
like vulgar kind of just, I, I I think

3252
03:00:54.865 --> 03:00:58.065
what certain shorts are on one body type versus another, I,

3253
03:00:58.105 --> 03:00:59.685
I think it's not our purview.

3254
03:01:00.265 --> 03:01:03.325
And I think if students wanna dress more conservatively,

3255
03:01:03.325 --> 03:01:06.365
that is absolutely their right and their ability to do so.

3256
03:01:06.625 --> 03:01:09.285
And if they wanna dress 'cause it's really hot

3257
03:01:09.285 --> 03:01:10.565
and they wanna wear short shorts

3258
03:01:10.565 --> 03:01:12.245
and that's what they have as long

3259
03:01:12.245 --> 03:01:16.485
as they are not showing underwear and swearing and,

3260
03:01:16.505 --> 03:01:18.565
and that kind of a thing, I

3261
03:01:19.245 --> 03:01:22.165
absolutely support not micromanaging.

3262
03:01:22.745 --> 03:01:26.565
Um, I think historically this has been very gendered

3263
03:01:27.025 --> 03:01:28.925
and I have major issues with that.

3264
03:01:29.665 --> 03:01:33.485
And so the fact that that came off I think is really great

3265
03:01:33.485 --> 03:01:38.245
to see because I think you are responsible for yourself

3266
03:01:38.305 --> 03:01:42.485
and your learning and blaming what other people are wearing

3267
03:01:42.485 --> 03:01:44.005
around you for your not learning,

3268
03:01:44.205 --> 03:01:45.925
I think is not taking responsibility.

3269
03:01:46.305 --> 03:01:50.475
So I absolutely support the elimination of

3270
03:01:50.985 --> 03:01:54.615
various, you know, halt and whatever tops

3271
03:01:54.635 --> 03:01:56.255
and lengths of shorts

3272
03:01:56.275 --> 03:01:59.015
and how are, you know, like all the ways we used to get

3273
03:01:59.015 --> 03:02:00.975
around it and whose arms are longer.

3274
03:02:01.175 --> 03:02:05.215
I just, it it becomes so objective,

3275
03:02:05.355 --> 03:02:06.855
so subjective and not objective.

3276
03:02:07.075 --> 03:02:10.055
And at, in the end of the day, everyone's responsible for

3277
03:02:10.055 --> 03:02:11.575
what, what they're wearing.

3278
03:02:12.675 --> 03:02:15.535
Um, and I don't believe that it is our job to

3279
03:02:17.115 --> 03:02:19.215
be the morality police in terms of

3280
03:02:20.115 --> 03:02:21.655
how tight something can be or whatever.

3281
03:02:21.995 --> 03:02:26.495
Um, so I was really happy to see a lot of this eliminated

3282
03:02:26.515 --> 03:02:29.135
and I hope that it will then carry down to the sites

3283
03:02:29.275 --> 03:02:33.015
and say, as long as it's not showing underwear,

3284
03:02:33.735 --> 03:02:36.495
swearing on all those things, doing alcohol, you know,

3285
03:02:36.495 --> 03:02:41.265
having promoting alcohol, then you know, you,

3286
03:02:41.325 --> 03:02:42.865
you wear what is comfortable for you.

3287
03:02:43.605 --> 03:02:45.865
Um, so I absolutely will support this

3288
03:02:46.085 --> 03:02:48.665
and, um, believe it is a move in the right direction

3289
03:02:48.665 --> 03:02:50.465
to support students.

3290
03:02:55.065 --> 03:02:57.685
So this is a first reading on this one, right?

3291
03:02:58.305 --> 03:03:00.125
So this will come back next meeting. Mm-Hmm.

3292
03:03:01.065 --> 03:03:03.245
Um, go from there. And then the next one.

3293
03:03:05.515 --> 03:03:07.205
Alright, major change of tone.

3294
03:03:07.715 --> 03:03:08.845
Yeah, change of tone.

3295
03:03:09.265 --> 03:03:11.365
Uh, the next one is suicide prevention and BP

3296
03:03:11.585 --> 03:03:14.885
and AR 5 1 4, 1 0.52.

3297
03:03:15.705 --> 03:03:17.165
And, uh, suicide is one

3298
03:03:17.165 --> 03:03:18.965
of the leading causes of death among youth.

3299
03:03:19.265 --> 03:03:21.485
As such, the district has developed a, a policy

3300
03:03:21.585 --> 03:03:23.805
to address prevention, uh, intervention

3301
03:03:23.825 --> 03:03:26.925
and postvention strategies, ensuring that we provide a safe

3302
03:03:26.925 --> 03:03:28.765
and supportive environment for all of our students.

3303
03:03:29.745 --> 03:03:32.325
Uh, this year's revision includes significant updates aimed

3304
03:03:32.325 --> 03:03:34.325
at strengthening our suicide prevention efforts.

3305
03:03:34.785 --> 03:03:37.725
Uh, one is expanding expanded training requirements.

3306
03:03:37.785 --> 03:03:40.165
All staff will now receive annual suicide prevention

3307
03:03:40.365 --> 03:03:42.245
training, including teachers, counselors, and coaches.

3308
03:03:42.745 --> 03:03:45.045
Uh, this training will also cover identifying at-risk

3309
03:03:45.205 --> 03:03:46.925
students and offering appropriate referrals.

3310
03:03:48.165 --> 03:03:51.005
Specific groups of employees who have frequent interaction

3311
03:03:51.005 --> 03:03:53.165
with students such as mental health staff, uh,

3312
03:03:53.165 --> 03:03:55.605
will receive additional targeted training, uh,

3313
03:03:56.105 --> 03:03:57.125
for student education.

3314
03:03:57.345 --> 03:03:59.925
Uh, we are incorporating suicide prevention lessons into the

3315
03:03:59.925 --> 03:04:02.165
health curriculum, ensuring that students are equipped

3316
03:04:02.165 --> 03:04:03.965
with tools to recognize, uh,

3317
03:04:03.965 --> 03:04:05.485
warning signs in themselves and others.

3318
03:04:05.585 --> 03:04:07.565
Uh, the curriculum will focus on building resiliency

3319
03:04:07.905 --> 03:04:11.315
and coping skills and three postvention strategies.

3320
03:04:11.335 --> 03:04:13.635
Uh, the updated policy emphasizes the importance

3321
03:04:13.635 --> 03:04:16.635
of postvention, uh, providing counseling and support

3322
03:04:16.635 --> 03:04:19.835
after suicide or attempt to help students, staff

3323
03:04:19.975 --> 03:04:21.315
and families cope with grief

3324
03:04:21.375 --> 03:04:23.955
and reduce the risk of suicide, uh, contagion.

3325
03:04:25.085 --> 03:04:27.585
And then the ar the ar touches on staff development.

3326
03:04:27.605 --> 03:04:29.505
Uh, suicide prevention training, uh,

3327
03:04:29.505 --> 03:04:30.705
will be offered at least once per year

3328
03:04:30.705 --> 03:04:32.225
and staff will be trained to identify

3329
03:04:32.225 --> 03:04:33.505
mental health services available.

3330
03:04:34.605 --> 03:04:36.985
Um, training will include specific topics such

3331
03:04:36.985 --> 03:04:38.145
as recognizing depression

3332
03:04:38.145 --> 03:04:39.385
and other emotional distress,

3333
03:04:39.385 --> 03:04:41.465
especially in high risk groups, uh,

3334
03:04:41.465 --> 03:04:43.705
like students in foster care and those with mental health

3335
03:04:43.805 --> 03:04:45.105
or substance abuse issues.

3336
03:04:46.085 --> 03:04:47.985
Uh, the goal of this policy is

3337
03:04:47.985 --> 03:04:49.185
to ensure a proactive approach

3338
03:04:49.365 --> 03:04:51.065
to suicide prevention while supporting

3339
03:04:51.065 --> 03:04:52.705
those impacted by suicide.

3340
03:04:53.085 --> 03:04:55.345
And again, I'm, I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

3341
03:05:02.265 --> 03:05:04.265
I don't have any questions. Um, trustee Lockman.

3342
03:05:05.155 --> 03:05:08.175
Hi. So, um, throughout some of the documents, I noticed

3343
03:05:08.205 --> 03:05:10.015
that there's a lot of processes

3344
03:05:10.015 --> 03:05:14.135
and steps that bypass communication directly

3345
03:05:14.135 --> 03:05:15.975
with parents upon notification

3346
03:05:15.975 --> 03:05:18.255
that a student is either thinking about it

3347
03:05:18.315 --> 03:05:20.775
or in the process of, or has been stopped.

3348
03:05:21.475 --> 03:05:23.535
Um, I just sort of wanna understand, we,

3349
03:05:23.675 --> 03:05:26.935
we talk about trying to intervene at some point,

3350
03:05:27.035 --> 03:05:29.815
but I didn't see a lot of information here that said

3351
03:05:29.815 --> 03:05:32.615
that the i the first, the second person we contact

3352
03:05:32.665 --> 03:05:33.975
would be the parent or the guardian.

3353
03:05:34.355 --> 03:05:36.255
And so I wanna find out why.

3354
03:05:38.525 --> 03:05:40.495
Yeah. So if a, if a student is, um,

3355
03:05:40.835 --> 03:05:42.015
if a student mentions those comments

3356
03:05:42.075 --> 03:05:44.295
or having those thoughts, um, one of the first things

3357
03:05:44.295 --> 03:05:46.535
that we do as a school site is we do reach out

3358
03:05:46.535 --> 03:05:47.935
to the parents and we communicate with them.

3359
03:05:48.155 --> 03:05:49.935
Is there a specific space in the BP

3360
03:05:49.935 --> 03:05:51.175
that you're referencing? Yeah,

3361
03:05:51.405 --> 03:05:53.575
It's out actually throughout a lot of it.

3362
03:05:53.715 --> 03:05:56.415
So I would probably like to do it as a sidebar discussion.

3363
03:05:56.525 --> 03:05:59.015
Okay. Um, because it doesn't seem like we call it out

3364
03:05:59.015 --> 03:06:00.055
throughout the document.

3365
03:06:00.375 --> 03:06:03.095
'cause I almost wrote on every paragraph that says things

3366
03:06:03.095 --> 03:06:05.095
where we're gonna implement and talk to counselors

3367
03:06:05.095 --> 03:06:06.135
and designated reporter,

3368
03:06:06.155 --> 03:06:08.335
but then there's nothing about talking to the parents.

3369
03:06:09.255 --> 03:06:10.435
So it's more throughout.

3370
03:06:10.435 --> 03:06:12.315
But I'd be happy to do as a sidebar discussion

3371
03:06:12.315 --> 03:06:13.435
to just point to where it is.

3372
03:06:13.575 --> 03:06:14.795
Can I just clarify, this is about

3373
03:06:14.795 --> 03:06:18.445
what we're training our staff to do, right?

3374
03:06:18.635 --> 03:06:20.805
This is staff training we're providing,

3375
03:06:21.155 --> 03:06:22.885
Well, yeah, it's staff and yes.

3376
03:06:22.975 --> 03:06:25.645
Staff. And, uh, we are talking about what we're doing

3377
03:06:25.645 --> 03:06:28.085
as a district to make sure that we have clear processes in

3378
03:06:28.085 --> 03:06:30.525
place for, um, prevention intervention and,

3379
03:06:30.545 --> 03:06:31.845
and the postvention Yes.

3380
03:06:32.295 --> 03:06:33.445
Addressing staff training.

3381
03:06:33.465 --> 03:06:35.445
And, uh, a part of that is talking about

3382
03:06:35.445 --> 03:06:37.205
what we're doing in terms of, um,

3383
03:06:37.615 --> 03:06:39.805
supporting our students too with the curriculum as well.

3384
03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:44.265
Okay. Mm-Hmm, second. Sorry, did you have other questions?

3385
03:06:44.605 --> 03:06:46.785
Yes, I do. So, um, I'm trying to remember,

3386
03:06:46.785 --> 03:06:48.545
which I didn't label the pages, so I apologize.

3387
03:06:48.545 --> 03:06:51.585
Second to last page on the ar there is, um,

3388
03:06:52.155 --> 03:06:53.705
where students returning to school.

3389
03:06:54.205 --> 03:06:57.085
Um, we have in this paragraph it's above Postvention.

3390
03:06:57.615 --> 03:07:00.965
We're talking about use, it appears to be written

3391
03:07:01.035 --> 03:07:02.765
that we're reviewing whether

3392
03:07:02.765 --> 03:07:04.845
or not it's appropriate for a student to come back

3393
03:07:04.845 --> 03:07:06.445
through either the principal designee

3394
03:07:06.445 --> 03:07:07.725
or the school counselor.

3395
03:07:08.105 --> 03:07:09.845
But it's my understanding that only a physician

3396
03:07:09.985 --> 03:07:13.045
or possibly if the student is se seeking help

3397
03:07:13.235 --> 03:07:14.605
with a psychiatrist, that only

3398
03:07:14.605 --> 03:07:17.445
that person would actually be authorized to tell us

3399
03:07:17.445 --> 03:07:18.725
that the student is able

3400
03:07:18.785 --> 03:07:20.445
and capable of returning back to school.

3401
03:07:20.545 --> 03:07:22.565
Is that correct? Would we actually

3402
03:07:23.505 --> 03:07:25.325
not accept a physician letter saying

3403
03:07:25.325 --> 03:07:28.205
that the student's totally capable of returning to school?

3404
03:07:30.675 --> 03:07:33.305
Well, we would accept,

3405
03:07:33.365 --> 03:07:35.865
we would accept the physician's letter saying that they are,

3406
03:07:36.325 --> 03:07:39.805
uh, typically, um, that is, that's not the case

3407
03:07:39.805 --> 03:07:41.045
or how it plays out in the school.

3408
03:07:41.045 --> 03:07:43.165
Typically, how it plays out in the school is we make sure

3409
03:07:43.165 --> 03:07:45.565
that there, there isn't a plan in place for that student.

3410
03:07:45.865 --> 03:07:47.365
Um, and that that student is monitored

3411
03:07:47.385 --> 03:07:49.885
and, uh, their supportive measures at the school site, um,

3412
03:07:50.975 --> 03:07:53.285
after that student returns and while that student goes home.

3413
03:07:53.285 --> 03:07:56.125
And there's a plan between, uh, the administration, uh,

3414
03:07:56.225 --> 03:07:58.325
the counselors and the family to make sure that

3415
03:07:58.325 --> 03:08:00.045
that student is safe when they come home

3416
03:08:00.045 --> 03:08:01.245
and that their supportive measures

3417
03:08:01.245 --> 03:08:02.285
once they return back to school.

3418
03:08:04.175 --> 03:08:06.235
But do we require a letter from a doctor

3419
03:08:06.235 --> 03:08:09.395
or physician that states that they're healthy

3420
03:08:09.395 --> 03:08:10.675
and well enough to return to school?

3421
03:08:10.675 --> 03:08:12.395
We do that for other medical issues,

3422
03:08:12.895 --> 03:08:14.115
but we don't do it in this case.

3423
03:08:14.255 --> 03:08:15.515
No, that's, that's not a requirement.

3424
03:08:19.475 --> 03:08:20.925
I'll have comments later. But the,

3425
03:08:24.295 --> 03:08:26.075
Are there any other questions?

3426
03:08:29.005 --> 03:08:32.025
Do you have any public comment? Nope. All right.

3427
03:08:33.295 --> 03:08:37.075
Um, do you wanna make your comments now or

3428
03:08:38.015 --> 03:08:39.195
If there are no public comments?

3429
03:08:39.195 --> 03:08:40.355
Sure. Yeah. You said there wasn't.

3430
03:08:40.415 --> 03:08:41.835
So, um, one of the things

3431
03:08:41.865 --> 03:08:44.475
that I was a little bit concerned about, obviously we have

3432
03:08:44.475 --> 03:08:46.075
to do, uh, suicide prevention,

3433
03:08:46.495 --> 03:08:49.795
but based on stats, nationwide stats in terms of, um,

3434
03:08:50.195 --> 03:08:52.155
actually the highest, um, causation

3435
03:08:52.335 --> 03:08:55.235
of youth death is actually, um, accident.

3436
03:08:55.585 --> 03:09:00.155
It's about 57%, 21% is suicide and 20% is homicide.

3437
03:09:00.505 --> 03:09:03.835
Most of that is relegated to the, um, extensive use

3438
03:09:03.835 --> 03:09:06.235
of firearms or access to firearms, if you can believe it.

3439
03:09:06.405 --> 03:09:08.875
Gangs and other violence, which we may not,

3440
03:09:09.175 --> 03:09:10.675
we may not see in this community,

3441
03:09:10.695 --> 03:09:12.995
but, um, it seems like the largest number

3442
03:09:12.995 --> 03:09:15.075
of deaths in children in 2020 was firearm,

3443
03:09:15.285 --> 03:09:18.275
motor vehicle crash, drug overdose, suffocation, drowning,

3444
03:09:18.275 --> 03:09:20.515
heart disease, and other chronic diseases.

3445
03:09:20.935 --> 03:09:23.195
So suicide is a very small number based on the data

3446
03:09:23.195 --> 03:09:25.115
of population statistics that were

3447
03:09:25.315 --> 03:09:27.235
provided by New England Journal of Medicine.

3448
03:09:28.015 --> 03:09:31.195
We would have, based on the ratio of our students, one third

3449
03:09:31.195 --> 03:09:33.075
of a student would actually be capable in

3450
03:09:33.075 --> 03:09:34.395
our district of committ suicide.

3451
03:09:34.415 --> 03:09:36.995
So if you think about that,

3452
03:09:36.995 --> 03:09:38.755
that'd be one every three years maybe.

3453
03:09:39.375 --> 03:09:42.235
So I want us to also consider having taken

3454
03:09:42.785 --> 03:09:47.435
courses in college on the subject of psychology is

3455
03:09:47.435 --> 03:09:50.275
that when we consistently discuss something in front

3456
03:09:50.275 --> 03:09:52.435
of students, we're actually participating in

3457
03:09:52.435 --> 03:09:53.445
putting that in their, in their mind.

3458
03:09:54.125 --> 03:09:57.305
So I understand we need to talk about, um, prevention

3459
03:09:57.725 --> 03:09:58.945
and access to students,

3460
03:09:59.005 --> 03:10:01.225
but also on the cards that students carry.

3461
03:10:01.225 --> 03:10:02.585
We have a suicide hotline.

3462
03:10:02.765 --> 03:10:03.905
That's a really great way

3463
03:10:03.925 --> 03:10:05.225
to actually remind students all

3464
03:10:05.225 --> 03:10:06.345
the time that it's an option.

3465
03:10:06.925 --> 03:10:09.145
So I'd like us to be a little bit more careful in the use

3466
03:10:09.145 --> 03:10:10.865
of words and terminology around students

3467
03:10:10.885 --> 03:10:12.105
and how much we talk about it.

3468
03:10:12.565 --> 03:10:13.865
Um, I actually think

3469
03:10:13.865 --> 03:10:16.265
that most students just need mental health and support.

3470
03:10:16.775 --> 03:10:19.185
They don't be need to be reminded that this is an option.

3471
03:10:19.805 --> 03:10:21.505
So I appreciate what you're trying to do here,

3472
03:10:21.525 --> 03:10:23.785
but, um, I really feel that there has

3473
03:10:23.785 --> 03:10:25.265
to be a little bit more care given to

3474
03:10:25.265 --> 03:10:27.025
how much we talk about and advertise it.

3475
03:10:27.445 --> 03:10:28.905
Um, if you have data

3476
03:10:28.905 --> 03:10:30.145
and statistics that show

3477
03:10:30.255 --> 03:10:32.105
that having posters all over the place,

3478
03:10:32.135 --> 03:10:34.705
discussions in health class, constantly reminding students

3479
03:10:34.705 --> 03:10:37.025
and having it on their badge is a good way

3480
03:10:37.025 --> 03:10:38.665
to imprint the word suicide into their

3481
03:10:38.665 --> 03:10:40.825
brain and that it's healthy for them.

3482
03:10:40.825 --> 03:10:42.825
That's great. I do think we need helplines,

3483
03:10:43.405 --> 03:10:45.185
but I would ask that we be a little bit more thoughtful

3484
03:10:45.185 --> 03:10:46.185
and constantly reminding students

3485
03:10:46.185 --> 03:10:48.825
that this is an option. Thank you, but

3486
03:10:48.895 --> 03:10:50.065
This is ed code.

3487
03:10:50.205 --> 03:10:53.345
We have requirements from the state on ways

3488
03:10:53.405 --> 03:10:54.465
we need to do this.

3489
03:10:54.565 --> 03:10:57.665
And, and I would say I'm very much in the mental health

3490
03:10:57.755 --> 03:11:00.665
realm right now, and the,

3491
03:11:00.965 --> 03:11:03.025
the research has gone completely the other way

3492
03:11:03.055 --> 03:11:04.825
that the less we talk about it,

3493
03:11:04.845 --> 03:11:06.185
the more problematic it becomes.

3494
03:11:07.125 --> 03:11:10.465
Um, and I think the

3495
03:11:11.085 --> 03:11:13.985
way we've opened up conversations around mental health

3496
03:11:14.885 --> 03:11:19.345
and helping students to seek help, know

3497
03:11:19.345 --> 03:11:22.425
where help is, help their friends to speak up if they're

3498
03:11:23.135 --> 03:11:24.185
worried about their friends

3499
03:11:24.245 --> 03:11:27.385
and how they do that, I think is absolutely critical

3500
03:11:27.645 --> 03:11:31.505
and has shown, I think that the research has gone, you know,

3501
03:11:31.505 --> 03:11:33.985
since the start of my career, the research in terms of

3502
03:11:34.575 --> 03:11:35.585
what happens at high schools

3503
03:11:35.585 --> 03:11:38.105
after, you know, has gone very differently.

3504
03:11:38.205 --> 03:11:41.105
And I think there's a reason the state

3505
03:11:41.125 --> 03:11:42.665
has mandated some of these things.

3506
03:11:43.185 --> 03:11:45.985
I know our psychologists are very much involved in it.

3507
03:11:46.605 --> 03:11:49.985
Um, in my district I've been involved in it many times,

3508
03:11:50.125 --> 03:11:52.305
you know, many discussions and trainings for staff.

3509
03:11:52.325 --> 03:11:53.425
And I think it's there.

3510
03:11:53.425 --> 03:11:54.545
And I think one

3511
03:11:54.545 --> 03:11:57.265
of the things I think was really important here is helping

3512
03:11:57.395 --> 03:11:59.785
staff to understand their role

3513
03:11:59.925 --> 03:12:01.665
and work within their specialty

3514
03:12:01.665 --> 03:12:03.585
that basically stay in your lane.

3515
03:12:03.615 --> 03:12:05.735
Like, you know, you need to be aware,

3516
03:12:05.795 --> 03:12:09.135
but you need to also reach out to the school psychologist,

3517
03:12:09.135 --> 03:12:10.215
the counselor, the mental health

3518
03:12:10.215 --> 03:12:12.055
professionals if you're concerned.

3519
03:12:12.075 --> 03:12:15.855
And so I think, um, I would absolutely

3520
03:12:17.545 --> 03:12:18.625
disagree with your comment there.

3521
03:12:19.285 --> 03:12:22.985
Um, and I think the, the recent research in mental health

3522
03:12:23.525 --> 03:12:27.465
is supporting that we are having these conversations we're

3523
03:12:28.445 --> 03:12:30.195
being open, um,

3524
03:12:31.295 --> 03:12:34.195
to help students support them as much as they can.

3525
03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:41.145
This is the first reading again.

3526
03:12:41.145 --> 03:12:44.075
So we are not voting on this one until next time. Correct?

3527
03:12:44.745 --> 03:12:49.175
Correct. All righty, thank you. Now we're going on to hr.

3528
03:12:49.555 --> 03:12:52.465
So I see Heather has quite a few HR

3529
03:12:52.465 --> 03:12:55.125
ones starting with

3530
03:13:01.615 --> 03:13:04.845
Thank you and good evening again, the first time

3531
03:13:04.845 --> 03:13:06.205
that we're bringing forward to you.

3532
03:13:06.225 --> 03:13:09.325
As you can see, there's a number of them, um, is related

3533
03:13:09.505 --> 03:13:12.805
to updates and policy related to discipline, suspension

3534
03:13:12.805 --> 03:13:14.245
and disciplinary action.

3535
03:13:15.305 --> 03:13:17.845
Um, I think the most important aspect

3536
03:13:17.845 --> 03:13:19.205
of the revisions being forward,

3537
03:13:19.305 --> 03:13:20.765
as you can see in the board background,

3538
03:13:21.345 --> 03:13:24.125
is just some expanded language around making sure

3539
03:13:24.195 --> 03:13:25.805
that we have details included

3540
03:13:25.805 --> 03:13:28.125
around protected union union activities

3541
03:13:28.505 --> 03:13:29.885
and how that may overlay

3542
03:13:30.155 --> 03:13:31.965
with potentially disciplining someone

3543
03:13:31.965 --> 03:13:34.045
because they're engaging in those activities.

3544
03:13:34.865 --> 03:13:37.965
But I'm, I'd love to answer any questions you have about the

3545
03:13:38.125 --> 03:13:39.325
revisions that we're bringing forward

3546
03:13:39.325 --> 03:13:40.445
tonight, if you have any.

3547
03:13:44.335 --> 03:13:45.915
So just a reminder, uh,

3548
03:13:46.175 --> 03:13:50.155
and clarification, um, Ms. Campos that this is straight, uh,

3549
03:13:50.555 --> 03:13:53.715
CSBA updated languages is not unique to Dublin.

3550
03:13:53.855 --> 03:13:56.115
We have not added language that pertains

3551
03:13:56.115 --> 03:13:57.195
to just Dublin Unified.

3552
03:13:57.335 --> 03:13:58.675
That's precisely accurate

3553
03:13:58.695 --> 03:14:00.075
and will be the same for each

3554
03:14:00.075 --> 03:14:01.955
of the items I'm bringing forward tonight. Thank you.

3555
03:14:02.055 --> 03:14:04.075
And these are, there's two different ones

3556
03:14:04.075 --> 03:14:05.635
because they're two, is it like classified

3557
03:14:05.635 --> 03:14:08.675
and certificated, like 42 and 41? Is it,

3558
03:14:08.675 --> 03:14:10.555
Uh, the 4,100 is always,

3559
03:14:10.575 --> 03:14:13.155
the 100 series will always be for certificated.

3560
03:14:13.935 --> 03:14:16.355
And the 40, 4200

3561
03:14:16.355 --> 03:14:17.635
Is 200 is classified.

3562
03:14:17.635 --> 03:14:19.915
Classified. Um, yes, that's accurate related

3563
03:14:19.935 --> 03:14:21.235
to this, just those two groups.

3564
03:14:21.665 --> 03:14:24.115
Okay. Thank you. Mm-Hmm. Any questions?

3565
03:14:24.115 --> 03:14:26.135
That seemed pretty straightforward.

3566
03:14:31.375 --> 03:14:35.605
All right, we'll go to the next one, which is leaves. Yes.

3567
03:14:36.425 --> 03:14:41.165
Um, the second item related to leaves does apply

3568
03:14:41.185 --> 03:14:44.685
to classified certificated and, uh, leadership employees,

3569
03:14:44.685 --> 03:14:46.605
or I should say certificated classified

3570
03:14:46.745 --> 03:14:48.445
and leadership employees.

3571
03:14:49.065 --> 03:14:51.805
And again, um, just include some revisions

3572
03:14:51.805 --> 03:14:53.605
to update some language, particularly

3573
03:14:53.905 --> 03:14:56.845
as I've written in the background about placing

3574
03:14:57.445 --> 03:14:58.965
employees on involuntary leave.

3575
03:14:59.625 --> 03:15:03.285
It specifically, um, uh, discusses

3576
03:15:03.285 --> 03:15:04.805
and expands upon whether

3577
03:15:04.945 --> 03:15:06.685
or not when you're in the process

3578
03:15:06.745 --> 03:15:10.165
of considering placing someone on an unpaid leave

3579
03:15:10.635 --> 03:15:11.845
that is involuntary

3580
03:15:12.345 --> 03:15:15.885
and we determine at the end of the investigation, um,

3581
03:15:16.195 --> 03:15:19.485
that it weighs in the employee's favor, that they, they are

3582
03:15:19.485 --> 03:15:20.925
to be made whole at the end of

3583
03:15:20.925 --> 03:15:22.845
that leave if they lost any compensation.

3584
03:15:23.725 --> 03:15:26.685
I think it makes sense, but any questions that I can answer,

3585
03:15:26.685 --> 03:15:27.925
please let me know

3586
03:15:37.305 --> 03:15:38.305
Any questions.

3587
03:15:38.785 --> 03:15:41.445
And most of this refers just back to our CBAs.

3588
03:15:42.335 --> 03:15:43.475
It does. And, um,

3589
03:15:43.575 --> 03:15:46.195
and you can also see in the language that's added,

3590
03:15:46.435 --> 03:15:47.595
'cause there is quite a bit of language,

3591
03:15:47.695 --> 03:15:50.045
it really just expands upon a policy that

3592
03:15:50.045 --> 03:15:51.885
before was a bit brief, um,

3593
03:15:51.945 --> 03:15:54.285
and adds language that isn't really unique

3594
03:15:54.385 --> 03:15:58.045
or new just to explain to you all the types of leaves that,

3595
03:15:58.105 --> 03:15:59.325
um, employees may have.

3596
03:15:59.745 --> 03:16:01.565
But I think the most significant part is

3597
03:16:01.565 --> 03:16:02.805
what I referenced a moment ago.

3598
03:16:03.405 --> 03:16:05.695
Alright. You have any questions on that?

3599
03:16:10.085 --> 03:16:14.765
Okay, next one is temporary and substitute personnel.

3600
03:16:14.995 --> 03:16:17.685
Yeah. Now related to this item, these are, um,

3601
03:16:17.755 --> 03:16:18.885
this is a new bp.

3602
03:16:18.885 --> 03:16:20.445
There was an AR in place before

3603
03:16:20.465 --> 03:16:21.725
and there are revisions to it.

3604
03:16:22.065 --> 03:16:25.645
So with the bp, um, that you'll see, this is a brand new bp,

3605
03:16:25.745 --> 03:16:28.525
it just really aligns with the revisions to the AR

3606
03:16:29.025 --> 03:16:30.365
and provides a lot of clarity

3607
03:16:30.465 --> 03:16:33.645
and detail around how you can classify a temporary

3608
03:16:33.665 --> 03:16:34.885
or substitute employee.

3609
03:16:35.225 --> 03:16:38.005
And this is just related to certificated employees.

3610
03:16:39.365 --> 03:16:42.025
And, um, if I can answer any questions

3611
03:16:42.025 --> 03:16:43.145
for you, please let me know.

3612
03:16:43.205 --> 03:16:44.385
But I do wanna highlight

3613
03:16:44.735 --> 03:16:47.545
that we did have an AR in place in the past,

3614
03:16:48.995 --> 03:16:52.535
and if you look at the regulation, um, there are,

3615
03:16:52.625 --> 03:16:55.335
there is quite a bit of, of language that's stricken,

3616
03:16:55.595 --> 03:16:58.335
but it's just making sure that we're compliant with language

3617
03:16:58.335 --> 03:17:01.135
that relates to ed co primarily around ED code,

3618
03:17:01.435 --> 03:17:03.255
but not significantly new for the way

3619
03:17:03.255 --> 03:17:05.255
that we implement our temporary employment

3620
03:17:11.835 --> 03:17:13.815
and substitute employment, I should say.

3621
03:17:13.925 --> 03:17:14.925
Yeah.

3622
03:17:16.505 --> 03:17:18.475
Very important subs. Yes,

3623
03:17:18.765 --> 03:17:20.275
Definitely we need those folks.

3624
03:17:21.825 --> 03:17:23.845
Any questions related to this one?

3625
03:17:24.595 --> 03:17:27.805
Again, fairly straightforward. Okay.

3626
03:17:28.025 --> 03:17:29.325
I'm gonna keep going. Okay.

3627
03:17:29.905 --> 03:17:33.005
Um, item number four is related to classified

3628
03:17:33.025 --> 03:17:35.765
or certificate classified and leadership employees.

3629
03:17:36.205 --> 03:17:39.045
I think the importance around the revision in these bps is

3630
03:17:39.045 --> 03:17:40.565
primarily around the fact that,

3631
03:17:40.585 --> 03:17:42.965
and you're seeing this language sort of updated

3632
03:17:42.985 --> 03:17:44.485
and laid into policies, um,

3633
03:17:44.485 --> 03:17:48.765
across the board is really an expansion of clarifying, um,

3634
03:17:48.795 --> 03:17:52.165
protections and rights for employees, um,

3635
03:17:52.585 --> 03:17:54.125
around their protected status.

3636
03:17:54.705 --> 03:17:58.765
And so you've been seeing these, um, updates kind of coming

3637
03:17:58.765 --> 03:18:01.525
through in various, particularly related to HR policies.

3638
03:18:01.895 --> 03:18:05.325
Again, I wanna clarify that the protections around, um,

3639
03:18:05.435 --> 03:18:08.245
members and their rights to be in protected status

3640
03:18:08.425 --> 03:18:11.685
for speaking up on behalf of various, um, needs

3641
03:18:11.685 --> 03:18:13.365
that they have or things that come forward.

3642
03:18:13.795 --> 03:18:16.245
It's not necessarily that the laws are are changing.

3643
03:18:16.565 --> 03:18:19.525
I really wanna say that I think CSBA, in my opinion,

3644
03:18:19.625 --> 03:18:22.485
is doing a nice job of updating, um, policies

3645
03:18:22.485 --> 03:18:24.125
to be a bit more explanatory.

3646
03:18:24.865 --> 03:18:28.285
Um, and this one in particular, you'll see expansions

3647
03:18:28.285 --> 03:18:30.645
around explaining protected rights

3648
03:18:30.645 --> 03:18:33.765
around whistle whistleblower and bringing things forward.

3649
03:18:34.385 --> 03:18:37.045
Um, and the fact that we can't discipline you

3650
03:18:37.225 --> 03:18:38.885
or retaliate against you in any way

3651
03:18:38.885 --> 03:18:39.885
for bringing issues forward.

3652
03:18:42.645 --> 03:18:45.545
And there's one policy, um, revision for each group.

3653
03:18:46.295 --> 03:18:48.165
Okay. Trustee Blackman, I,

3654
03:18:48.165 --> 03:18:49.525
so I wanna ask you questions about

3655
03:18:49.525 --> 03:18:50.685
the whistleblower protection.

3656
03:18:50.685 --> 03:18:53.445
Mm-Hmm. Um, my understanding is that this is specific,

3657
03:18:53.665 --> 03:18:55.365
the way it's written, it looks like it's only specific

3658
03:18:55.365 --> 03:18:57.045
to state or federal rules and regulations.

3659
03:18:57.145 --> 03:19:01.985
Is that true? Or is it,

3660
03:19:02.365 --> 03:19:03.505
do you I'm looking at

3661
03:19:03.505 --> 03:19:05.305
Thinking that, yeah. Would you, sorry,

3662
03:19:05.305 --> 03:19:06.305
Let me read the number. Um,

3663
03:19:06.305 --> 03:19:08.545
4 1 1 9 0.1.

3664
03:19:09.825 --> 03:19:11.425
I was actually trying to look at all of them.

3665
03:19:11.685 --> 03:19:14.065
Um, that was the AR mm-Hmm.

3666
03:19:14.745 --> 03:19:18.305
I think, no, that was the policy. 4 1 1 9 1 mm-Hmm.

3667
03:19:18.845 --> 03:19:21.225
Um, has a description.

3668
03:19:21.225 --> 03:19:23.945
It's very similar to the one in, um, the others. Yes.

3669
03:19:24.245 --> 03:19:27.185
And the, the question I just wanna ask is that the writing

3670
03:19:27.795 --> 03:19:30.345
seems to apply that whistleblower protection only applies

3671
03:19:30.535 --> 03:19:33.985
when the employee is calling out something with related

3672
03:19:34.005 --> 03:19:35.305
to either state or federal.

3673
03:19:35.565 --> 03:19:37.625
Oh, I see. Rule or regulation, yes.

3674
03:19:38.085 --> 03:19:40.345
But only those, so in other words, an employee

3675
03:19:40.345 --> 03:19:42.185
that calls out something that is a violation

3676
03:19:42.185 --> 03:19:43.825
of anything else does not have

3677
03:19:43.825 --> 03:19:46.375
whistleblower protection action. Hmm.

3678
03:19:47.015 --> 03:19:48.775
I think that's interesting. Can I look into

3679
03:19:48.775 --> 03:19:50.855
that a little bit and certainly consider

3680
03:19:50.855 --> 03:19:52.655
that in the second reading, please.

3681
03:19:52.895 --> 03:19:56.855
I, I, I do wanna say, um, I, I can't speak to

3682
03:19:56.855 --> 03:19:57.975
that specifically right now

3683
03:19:57.975 --> 03:19:59.735
and would like to think about that a little bit more,

3684
03:19:59.735 --> 03:20:01.775
particularly in relation to what the ED code says.

3685
03:20:02.085 --> 03:20:05.775
However, um, and I know this has been said before,

3686
03:20:05.795 --> 03:20:07.015
but it's important to note

3687
03:20:07.015 --> 03:20:09.815
that anytime somebody brings forward something

3688
03:20:09.815 --> 03:20:11.055
that they think is being hidden

3689
03:20:11.155 --> 03:20:13.015
or needs to be daylighted, um,

3690
03:20:13.045 --> 03:20:15.055
prompts our need to investigate.

3691
03:20:15.315 --> 03:20:16.815
So there are a number of policies

3692
03:20:16.815 --> 03:20:18.855
and regulations that prompt that type of work,

3693
03:20:19.195 --> 03:20:22.055
but if you don't mind, I'll look into it just a little bit

3694
03:20:22.055 --> 03:20:24.855
more and be prepared to answer that question later.

3695
03:20:36.125 --> 03:20:37.465
Any other questions on that item?

3696
03:20:41.765 --> 03:20:45.895
Okay. The next item, um, J five is related to probationary

3697
03:20:45.895 --> 03:20:46.895
and permanent status.

3698
03:20:47.265 --> 03:20:48.575
Again, these are revisions.

3699
03:20:48.755 --> 03:20:51.615
Um, I do wanna say there's nothing significant in the

3700
03:20:51.895 --> 03:20:53.695
revisions that overlays with

3701
03:20:53.895 --> 03:20:55.535
what we actually do in practice.

3702
03:20:55.935 --> 03:20:58.735
I think the most important part if you look at, um,

3703
03:20:58.825 --> 03:21:01.135
where it's being added is again,

3704
03:21:01.135 --> 03:21:03.935
it's just really laying in some more detail for folks

3705
03:21:03.995 --> 03:21:06.895
to understand how it is that we can classify you

3706
03:21:06.895 --> 03:21:09.655
as probationary and how you move to permanent status.

3707
03:21:10.235 --> 03:21:13.735
And these policies only relate to, um, certificated

3708
03:21:13.795 --> 03:21:15.015
and classified employees.

3709
03:21:15.355 --> 03:21:17.535
So the difference between certificated

3710
03:21:17.535 --> 03:21:20.815
and classified as clearly delineated in there, classified

3711
03:21:20.995 --> 03:21:23.895
as six months or 130 work days with a teacher

3712
03:21:23.995 --> 03:21:25.935
or certificated, it's entirely different.

3713
03:21:25.935 --> 03:21:26.895
They go through temporary

3714
03:21:26.895 --> 03:21:28.335
probationary and then to permanent.

3715
03:21:28.675 --> 03:21:31.135
And that's all really well explained in here,

3716
03:21:31.155 --> 03:21:33.255
but is absolutely what we do in practice

3717
03:21:33.255 --> 03:21:34.495
and have done for many years.

3718
03:21:38.175 --> 03:21:40.155
Can I answer any questions about those items?

3719
03:21:44.365 --> 03:21:46.065
Okay. I'm gonna move to J six.

3720
03:21:46.605 --> 03:21:49.585
Um, the next item relates to dress and grooming.

3721
03:21:49.585 --> 03:21:51.985
And there is a policy for all of our employee groups.

3722
03:21:52.765 --> 03:21:56.505
And, um, the most important piece about this, um,

3723
03:21:57.295 --> 03:21:59.505
related to this is it is a revision.

3724
03:21:59.925 --> 03:22:01.345
And you can see that it,

3725
03:22:01.375 --> 03:22:05.025
it's just adding in some more language around ensuring

3726
03:22:05.295 --> 03:22:08.865
that we understand that we need to allow employees

3727
03:22:08.865 --> 03:22:11.345
to dress in a manner that's consistent with their identity

3728
03:22:11.405 --> 03:22:12.545
or gender expression,

3729
03:22:12.965 --> 03:22:15.465
and that we can't, um, discriminate against them

3730
03:22:16.085 --> 03:22:17.185
for doing so.

3731
03:22:17.405 --> 03:22:20.705
It also expands on adding language around hairstyle.

3732
03:22:21.445 --> 03:22:25.385
And, um, of course it can't, there cannot be any, um,

3733
03:22:26.485 --> 03:22:28.065
uh, loss of compensation

3734
03:22:28.085 --> 03:22:30.705
or discipline related to the way that you choose

3735
03:22:30.705 --> 03:22:32.745
to express yourself and dress in grooming.

3736
03:22:33.325 --> 03:22:35.065
And there's a policy for each of the groups.

3737
03:22:35.535 --> 03:22:36.705
It's very short. Um,

3738
03:22:36.845 --> 03:22:38.945
but the extra language I think is very helpful.

3739
03:22:42.465 --> 03:22:46.915
Trustee Blackman, so I understand that this, the

3740
03:22:47.555 --> 03:22:49.715
revisions were basically based on some of these

3741
03:22:50.235 --> 03:22:52.475
identity needs that in new protected classes,

3742
03:22:52.565 --> 03:22:54.915
which I understand and that's necessary,

3743
03:22:55.295 --> 03:22:56.795
but there's so little in here

3744
03:22:57.305 --> 03:22:59.195
that honestly, I'll give you an example.

3745
03:22:59.435 --> 03:23:02.235
A teacher who's teaching about a, a country that has

3746
03:23:02.775 --> 03:23:05.635
an island nation and decides to wear what

3747
03:23:05.635 --> 03:23:06.675
that island nation wears,

3748
03:23:06.675 --> 03:23:09.035
which might just be a grass skirt and a bikini top.

3749
03:23:09.915 --> 03:23:12.335
It could be a guy from like some island nation,

3750
03:23:12.335 --> 03:23:13.695
and they just decide to wear that.

3751
03:23:13.695 --> 03:23:14.975
There's nothing in our policy

3752
03:23:14.975 --> 03:23:16.255
that prevents them from wearing that

3753
03:23:16.255 --> 03:23:18.775
because we state appropriate, they could argue

3754
03:23:18.775 --> 03:23:20.535
that's appropriate to what I'm teaching that day.

3755
03:23:21.615 --> 03:23:25.075
So there's also nothing in here about safety in terms

3756
03:23:25.075 --> 03:23:26.995
of wearing like, the sorts of things

3757
03:23:26.995 --> 03:23:30.115
that we would wanna protect and inform our staff.

3758
03:23:30.295 --> 03:23:31.995
If you're working on a site, for example,

3759
03:23:32.055 --> 03:23:33.355
or a maintenance department, I would hope

3760
03:23:33.355 --> 03:23:34.275
that you'd have boots with like

3761
03:23:34.275 --> 03:23:35.395
steel plates and bomb of them.

3762
03:23:35.395 --> 03:23:37.555
Mm-Hmm. If they, if we don't tell them

3763
03:23:37.615 --> 03:23:40.315
and they get a nail in their foot, who's, who's that on?

3764
03:23:40.315 --> 03:23:41.315
That's a liability for us.

3765
03:23:41.335 --> 03:23:44.235
So these are very vague and open-ended.

3766
03:23:44.275 --> 03:23:45.675
I actually think there's a lot of liability

3767
03:23:45.735 --> 03:23:47.555
by not providing specifics, especially

3768
03:23:47.555 --> 03:23:48.715
around the issues of safety.

3769
03:23:49.505 --> 03:23:50.795
When you say appropriate dress,

3770
03:23:50.915 --> 03:23:52.035
I think everybody in their mind has

3771
03:23:52.035 --> 03:23:53.075
a different idea about what that means.

3772
03:23:53.735 --> 03:23:57.415
So unfortunately, you leave it up to a supervisor to define

3773
03:23:57.415 --> 03:23:59.935
that and that supervisor could be held for a bias

3774
03:24:00.395 --> 03:24:02.695
for whatever reason, because we didn't define what it is

3775
03:24:02.695 --> 03:24:03.775
that is appropriate.

3776
03:24:04.305 --> 03:24:06.015
Again, I don't see this as being helpful.

3777
03:24:06.905 --> 03:24:09.805
So I would hope that we, if we're gonna be so specific as

3778
03:24:09.805 --> 03:24:13.655
to denote hairstyles, we should be specific enough to define

3779
03:24:13.765 --> 03:24:15.255
what appropriate dress is

3780
03:24:15.275 --> 03:24:17.135
for our staff in certain circumstances,

3781
03:24:17.225 --> 03:24:19.455
especially when safety's a concern.

3782
03:24:19.455 --> 03:24:23.175
Mm-Hmm. And I'm, my references are primarily for individuals

3783
03:24:23.175 --> 03:24:24.655
who are working with machines.

3784
03:24:24.675 --> 03:24:27.375
And again, those working in labs, we have nothing in here.

3785
03:24:27.435 --> 03:24:28.775
And I'm very concerned for the safety

3786
03:24:28.775 --> 03:24:30.255
of our staff without providing that information.

3787
03:24:30.275 --> 03:24:32.415
Mm-Hmm. You can write a paragraph that says that can be,

3788
03:24:32.595 --> 03:24:34.655
you know, developed by the supervisor,

3789
03:24:34.655 --> 03:24:35.815
but there needs to be something in here.

3790
03:24:36.705 --> 03:24:37.895
Thank you for bringing that up.

3791
03:24:38.095 --> 03:24:41.095
I, I feel that the first paragraph covers that adequately.

3792
03:24:41.475 --> 03:24:43.015
It talks about the fact that, um,

3793
03:24:43.145 --> 03:24:45.725
and I think you're referring more to what professional dress

3794
03:24:45.725 --> 03:24:47.085
and grooming would be considered.

3795
03:24:47.545 --> 03:24:49.885
Um, in particular it does talk about the safety.

3796
03:24:50.325 --> 03:24:52.965
I think the most important part of that first paragraph is

3797
03:24:52.965 --> 03:24:55.245
that all employees shall be held to the same standards.

3798
03:24:55.745 --> 03:24:59.205
So same standards would not necessarily mean that a um,

3799
03:24:59.745 --> 03:25:01.325
person working in maintenance

3800
03:25:01.365 --> 03:25:04.565
and operation who needs to wear strong, closed toed shoes

3801
03:25:04.635 --> 03:25:06.005
with maybe a steel toe

3802
03:25:06.005 --> 03:25:09.005
or something is gonna be the same as what we might consider

3803
03:25:09.145 --> 03:25:11.685
for someone working in a special education

3804
03:25:12.465 --> 03:25:14.805
IA position in a classroom where kids might move

3805
03:25:14.805 --> 03:25:16.645
around a lot and shouldn't be wearing flip flops.

3806
03:25:17.025 --> 03:25:20.605
But I think the consistency is around making sure

3807
03:25:20.605 --> 03:25:22.765
that if we expect that of one E-S-N-I-A,

3808
03:25:22.785 --> 03:25:23.965
we expect it of everybody.

3809
03:25:24.625 --> 03:25:28.205
Um, and I do think that, um, we don't have evidence

3810
03:25:28.205 --> 03:25:30.765
that suggests that our managers are sort

3811
03:25:30.765 --> 03:25:32.685
of inconsistently applying a standard

3812
03:25:32.745 --> 03:25:35.005
to employee address in regard to dress

3813
03:25:35.005 --> 03:25:36.285
and grooming for employees.

3814
03:25:36.345 --> 03:25:39.085
It would be very common for a manager to call HR

3815
03:25:39.105 --> 03:25:41.965
and consult with us if they felt they had a concern about

3816
03:25:41.965 --> 03:25:43.605
some, what somebody was wearing to work.

3817
03:25:44.105 --> 03:25:45.765
Um, and it doesn't happen that often,

3818
03:25:45.865 --> 03:25:47.325
but occasionally folks will call.

3819
03:25:47.705 --> 03:25:50.685
So I think, um, our managers are pretty attentive

3820
03:25:50.825 --> 03:25:52.365
to being respectful about checking

3821
03:25:52.465 --> 03:25:53.645
in before they make a judgment

3822
03:25:54.595 --> 03:25:58.365
When it comes to our trades and our grounds crew.

3823
03:25:58.545 --> 03:26:01.045
Do we not have specific language in the job description?

3824
03:26:01.515 --> 03:26:03.045
Yeah, I, I appreciate you asking.

3825
03:26:03.325 --> 03:26:05.445
I think we, I would have to look and I'll do that

3826
03:26:05.445 --> 03:26:08.805
before I come back, but we do have a district uniform policy

3827
03:26:08.865 --> 03:26:10.005
that's slightly different,

3828
03:26:10.345 --> 03:26:12.285
but talks about uniforms that we provide.

3829
03:26:12.485 --> 03:26:14.045
I don't know that I would say it's specific

3830
03:26:14.065 --> 03:26:15.525
to like the footwear and,

3831
03:26:15.825 --> 03:26:17.965
and you know, making sure that we address that,

3832
03:26:18.025 --> 03:26:19.565
but it partially covers it.

3833
03:26:19.815 --> 03:26:21.205
Lemme take a look at that though,

3834
03:26:21.665 --> 03:26:22.925
and I'll be prepared to answer

3835
03:26:22.955 --> 03:26:24.045
when I come back for a second.

3836
03:26:24.045 --> 03:26:25.045
Reading

3837
03:26:26.255 --> 03:26:29.255
Trustee equal, Um, in regards to the,

3838
03:26:30.745 --> 03:26:33.845
the dress code when it comes to different trade groups

3839
03:26:34.865 --> 03:26:36.965
and for example, nurses

3840
03:26:37.225 --> 03:26:40.245
or folks working, um, in facilities,

3841
03:26:40.435 --> 03:26:41.725
doesn't OSHA cover that?

3842
03:26:41.875 --> 03:26:43.645
Like in terms of like what you should be wearing?

3843
03:26:43.995 --> 03:26:45.485
Yeah. Thank you for asking that.

3844
03:26:45.505 --> 03:26:48.165
We do have other board policies and regulations

3845
03:26:48.225 --> 03:26:50.565
and contract language that relates to making sure

3846
03:26:50.565 --> 03:26:51.565
that we provide people

3847
03:26:51.565 --> 03:26:53.325
with the supplies they need to be safe.

3848
03:26:53.945 --> 03:26:56.965
So in regards to you referenced the district nurses,

3849
03:26:57.305 --> 03:27:01.285
we have, um, an IAPP or an injury illness

3850
03:27:01.385 --> 03:27:04.325
and prevention plan that details some of those things.

3851
03:27:04.705 --> 03:27:07.045
So I'll make sure that I put some bullet points together

3852
03:27:07.105 --> 03:27:08.205
to share with you next time.

3853
03:27:08.645 --> 03:27:10.725
'cause I don't think that everything that relates

3854
03:27:10.745 --> 03:27:13.365
to ensuring that our employees are safe in terms of

3855
03:27:13.365 --> 03:27:17.125
what they wear or put on themselves at work is just related

3856
03:27:17.145 --> 03:27:18.565
to our dress and grooming policy.

3857
03:27:19.955 --> 03:27:22.795
I, um, at tendencies is more of a over

3858
03:27:24.975 --> 03:27:28.025
overarching, uh, umbrella to cover some of the new issues

3859
03:27:28.025 --> 03:27:29.025
that were brought up in terms

3860
03:27:29.025 --> 03:27:30.865
of discrimination and, and whatnot.

3861
03:27:31.045 --> 03:27:33.785
So I I don't see that we need to go into the details

3862
03:27:33.815 --> 03:27:36.945
that was, that was mentioned for this policy.

3863
03:27:37.125 --> 03:27:39.025
Do you mean in relation to the student policy?

3864
03:27:39.605 --> 03:27:41.685
No. Oh, okay. This is just for, for adults.

3865
03:27:41.855 --> 03:27:43.365
We're talking about adult dress code, right?

3866
03:27:43.365 --> 03:27:46.315
Yeah, I mean, I like the way it is written

3867
03:27:46.455 --> 03:27:47.875
as it is based on ed code,

3868
03:27:47.875 --> 03:27:49.235
because I don't think this is here

3869
03:27:49.255 --> 03:27:51.435
to address every single little detail of

3870
03:27:51.435 --> 03:27:52.995
how a person should dress based on

3871
03:27:52.995 --> 03:27:54.715
Their, I think that's safe and fair to say Yes.

3872
03:27:54.825 --> 03:27:56.795
Okay. But I'll make sure I can

3873
03:27:56.795 --> 03:27:58.275
answer a couple of those questions.

3874
03:28:01.545 --> 03:28:05.855
All right. Um, item seven is also an,

3875
03:28:06.055 --> 03:28:09.615
a new board policy to attach to a revision of a, of a,

3876
03:28:10.985 --> 03:28:13.525
um, administrative regulation that we already had in place.

3877
03:28:14.145 --> 03:28:16.565
And it's just related to certificated employment

3878
03:28:16.825 --> 03:28:19.365
and the hiring of interns.

3879
03:28:19.985 --> 03:28:22.365
Um, and as you know, um, more

3880
03:28:22.365 --> 03:28:25.405
and more we are on occasionally hiring interns in school

3881
03:28:25.645 --> 03:28:27.325
districts when positions are hard to fill,

3882
03:28:27.585 --> 03:28:29.805
or we wanna support one of our employees that's working

3883
03:28:29.825 --> 03:28:30.885
to get their credential.

3884
03:28:31.345 --> 03:28:34.525
So the board pol the, the board policy

3885
03:28:35.065 --> 03:28:37.765
and regulation really expand on

3886
03:28:37.825 --> 03:28:41.445
and make it very clear how, how do we hire them?

3887
03:28:41.755 --> 03:28:44.045
What type of support do we need to provide them,

3888
03:28:44.465 --> 03:28:45.965
and how do we go about ensuring

3889
03:28:45.995 --> 03:28:47.565
that they get all of those things?

3890
03:28:48.105 --> 03:28:50.165
Um, and what type of agreement do we need

3891
03:28:50.165 --> 03:28:51.405
to reach with the university?

3892
03:28:52.145 --> 03:28:54.045
And if you have any questions, let me know.

3893
03:28:54.305 --> 03:28:56.165
Um, however, these are all things

3894
03:28:56.165 --> 03:28:57.525
that we've been doing for a while.

3895
03:28:57.525 --> 03:28:59.845
We do follow the procedures as outlined.

3896
03:29:08.165 --> 03:29:09.055
Okay. That's

3897
03:29:09.255 --> 03:29:11.255
Anything, right? Oh, oh, excuse me.

3898
03:29:11.735 --> 03:29:13.255
Thank You. I'm sorry, I just thought it was this.

3899
03:29:13.435 --> 03:29:15.535
Uh, this is college level interns, right?

3900
03:29:15.535 --> 03:29:16.695
We're not talking about high school

3901
03:29:16.765 --> 03:29:18.135
interns who wants to do a summer,

3902
03:29:18.585 --> 03:29:19.585
Right? We're talking about, we're

3903
03:29:19.585 --> 03:29:21.055
talking about teaching interns.

3904
03:29:21.475 --> 03:29:24.255
So they're on an intern credential program while we support

3905
03:29:24.255 --> 03:29:25.375
them earning their credential.

3906
03:29:25.685 --> 03:29:26.775
Okay. Thanks. Yeah.

3907
03:29:26.775 --> 03:29:28.895
Yeah. Thank you for asking. Right.

3908
03:29:28.915 --> 03:29:32.895
The last item, um, is related to revisions around health

3909
03:29:32.895 --> 03:29:33.975
and welfare benefits,

3910
03:29:34.355 --> 03:29:36.615
and does address, um, all of our groups.

3911
03:29:37.485 --> 03:29:42.285
And, um, it, it is just an expansion, I believe,

3912
03:29:42.385 --> 03:29:44.565
of ensuring that we're following the law.

3913
03:29:44.985 --> 03:29:47.125
Um, there are a couple of new pieces in there.

3914
03:29:47.545 --> 03:29:51.965
One in particular talks about ensuring that, um, the rates

3915
03:29:52.075 --> 03:29:56.605
that we have are appropriately percentaged out to the type

3916
03:29:56.705 --> 03:29:58.565
to the amount that you're making annually.

3917
03:29:59.225 --> 03:30:02.605
Um, I was looking over these as these were developing them,

3918
03:30:02.665 --> 03:30:04.325
and when I bring them for second reading,

3919
03:30:04.465 --> 03:30:05.485
I'm just gonna do some double

3920
03:30:05.645 --> 03:30:06.765
checking on numbers with Chris.

3921
03:30:07.185 --> 03:30:08.925
But I've been looking at all the numbers

3922
03:30:09.025 --> 03:30:11.165
and I believe we're compliant in every single way.

3923
03:30:11.465 --> 03:30:14.285
But I'm gonna check with my good colleague Chris Hobbs

3924
03:30:14.285 --> 03:30:15.365
before we bring the second reading

3925
03:30:15.385 --> 03:30:16.965
and make sure we haven't missed anything.

3926
03:30:17.625 --> 03:30:20.885
Um, but I believe everything is compliant in the policies

3927
03:30:20.885 --> 03:30:22.405
that we're bringing forward to you tonight.

3928
03:30:26.315 --> 03:30:27.365
Trustee Blackman,

3929
03:30:28.905 --> 03:30:30.075
Just catching one thing.

3930
03:30:30.115 --> 03:30:35.035
I I, it looks like it's actually written into family code.

3931
03:30:35.295 --> 03:30:36.875
Mm-Hmm. Maybe it's just not up to date,

3932
03:30:36.935 --> 03:30:39.725
but, um, in instances where you see the, the references

3933
03:30:39.825 --> 03:30:44.765
to his and her, please add, I guess it would be their, oh,

3934
03:30:45.475 --> 03:30:47.575
Do we have some, his and her language in here?

3935
03:30:47.635 --> 03:30:50.055
Yes. There's some language pieces in it, you point to

3936
03:30:50.055 --> 03:30:51.055
Make sure that you point me to one of them. Oh,

3937
03:30:51.055 --> 03:30:52.375
I see it. Okay. Yeah,

3938
03:30:52.485 --> 03:30:54.415
Just to make sure that it's not, you know,

3939
03:30:54.445 --> 03:30:56.375
this may be a little older out of date.

3940
03:30:56.375 --> 03:30:58.935
Yeah. Not up to speed, but if it has been updated, if,

3941
03:30:58.955 --> 03:31:00.135
if we can update, that'd be great. Thank,

3942
03:31:00.135 --> 03:31:01.135
Thank you. I will fix those,

3943
03:31:01.135 --> 03:31:02.575
um, gender references.

3944
03:31:09.105 --> 03:31:10.595
Okay. If there are no other questions.

3945
03:31:11.905 --> 03:31:13.005
All righty. See you next. Thank you, Heather.

3946
03:31:13.185 --> 03:31:15.545
You're welcome. Alrighty.

3947
03:31:15.965 --> 03:31:19.145
Um, that brings us to consent, which is fairly short.

3948
03:31:19.295 --> 03:31:21.025
It's KL and m.

3949
03:31:21.765 --> 03:31:24.585
Is there anything anyone wishes to pull from KL

3950
03:31:24.645 --> 03:31:26.465
or M Trustee Blackman?

3951
03:31:27.355 --> 03:31:29.535
Uh, K three. K five.

3952
03:31:34.635 --> 03:31:39.355
Anyone else? Okay.

3953
03:31:39.355 --> 03:31:41.755
Then I'll take a motion to approve everything else.

3954
03:31:42.945 --> 03:31:44.875
I'll move. We approve the consent calendar.

3955
03:31:45.255 --> 03:31:48.995
Um, KL and M minus K three. And K five

3956
03:31:51.195 --> 03:31:52.195
Second.

3957
03:31:52.675 --> 03:31:54.415
All right. We have a motion. Second. Any other motions?

3958
03:31:54.915 --> 03:31:59.685
Trustee Wanni? Aye. Everyone else? Aye. Aye. Aye, Carrie.

3959
03:32:00.425 --> 03:32:03.525
All right. Let's start with K three, which is

3960
03:32:04.105 --> 03:32:05.685
the proposition two.

3961
03:32:06.015 --> 03:32:08.165
Right. So I had mentioned the last meeting

3962
03:32:08.165 --> 03:32:12.085
that I had wanted to attend CSBA walkthrough of the, um,

3963
03:32:12.755 --> 03:32:16.205
proposition two and just provide a brief update.

3964
03:32:16.505 --> 03:32:20.565
Um, because of what I learned in the discussion, the, um,

3965
03:32:21.525 --> 03:32:23.445
apparently there's not a huge amount of support for it.

3966
03:32:24.025 --> 03:32:25.325
And that was what was relayed

3967
03:32:25.385 --> 03:32:28.525
by a former congressman who's actually taken over for CSB

3968
03:32:28.545 --> 03:32:29.565
and overseeing some of this.

3969
03:32:29.905 --> 03:32:31.085
He was leading the presentation.

3970
03:32:31.785 --> 03:32:33.685
Um, one of the things that he expresses

3971
03:32:33.685 --> 03:32:35.845
that it's a very confusing proposition,

3972
03:32:35.845 --> 03:32:38.205
the way it's written, he could not answer questions as

3973
03:32:38.205 --> 03:32:39.365
to whether or not in fact,

3974
03:32:39.475 --> 03:32:43.445
project 30 on the list will in fact be stay on the list

3975
03:32:43.445 --> 03:32:45.365
and the priorities that they are already in.

3976
03:32:46.545 --> 03:32:48.685
He was unable to answer questions

3977
03:32:48.685 --> 03:32:51.965
and provide guarantees that, um, new projects

3978
03:32:51.965 --> 03:32:54.205
that would be coming up, how they would be

3979
03:32:54.725 --> 03:32:56.325
determined in terms of the prioritization.

3980
03:32:56.705 --> 03:33:00.725
And, um, one of the questions that came up is

3981
03:33:00.725 --> 03:33:03.845
that there's these restrictions around projects

3982
03:33:03.845 --> 03:33:07.285
that you either have new facilities based on growth

3983
03:33:07.345 --> 03:33:09.925
or needs, or you have old facilities

3984
03:33:09.925 --> 03:33:12.725
that need modernization, that need to be 25 years or older.

3985
03:33:13.425 --> 03:33:15.645
So on some of our campuses, which are not 25 years

3986
03:33:15.645 --> 03:33:16.885
or older, we wouldn't qualify.

3987
03:33:18.025 --> 03:33:19.245
So that's a little bit of a problem.

3988
03:33:19.825 --> 03:33:23.005
Um, the concern that I have in

3989
03:33:23.065 --> 03:33:25.405
and some of the other questions that were asked

3990
03:33:25.465 --> 03:33:29.765
and the responses that were given, um, not a lot a a lot

3991
03:33:29.765 --> 03:33:31.285
of huge support, more questions.

3992
03:33:31.355 --> 03:33:34.125
Fremont, for example, was voice concerns about the largest

3993
03:33:34.265 --> 03:33:36.885
of their need with their new, um, facilities plan.

3994
03:33:37.665 --> 03:33:39.805
And the fact that there's no way that the size of this

3995
03:33:40.315 --> 03:33:42.525
proposition could possibly cover those costs.

3996
03:33:43.345 --> 03:33:45.045
The one thing I wanna daylight is that

3997
03:33:45.805 --> 03:33:50.095
this former assembly member expressed this is non new tax on

3998
03:33:50.255 --> 03:33:53.375
residents, but that is being carved out at the general fund.

3999
03:33:54.095 --> 03:33:55.155
The problem with that is

4000
03:33:55.395 --> 03:33:59.195
that right now school districts have a need for funding.

4001
03:33:59.935 --> 03:34:03.355
So although he says that the likelihood

4002
03:34:03.355 --> 03:34:06.555
of this rolling out quickly probably wouldn't happen is

4003
03:34:06.555 --> 03:34:09.795
that we're really dependent on there being enough money in

4004
03:34:09.795 --> 03:34:11.435
the general fund to allow for something like this.

4005
03:34:12.495 --> 03:34:16.105
My own personal concern is that school districts need money.

4006
03:34:16.325 --> 03:34:18.265
And if they're carving out money to pay for

4007
03:34:18.845 --> 03:34:21.105
an overall proposition that's worth like billions

4008
03:34:21.105 --> 03:34:22.705
of dollars, the money

4009
03:34:22.705 --> 03:34:25.625
that our district would normally receive just to pay

4010
03:34:25.625 --> 03:34:27.905
for costs that we're cutting right now would not happen.

4011
03:34:29.015 --> 03:34:33.615
It's all one pot. So if we're actually, if this moves ahead,

4012
03:34:33.795 --> 03:34:35.095
my concern is in the next two

4013
03:34:35.095 --> 03:34:36.695
or three years, maybe the next 10 years,

4014
03:34:37.275 --> 03:34:39.255
we will actually struggle to get monies

4015
03:34:39.255 --> 03:34:40.335
back into our district.

4016
03:34:40.335 --> 03:34:43.095
And many other districts that have, um, cuts in funding

4017
03:34:44.845 --> 03:34:47.705
the largest of the, um, proposition is likely

4018
03:34:47.805 --> 03:34:50.345
to last when they sell the bonds 30 to 40 years.

4019
03:34:50.485 --> 03:34:51.905
So this is something we're gonna be

4020
03:34:51.905 --> 03:34:53.065
paying for, for a very long time.

4021
03:34:54.045 --> 03:34:56.545
So I wasn't exactly thrilled by what I heard.

4022
03:34:57.295 --> 03:35:00.095
I felt that if we really needed money to do what we need

4023
03:35:00.095 --> 03:35:01.375
to do, we should do our own bond.

4024
03:35:01.775 --> 03:35:03.815
I don't think we'll be getting any new money from this.

4025
03:35:04.075 --> 03:35:05.575
We certainly don't qualify under some

4026
03:35:05.575 --> 03:35:06.735
of the equity components to it.

4027
03:35:07.395 --> 03:35:08.535
Um, and he wasn't able

4028
03:35:08.535 --> 03:35:11.935
to answer really specifically if we would actually fit in

4029
03:35:11.935 --> 03:35:14.055
the box, given that we have facilities

4030
03:35:14.055 --> 03:35:15.455
that are less than 25 years old

4031
03:35:15.455 --> 03:35:17.495
and not necessarily growth based in terms of need.

4032
03:35:17.595 --> 03:35:20.215
So I just, I provide you that information.

4033
03:35:20.285 --> 03:35:22.735
It's, um, a little disheartening.

4034
03:35:22.765 --> 03:35:24.735
They really do need the money at the state level,

4035
03:35:25.035 --> 03:35:27.975
but I actually think that this is one of the issues where

4036
03:35:28.675 --> 03:35:32.215
if it gets approved, it will actually affect school funding

4037
03:35:32.315 --> 03:35:33.535
for the next 10 years.

4038
03:35:33.835 --> 03:35:34.835
So, thanks.

4039
03:35:39.835 --> 03:35:41.315
I I'm just gonna say I'm in support.

4040
03:35:41.555 --> 03:35:43.755
I think you're never gonna get a

4041
03:35:43.755 --> 03:35:44.795
perfect thing at the state level.

4042
03:35:44.795 --> 03:35:46.235
There's so many different people

4043
03:35:46.535 --> 03:35:49.955
and different districts advocating for things.

4044
03:35:50.275 --> 03:35:53.355
I think we can very much show growth, um,

4045
03:35:53.575 --> 03:35:55.435
as why we were building new schools.

4046
03:35:56.175 --> 03:35:59.275
Um, and generally you wouldn't be modif,

4047
03:35:59.295 --> 03:36:00.875
you wouldn't be modernizing schools

4048
03:36:00.875 --> 03:36:01.915
that aren't 25 years old.

4049
03:36:01.935 --> 03:36:05.115
So I, I don't, I don't have a problem personally with that.

4050
03:36:05.755 --> 03:36:09.075
I think otherwise if we, I mean everyone has,

4051
03:36:09.135 --> 03:36:10.795
can do their own opinion on this one

4052
03:36:10.815 --> 03:36:12.355
and vote however you want on it.

4053
03:36:12.995 --> 03:36:15.595
I do think, um, this is the best chance we have

4054
03:36:15.595 --> 03:36:20.235
of getting reimbursement from the state for the many,

4055
03:36:20.265 --> 03:36:22.395
many millions of dollars we have spent to build Emerald

4056
03:36:23.065 --> 03:36:25.035
that we're gonna spend to build Shamrock Hills

4057
03:36:25.185 --> 03:36:28.275
that we've spent on facilities throughout the district.

4058
03:36:28.775 --> 03:36:30.275
Um, I think this is our best chance

4059
03:36:30.735 --> 03:36:33.195
and I will support this, um,

4060
03:36:33.195 --> 03:36:36.785
because I think nothing's perfect.

4061
03:36:36.785 --> 03:36:39.025
There's, there's so many factors going

4062
03:36:39.055 --> 03:36:40.225
into something across the state.

4063
03:36:41.085 --> 03:36:46.025
Um, so that's my opinion, Jesse Speck,

4064
03:36:46.285 --> 03:36:47.865
Um, yeah, I'm gonna support it as well.

4065
03:36:48.125 --> 03:36:49.945
Um, it doesn't necessarily mean

4066
03:36:49.945 --> 03:36:51.625
that we won't need our own bond at some point,

4067
03:36:51.645 --> 03:36:53.625
so it certainly isn't necessarily gonna be enough.

4068
03:36:54.165 --> 03:36:56.385
Um, and it's certainly not perfect as,

4069
03:36:56.465 --> 03:36:58.665
I don't think any proposition I've ever read from the state

4070
03:36:58.765 --> 03:37:02.345
has been, but um, it does save the 8.5 billion

4071
03:37:02.485 --> 03:37:03.985
for TK through 12 districts.

4072
03:37:03.985 --> 03:37:06.145
3.3 billion is supposed to be for new construction,

4073
03:37:06.145 --> 03:37:08.825
which would, um, enrolled would fall into, um,

4074
03:37:08.945 --> 03:37:11.545
I realized they're gonna give priority to some degree

4075
03:37:11.845 --> 03:37:13.905
for lower income, um, districts.

4076
03:37:13.965 --> 03:37:16.505
But, um, again, this is our best chance.

4077
03:37:16.765 --> 03:37:19.545
Um, it's our only chance, uh, really, um,

4078
03:37:20.285 --> 03:37:23.305
at least in this election cycle to get some sort

4079
03:37:23.305 --> 03:37:27.905
of state matching for the incredible amount of, um, tax our

4080
03:37:28.665 --> 03:37:29.745
residents of Dublin have paid

4081
03:37:29.765 --> 03:37:31.745
to build the beautiful schools we have.

4082
03:37:31.805 --> 03:37:35.385
So, um, I wanna try to get anything we can to, um,

4083
03:37:35.805 --> 03:37:39.145
def fray more, um, taxes that we,

4084
03:37:39.165 --> 03:37:40.985
or more bonds that we have to go out

4085
03:37:41.045 --> 03:37:43.825
for at some future point for the future facilities needs.

4086
03:37:43.845 --> 03:37:44.845
We have,

4087
03:37:48.055 --> 03:37:49.105
There's any other questions?

4088
03:37:49.725 --> 03:37:50.825
If not, I will take a motion.

4089
03:37:52.155 --> 03:37:55.085
Sure. I'll move that. We approve item K three.

4090
03:37:58.055 --> 03:38:00.555
I'll second. I have a motion. And second.

4091
03:38:00.655 --> 03:38:04.605
Any other motions? Trustee Wan? Aye.

4092
03:38:05.045 --> 03:38:06.695
Everyone else? Aye, aye,

4093
03:38:06.835 --> 03:38:07.835
Aye. No

4094
03:38:07.835 --> 03:38:08.515

4095
03:38:08.845 --> 03:38:09.845
Carries three to one.

4096
03:38:11.715 --> 03:38:15.215
All righty. That was everything on consent, right?

4097
03:38:15.715 --> 03:38:17.615
Uh, K five Oh, K five, sorry.

4098
03:38:17.755 --> 03:38:18.975
So I just had one quick question.

4099
03:38:19.675 --> 03:38:23.415
Um, there are changes to the, this new policy that,

4100
03:38:23.555 --> 03:38:24.855
not new, but updates to it.

4101
03:38:25.155 --> 03:38:27.055
And I just, I don't know if we clarified.

4102
03:38:27.075 --> 03:38:29.735
So if we have standing contracts at the time, um,

4103
03:38:29.735 --> 03:38:31.215
there's obviously law that

4104
03:38:31.525 --> 03:38:34.215
that determines if you have standing contracts at the time,

4105
03:38:34.275 --> 03:38:37.215
if they're in fact affected by changes to policies.

4106
03:38:37.635 --> 03:38:39.895
And I don't know if we ever had that answer from legal.

4107
03:38:41.425 --> 03:38:44.315
When does this become effective when the new contract is

4108
03:38:44.315 --> 03:38:47.315
written or does this apply to the existing contract,

4109
03:38:47.315 --> 03:38:48.995
in which case it would need to be revisited.

4110
03:38:51.065 --> 03:38:54.485
So, um, I'm I'm unclear on your question

4111
03:38:54.725 --> 03:38:56.405
'cause that was not something that was

4112
03:38:56.415 --> 03:38:57.805
asked for me to review.

4113
03:38:57.875 --> 03:39:00.845
What was asked was that last sentence, uh,

4114
03:39:00.845 --> 03:39:04.325
that last paragraph in the policy to have legal review that.

4115
03:39:04.705 --> 03:39:06.165
So can you please restate your question?

4116
03:39:06.665 --> 03:39:09.725
So when we update, this becomes current,

4117
03:39:09.945 --> 03:39:12.515
but if we already have a standing contract,

4118
03:39:12.535 --> 03:39:15.635
the standing contract is not updated even though we update

4119
03:39:15.635 --> 03:39:17.515
the policy after the contract has been signed.

4120
03:39:17.615 --> 03:39:19.995
Or do we need to go back and update the contract

4121
03:39:19.995 --> 03:39:21.435
because the policy has changed?

4122
03:39:22.055 --> 03:39:24.275
So what the policy is, is updating

4123
03:39:24.655 --> 03:39:26.555
and recommending components

4124
03:39:27.225 --> 03:39:30.235
that are in a superintendent's contract.

4125
03:39:30.695 --> 03:39:33.565
The only significant change from our past policy

4126
03:39:34.105 --> 03:39:36.925
to the new policy is that the severance

4127
03:39:37.585 --> 03:39:40.805
is no longer allowable in ed code for 18 months.

4128
03:39:40.955 --> 03:39:42.005
It's only 12 months.

4129
03:39:42.785 --> 03:39:44.725
For instance, my current contract only

4130
03:39:44.725 --> 03:39:45.885
allows for six months.

4131
03:39:46.385 --> 03:39:48.405
So no, nothing would change in the contract.

4132
03:39:49.075 --> 03:39:51.045
Okay. Thank you. That's my, my only request

4133
03:39:51.045 --> 03:39:53.205
for clarification is when it becomes updated. So

4134
03:39:53.205 --> 03:39:54.205
Thank you. And then the

4135
03:39:54.205 --> 03:39:57.605
last paragraph, um, our legal counsel agrees

4136
03:39:57.605 --> 03:39:58.805
that it is confusing.

4137
03:39:59.505 --> 03:40:01.245
He doesn't understand why it's there,

4138
03:40:01.595 --> 03:40:03.805
however it is in ed code.

4139
03:40:03.945 --> 03:40:07.365
And so the right for the board, uh, to do that, uh,

4140
03:40:07.365 --> 03:40:09.445
is there, but how it would actually be

4141
03:40:09.765 --> 03:40:11.485
implemented, he's unsure of.

4142
03:40:11.865 --> 03:40:14.685
So he recommended that crossing it out would not

4143
03:40:15.265 --> 03:40:16.965
impact our current process.

4144
03:40:23.605 --> 03:40:26.095
Okay. Does someone wanna make a motion?

4145
03:40:26.645 --> 03:40:28.575
Yeah, I'll move that. We approve item K five.

4146
03:40:29.325 --> 03:40:30.325
I'll Second.

4147
03:40:31.105 --> 03:40:34.405
Any other motions? Trustee Pei? Aye. Everyone else?

4148
03:40:34.985 --> 03:40:39.905
Aye, Aye. All right.

4149
03:40:40.135 --> 03:40:43.585
Next up we don't have any written reports for the evening.

4150
03:40:44.005 --> 03:40:48.985
Um, future items, is there anything pending that we need

4151
03:40:48.985 --> 03:40:50.345
to know about or anything people would like

4152
03:40:50.345 --> 03:40:51.385
to request at this point in time?

4153
03:40:54.945 --> 03:40:58.305
I would just like to update the board, uh, that, um,

4154
03:40:59.015 --> 03:41:02.705
regarding the fencing at Dublin High School, um,

4155
03:41:03.325 --> 03:41:06.105
the bid process requires a certain amount of time

4156
03:41:06.455 --> 03:41:07.825
that we go out for that bid.

4157
03:41:08.245 --> 03:41:11.625
Uh, so our goal is to have that bid, uh, completed

4158
03:41:12.085 --> 03:41:14.465
and brought to the board for discussion

4159
03:41:15.205 --> 03:41:17.225
and possible approval, uh,

4160
03:41:17.245 --> 03:41:19.105
at the first board meeting in November.

4161
03:41:22.875 --> 03:41:23.905
Thank you for that update.

4162
03:41:24.745 --> 03:41:29.055
Anything else, anything changes on the governance

4163
03:41:29.295 --> 03:41:31.065
calendar at this point?

4164
03:41:31.725 --> 03:41:33.945
All right. Trustee reports? Trustee speck.

4165
03:41:36.915 --> 03:41:38.335
Um, I only have one thing.

4166
03:41:38.415 --> 03:41:41.095
I was, um, I'm making sure my calendar.

4167
03:41:41.235 --> 03:41:45.695
Um, I was able to attend the Dublin l Jahan, um, last week,

4168
03:41:45.745 --> 03:41:47.095
which was a great time

4169
03:41:47.515 --> 03:41:51.175
and, um, enjoyed seeing, um, all the spirit from the kids at

4170
03:41:51.175 --> 03:41:55.175
that school and, um, just getting to be a part

4171
03:41:55.235 --> 03:41:56.495
of the program again.

4172
03:41:56.875 --> 03:41:57.895
That's all I have to report

4173
03:41:59.905 --> 03:42:00.915
Trustee Blackman.

4174
03:42:00.965 --> 03:42:02.035
Thank you. So, um,

4175
03:42:02.065 --> 03:42:05.075
something I'll just remind everybody here is I did attend,

4176
03:42:05.135 --> 03:42:06.675
um, what is required about, uh,

4177
03:42:06.675 --> 03:42:08.835
basically every two years we're required to, um,

4178
03:42:09.175 --> 03:42:10.235
attend ethics training.

4179
03:42:10.575 --> 03:42:12.875
So I don't know if the other board members have signed up

4180
03:42:12.875 --> 03:42:14.675
for it, but it needs to be done every two years.

4181
03:42:14.775 --> 03:42:16.715
So please do. It's very insightful.

4182
03:42:16.715 --> 03:42:19.675
It's led by our lawyers team, so I advise doing it.

4183
03:42:20.115 --> 03:42:22.115
I also, as I mentioned, attended CSBA

4184
03:42:22.135 --> 03:42:23.355
a's review of prop two.

4185
03:42:23.775 --> 03:42:26.355
Um, unfortunately the city, we were unable

4186
03:42:26.355 --> 03:42:27.675
to schedule the city liaison meeting.

4187
03:42:27.675 --> 03:42:28.995
This has been going on for about a year

4188
03:42:28.995 --> 03:42:33.325
and a half, so, um, I wish I could report back on some

4189
03:42:33.325 --> 03:42:34.925
of the changes and requests and updates,

4190
03:42:35.025 --> 03:42:36.805
but obviously we will wait again for

4191
03:42:36.805 --> 03:42:37.925
that to get rescheduled.

4192
03:42:37.925 --> 03:42:38.925
Thank you.

4193
03:42:41.195 --> 03:42:45.515
I have not seen a report. Um, I was able

4194
03:42:45.515 --> 03:42:47.035
to attend the teacher of the year event

4195
03:42:47.305 --> 03:42:48.595
last week, which was wonderful.

4196
03:42:48.815 --> 03:42:52.475
Um, we had a, um, some representatives from Murray staff,

4197
03:42:52.735 --> 03:42:54.875
um, and administration there and some district people.

4198
03:42:54.895 --> 03:42:57.195
It was great. Um, it's been really exciting.

4199
03:42:57.195 --> 03:42:59.515
I've gone three years and we've won two of the years.

4200
03:43:00.175 --> 03:43:01.235
Um, but it was really great.

4201
03:43:01.455 --> 03:43:05.195
Um, I highly recommend, um, anyone attend that, um,

4202
03:43:05.375 --> 03:43:07.795
in future years, um, whenever possible.

4203
03:43:08.415 --> 03:43:11.835
Um, it just really is inspiring all the great work

4204
03:43:11.835 --> 03:43:13.515
that's going on across the county.

4205
03:43:14.615 --> 03:43:17.955
Um, and our staff represent very well every year.

4206
03:43:18.375 --> 03:43:20.555
So that was great, um, to celebrate Lauren.

4207
03:43:20.695 --> 03:43:21.995
I'm glad we were able to have her here.

4208
03:43:22.895 --> 03:43:24.075
Um, 'cause yeah,

4209
03:43:24.075 --> 03:43:25.555
we didn't know she won until they announced her.

4210
03:43:25.555 --> 03:43:26.635
And so that was, that was great fun.

4211
03:43:26.975 --> 03:43:29.035
So I was really, really excited.

4212
03:43:29.115 --> 03:43:31.475
I wore my Murray purple and that was fun.

4213
03:43:32.135 --> 03:43:35.795
Um, and then, um, I was able

4214
03:43:35.795 --> 03:43:37.155
to attend the football game last weekend

4215
03:43:37.175 --> 03:43:39.235
and that was great fun just to see the bands

4216
03:43:39.235 --> 03:43:40.515
and the middle schoolers all there

4217
03:43:40.615 --> 03:43:43.595
and, um, all working on their shows, um,

4218
03:43:43.735 --> 03:43:44.915
and pulling all that together.

4219
03:43:45.035 --> 03:43:46.515
I know we've had some turn, you know, new,

4220
03:43:46.735 --> 03:43:47.915
new band director and everything.

4221
03:43:47.915 --> 03:43:50.115
So it's great to see all of that kind of coming together.

4222
03:43:50.975 --> 03:43:53.875
Um, and, and the great community building that

4223
03:43:53.875 --> 03:43:56.195
that happens at the different schools through the,

4224
03:43:56.335 --> 03:43:58.635
the sports, um, and band and, and everybody.

4225
03:43:59.015 --> 03:44:01.755
Um, it was nice and warm on Friday night

4226
03:44:01.755 --> 03:44:05.155
and looking forward, um, to all the homecoming festivities,

4227
03:44:05.415 --> 03:44:08.595
um, at Dublin High next week.

4228
03:44:08.855 --> 03:44:11.995
So I'm sure we'll be at many of those.

4229
03:44:12.495 --> 03:44:14.275
So, um, that is all I have for now.

4230
03:44:15.825 --> 03:44:17.505
I think I've spoke enough tonight. So I'll pass

4231
03:44:22.355 --> 03:44:23.695
At least once I fridge, turn my mic on.

4232
03:44:23.875 --> 03:44:25.975
Um, anything else?

4233
03:44:27.715 --> 03:44:29.695
Anyone needs any evaluation?

4234
03:44:30.915 --> 03:44:33.955
Um, if not, I will take a motion

4235
03:44:34.055 --> 03:44:36.275
to adjourn. I'll move that we

4236
03:44:36.275 --> 03:44:37.435
Adjourn. I'll second,

4237
03:44:38.175 --> 03:44:39.175
Uh, trustee PE 20.

4238
03:44:39.815 --> 03:44:43.075
Aye. All in favor? Aye. Aye. Aye. Alrighty.

4239
03:44:43.075 --> 03:44:45.435
We are adjourned. Our next meeting will be Tuesday,

4240
03:44:45.505 --> 03:44:46.635
October 22nd.

4241
03:44:46.805 --> 03:44:47.435
We'll see you then.
