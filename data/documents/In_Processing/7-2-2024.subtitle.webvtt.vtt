evening. Uh, and I'll take full responsibility that this

58
00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:34.037
was a resolution that should have been brought at our last

59
00:16:34.037 --> 00:16:37.927
board meeting, uh, as the board knows we Consolidated the 2

60
00:16:37.927 --> 00:16:41.377
board meetings to 1, uh, and staff was really focused on

61
00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:44.413
the direction the board was going with the sfid, uh

62
00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:47.977
resolution, uh for a potential Bond, uh, and this was just

63
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.957
an oversight on our part and I apologize.

64
00:16:49.957 --> 00:16:54.097
guys for that so tonight's resolution is to allow for the

65
00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:59.848
board to authorize um for to inform the county, uh office

66
00:16:59.848 --> 00:17:03.236

67
00:17:03.237 --> 00:17:08.467
Voters, uh for us to actually uh order a an election, uh

68
00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:11.317
request for consolidation and specifications for the

69
00:17:11.317 --> 00:17:15.817
election, uh order and in this case, uh, this is for the

70
00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:20.332
areas of 1 3 and 4. Uh, and so we need this resolution, uh

71
00:17:20.377 --> 00:17:24.327
to meet the statutory deadline, uh, which is uh the 5th of

72
00:17:24.327 --> 00:17:27.157
July to get this resolution to the register of Voters.

73
00:17:27.767 --> 00:17:31.407
Thank you for that clarification. Um trustee Terrier. Yes.

74
00:17:31.407 --> 00:17:34.947
I have a I have a clarifying question. Sure. Okay, great,

75
00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:39.057
um in the resolution, I noticed we're maintaining the

76
00:17:39.597 --> 00:17:44.137
500 dollar uh payment that goes towards

77
00:17:44.137 --> 00:17:50.457
the uh candidate statement and those candidate statement

78
00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:53.327
fees are based on kind of the size of the election. I know

79
00:17:53.327 --> 00:17:56.187
it's more for presidential election than

80
00:17:57.008 --> 00:18:00.678
Cubatur and all action, but but not a whole lot.

81
00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:03.708
but my question is, um

82
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:06.858
when I did my first election.

83
00:18:07.218 --> 00:18:09.568
16 years ago now

84
00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:10.818
um

85
00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:14.248
the $500 covered.

86
00:18:14.248 --> 00:18:20.538
The full cost of the candidate statement and as in the

87
00:18:20.538 --> 00:18:25.908
intervening years the 500 dollars now is is

88
00:18:25.908 --> 00:18:29.748
based on the last time I ran a year ago was roughly a

89
00:18:29.748 --> 00:18:31.868
little more than half.

90
00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:35.198
and I'm guessing this time it's going to be about half of

91
00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:40.088
the cost of the of the of the statement and

92
00:18:40.088 --> 00:18:44.968
I I was wondering did you give any consideration?

93
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.338
To raising that due to higher costs over the years because

94
00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:51.858
like I say 16 years ago covered the whole cost.

95
00:18:54.738 --> 00:18:58.498
I did not give any consideration to that. Uh, I didn't take

96
00:18:58.498 --> 00:19:01.918
that into the account. Uh, this is something that we could

97
00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:04.438
make the adjustment of the board. We like to change that

98
00:19:04.438 --> 00:19:08.278
amount. I have the ability to do that before I send it off.

99
00:19:08.278 --> 00:19:12.658
Um, but uh, it was the same amount that we did at the last

100
00:19:12.658 --> 00:19:15.478
election. It says I wasn't here for the last election.

101
00:19:15.478 --> 00:19:17.743
Well, I guess I was here for the last election know it

102
00:19:17.743 --> 00:19:18.388
wasn't

103
00:19:18.888 --> 00:19:23.560
I was here since it wasn't any issue was brought up then we

104
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.758
just copied it for this 1 so I it was a

105
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.148
I just we're bringing up then since I would be 1 of the

106
00:19:30.148 --> 00:19:33.253
people benefiting but now I'm not 1 of the people

107
00:19:33.253 --> 00:19:38.008
benefiting so I feel on a little firmer ground to uh to to

108
00:19:38.008 --> 00:19:39.628
to bring it up.

109
00:19:39.628 --> 00:19:43.088
um anyway when we get to the

110
00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:49.788
Comment section of this, uh item, I I may propose that we

111
00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:51.358
increase that. Thank you.

112
00:19:52.968 --> 00:19:55.618
Is there any other questions?

113
00:19:57.558 --> 00:20:00.058
Does someone want to make a motion?

114
00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:01.668
regarding this

115
00:20:02.238 --> 00:20:06.718
Um, I'll make a motion that we approve.

116
00:20:06.718 --> 00:20:12.948
resolution 202425 Dash 03

117
00:20:12.948 --> 00:20:16.728
with the modification to increase

118
00:20:16.728 --> 00:20:21.648
the uh amount paid for the candidate statement

119
00:20:21.648 --> 00:20:25.628
from 500 to 900

120
00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:34.958
I'll second.

121
00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:39.192
How much was it? Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:42.823
We have a motion in a second. Um the original

123
00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:45.213
um

124
00:20:45.213 --> 00:20:48.033
resolution called for 500 and that's what it's been for a

125
00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:50.643
while and you're sending to 900.

126
00:20:50.643 --> 00:20:53.803
Are there any additional motions or questions, uh trustee

127
00:20:53.803 --> 00:20:54.553
spec?

128
00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:57.223
I don't have another motion. I would just say I'm I'm

129
00:20:57.223 --> 00:21:00.703
definitely on board with increasing it. I I'm the only

130
00:21:00.703 --> 00:21:02.695
reason I didn't second is I would have gone with 800

131
00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:05.608
because I feel like I didn't have to pay it 2 years ago

132
00:21:05.608 --> 00:21:08.923
because no 1 rann against me but 4 years ago. Um, I believe

133
00:21:08.923 --> 00:21:17.263
it was in the 8 0 0. 0 0 0

134
00:21:23.803 --> 00:21:29.173
but if if you want to make a an alternate motion of 800,

135
00:21:29.173 --> 00:21:30.733
uh, we can vote on that 1

136
00:21:30.733 --> 00:21:34.153
Okay, then I'll I'll make an alternate motion of.

137
00:21:34.353 --> 00:21:36.103
approving

138
00:21:36.103 --> 00:21:41.993
resolution number 2425 Dash 03, uh with the 800 dollar

139
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.853
limit on the dollar amount.

140
00:21:44.313 --> 00:21:47.983
Do you want to do it up to 800?

141
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.423
Or do you want to up to up to or including 800? Okay.

142
00:21:55.053 --> 00:21:56.563
Hold on a second.

143
00:21:56.813 --> 00:21:59.613
Okay. So now we have

144
00:21:59.613 --> 00:22:01.153
another motion

145
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.943
We can go to go for a third unless.

146
00:22:04.383 --> 00:22:07.873
I don't see anyone else making a motion on that 1.

147
00:22:07.873 --> 00:22:09.463
um

148
00:22:09.463 --> 00:22:11.553
Then I'm going to go ahead and call for a vote starting

149
00:22:11.553 --> 00:22:17.165
with our last motion, which is um up to 800 dollars for the

150
00:22:17.165 --> 00:22:18.053
ballot statement.

151
00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:21.323
um, trustee pwani I

152
00:22:21.323 --> 00:22:22.513
everyone else

153
00:22:22.513 --> 00:22:26.343
I I motion carries unanimously.

154
