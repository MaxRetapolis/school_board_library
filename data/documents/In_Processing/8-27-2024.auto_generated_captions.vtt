And we vendors, Emerald also had its back

186
00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.205
to school night on August 20th, which

187
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:24.085
provided a wonderful opportunity for parents

188
00:12:24.085 --> 00:12:26.325
and guardians to visit their students' classrooms,

189
00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:29.245
meet their teachers, and learn about course expectations.

190
00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.845
Doing all of this while following their student schedules,

191
00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:34.405
period by period classes at Valley

192
00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:35.485
High School are going great.

193
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.885
They started the year with an ice cream social event

194
00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:39.245
sponsored by their leadership class.

195
00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:41.605
This year, students are taking a culinary class

196
00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:43.245
and have started college by taking a Las

197
00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:44.485

198
00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:47.005
Students who are in good standing with academics

199
00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:48.045
and attendance will be going to the

200
00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:49.765
A'S baseball game next Thursday.

201
00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:52.725
Dublin High School seniors hiked up Number Hill

202
00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:54.565
for their Senior Sunrise event on Wednesday,

203
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:58.325
August 21st at 5:00 AM It was a memorable experience filled

204
00:12:58.325 --> 00:13:00.605
with spirit and excitement of beginning their final year.

205
00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:03.045
That same morning, Dublin High School had its Back

206
00:13:03.045 --> 00:13:05.325
to School rally, which I got to be the mc of,

207
00:13:05.325 --> 00:13:06.365
and had an amazing time.

208
00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:08.205
The theme was Olympics

209
00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:09.885
and there was a huge pride coming from all the

210
00:13:09.885 --> 00:13:10.925
classes throughout all the games.

211
00:13:11.575 --> 00:13:12.645
Admin also had a chance

212
00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:14.125
to talk more about their CARES policy,

213
00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:15.845
which has been highly emphasized.

214
00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:19.625
This year, from August 16th to August 18th,

215
00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:22.265
I attended the National Student Board Member Association

216
00:13:22.265 --> 00:13:23.985
Start Conference, which was held online.

217
00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.465
I had the opportunity to collaborate

218
00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:28.345
with student board members from across the nation,

219
00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:30.905
gaining hands-on experience on, in developing

220
00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:32.865
and presenting a board of educ Board

221
00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:34.265
of Education policy proposal.

222
00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:37.105
Through council sessions, the conference

223
00:13:37.345 --> 00:13:39.305
provided invaluable training on essential aspects

224
00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:40.705
of broad service, ensuring I'm

225
00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:41.905
well prepared for my role this term.

226
00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.225
And throughout high school,

227
00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:46.225
many students have experienced significant stress

228
00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:49.185
or anxiety marked by constant worry due to uncertainty about

229
00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:52.665
how specific events in their academic careers might impact

230
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:53.785
their college admission outcomes.

231
00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:56.025
To address this, I'm working on a mission

232
00:13:56.025 --> 00:13:58.625
to interview regional college admissions officers asking

233
00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:00.945
detailed questions on how admissions committees interpret

234
00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:03.625
grade trends, the impact of disciplinary actions,

235
00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:05.505
and the significance of personal statements,

236
00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:07.425
and the additional information section

237
00:14:07.485 --> 00:14:08.625
in the application process.

238
00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.585
These interviews will be recorded

239
00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:12.865
and shared with high school student bodies aiming

240
00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:14.825
to clarify concerns and reduce confusion.

241
00:14:15.685 --> 00:14:17.905
Lastly, most fall sports have already started at all the

242
00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:19.265
high schools, and everyone is eager

243
00:14:19.265 --> 00:14:20.305
to begin attending the games.

244
00:14:20.515 --> 00:14:21.515
Thank you.

245
00:14:23.085 --> 00:14:24.345
All right. Thank you. We are off

246
00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:25.825

250
00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:43.035
I just wanna make sure DTA didn't pop on. Right.

251
00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:46.635
Okay. Then we're gonna keep moving.

252
00:14:47.585 --> 00:14:50.315

We've encumbered. Um,

303
00:17:23.095 --> 00:17:24.575

304
00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:26.855

00:18:11.575 --> 00:18:13.525
Phase two is currently in design.

319

341
00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.945
Our next project that I'd like

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:23.265
to update is Emerald High School, phase two.

343
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:27.505

358
00:20:05.835 --> 00:20:08.135
Uh, we're on schedule actually right now.

359
00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:13.165
We're in front of the schedule, uh, by like three weeks.

360
00:20:13.865 --> 00:20:16.085
Uh, but, you know, things happen toward the end.

361
00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:20.405
So we're really looking at, uh, completion in probably April

362
00:20:21.085 --> 00:20:24.545
of 2025, more than enough time to get ready

363
00:20:24.565 --> 00:20:25.785
for the following school year.

364
00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:29.065
So we're feeling really good about that. There were nine.

365
00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:30.425
There was $91 million,

366
00:20:30.685 --> 00:20:34.625
$132,581 allocated for this project.

367
00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:39.905
Out of that, we have 77,986,850

368
00:20:39.915 --> 00:20:44.465
encumbered with a remainder of about 13,000,145,

369
00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:48.165
uh, thousand $731 right now.

370
00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:49.845
That's uncommitted in this project.

371
00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:57.095
Uh, the next, uh, project I'd like

372
00:20:57.095 --> 00:20:59.575
to update you on is the Emerald High School, phase three,

373
00:21:00.085 --> 00:21:02.495
Catherine C quote, performing arts center.

374
00:21:03.435 --> 00:21:06.865
We, uh, we have, um, it's under design right now.

375
00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:08.505
It's a lease leaseback project.

376
00:21:09.245 --> 00:21:13.905
Uh, we're probably around 70% in the design right now.

377
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:16.025
We should be, uh,

378
00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:19.145
complete sometime in November for the design.

379
00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:22.425
At that point, we'll do an exercise where we'll work

380
00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:27.305
with our contractor BHM to do a, uh, assessment of the cost

381
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:30.065
and to look at value engineering

382
00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:33.065
or, um, constructability review at that time.

383
00:21:33.165 --> 00:21:34.425
So that'll happen in November,

384
00:21:34.805 --> 00:21:36.945
and we hope to submit to DSA in November.

385
00:21:38.165 --> 00:21:41.225
Uh, we also are working on the solar structures as,

386
00:21:41.845 --> 00:21:45.145
so solar was planned for the, the site

387
00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:46.905
as part of phase two.

388
00:21:47.045 --> 00:21:51.025
We moved that to phase three. That was a DSA concern.

389
00:21:51.975 --> 00:21:56.245
Phase two did not require solar. Phase three does.

390
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:59.205
So we moved that work to phase three so

391
00:21:59.205 --> 00:22:01.245
that we could have a single submittal to DSA

392
00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:02.565
that would encompass all that work.

393
00:22:04.025 --> 00:22:07.885
Um, you know, we're using, we have user feedback going on.

394
00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:09.885
There's a user group we're meeting at least

395
00:22:09.975 --> 00:22:11.205
every, every two weeks.

396
00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:14.445
Uh, we do an executive meeting every week on the theater.

397
00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:16.205
So we're, things are moving right along.

398
00:22:16.495 --> 00:22:18.525
We're on track to break ground in the spring

399
00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:20.925
of 2020 in spring of 25.

400
00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:24.365
Uh, that could wound up being early summer.

401
00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:25.445
Right now, we're, you know,

402
00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:26.605
trying to work through the schedule.

403
00:22:26.785 --> 00:22:30.565
It all depends upon how quickly we can get through the DSA.

404
00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:32.885
So, but we're on, we're on track.

405
00:22:33.065 --> 00:22:36.765
Um, right now we have 38,315,000,

406
00:22:37.915 --> 00:22:40.095
uh, $672 allocated.

407
00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:44.855
Encumbered is only 2,526,506.

408
00:22:44.855 --> 00:22:48.575
That's for architectural and, uh, pre-construction services.

409
00:22:49.155 --> 00:22:53.775
So the remainder, the 35,789,166

410
00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:58.455
are project costs that have yet to be, uh, uh, allocated,

411
00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:01.895
or they're allocated, but they're yet to be encumbered.

412
00:23:02.155 --> 00:23:04.175
So we do not have contracts for that amount,

413
00:23:04.315 --> 00:23:04.895
but we will,

414
00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:11.735
uh, another project that we're working on is, uh,

415
00:23:11.795 --> 00:23:16.775
air conditioning systems at DHS Fallon, uh, middle school

416
00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:19.455
and Wells Middle School, four gyms all together.

417
00:23:20.235 --> 00:23:23.495
Um, we're gonna, we'll be completing Fallon this January.

418
00:23:24.155 --> 00:23:26.895
Uh, wells and DHS will be completed in November.

419
00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:32.895
Um, the budget info on that was $6,100,000 was allocated.

420
00:23:33.305 --> 00:23:37.815
Right now we have 4,446,138 encumbered

421
00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:40.495
with, you know, our main contracts in place.

422
00:23:40.595 --> 00:23:41.655
The materials ordered.

423
00:23:42.035 --> 00:23:42.655
So there's a

424
00:23:42.655 --> 00:23:47.205
$1,653,862 remainder.

425
00:23:47.785 --> 00:23:50.325
Uh, we'll, you know, have a pretty good idea of

426
00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:53.805
what the actual remainder on this project will be.

427
00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:56.365
Uh, sometime in Jan, it'll be completed in January.

428
00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:58.045
So we'll have accurate numbers in January.

429
00:23:59.975 --> 00:24:04.915
And, um, Mr. Moore, the somewhat, um, delay on the Fallon,

430
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:07.475
um, actually on all three of these is simply

431
00:24:07.475 --> 00:24:11.275
because of the delay in receiving the units from

432
00:24:11.515 --> 00:24:12.515
Overseas. Yes. The,

433
00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:15.995
the, the, the air conditioning units themselves

434
00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:21.595
are not your average or your normal equipment.

435
00:24:21.905 --> 00:24:23.315
They fit on the rooftop.

436
00:24:23.345 --> 00:24:25.395
They had certain parameters where they had to meet

437
00:24:25.415 --> 00:24:28.435
for weight and size and power.

438
00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:31.635
So they were custom ordered and custom made.

439
00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:33.915
Um, some of them had really long lead times.

440
00:24:34.575 --> 00:24:36.955
Uh, it seems like air conditioning equipment

441
00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:41.775
and electrical gear has not recovered from pandemic,

442
00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:45.415
um, supply chain issues, we're still having them.

443
00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:47.135
A lot of that is worldwide.

444
00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:49.855
Most of these companies operate internationally,

445
00:24:50.235 --> 00:24:52.375
so they manufacture in other countries.

446
00:24:52.375 --> 00:24:54.615
They operate in, in hundreds of countries,

447
00:24:54.765 --> 00:24:56.655
manufacturing dozens of countries.

448
00:24:56.715 --> 00:24:58.655
So, but what, what, what, we're there now.

449
00:24:58.655 --> 00:25:00.535
We have, uh, we have a good schedule

450
00:25:00.755 --> 00:25:03.415
and, uh, we're, we're, we, we've been assured that, uh,

451
00:25:03.515 --> 00:25:04.815
the equipment will be here in time

452
00:25:04.815 --> 00:25:05.895
to finish by these states.

453
00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:12.945
Oops. Oh, Cottonwood Creek Gym.

454
00:25:13.485 --> 00:25:16.385
Um, if you've been out to Cottonwood Creek gym,

455
00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:17.785
it looks like it's almost done.

456
00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:19.385
I mean, we look at it, we go, wow.

457
00:25:19.415 --> 00:25:22.145
Look at all the work that's been done in the, in the last,

458
00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:24.345
uh, year or so.

459
00:25:24.765 --> 00:25:26.465
Uh, completion will be this October.

460
00:25:26.605 --> 00:25:28.385
So we indeed are almost done.

461
00:25:28.715 --> 00:25:31.665
We'll be putting in dry, uh, we'll be installing the, uh,

462
00:25:31.705 --> 00:25:34.185
hardwood flooring, which is pretty much the last thing

463
00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:36.585
that needs to be done, uh, sometime next month.

464
00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:39.815
Um, and we should be done by October.

465
00:25:40.775 --> 00:25:43.555
Uh, the budget information, we, we, we were,

466
00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:48.475
we allocated $15,585,145 to this.

467
00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:53.715
We've encumbered so far, 13,389,548

468
00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:54.115
with a

469
00:25:54.215 --> 00:25:58.955
$2,195,597 remainder.

470
00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:01.795
Like I said, that's not guaranteed to be at the end

471
00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:02.915
of the project, but right now,

472
00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:03.995
this is what we're looking at.

473
00:26:04.055 --> 00:26:07.355
It looks really good. So we're happy about that.

474
00:26:08.865 --> 00:26:11.545
Shamrock Hills, uh, TK eight School.

475
00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:15.025
So increment one, the civil package, uh, has gone

476
00:26:15.025 --> 00:26:16.745
through DSA back check and been approved.

477
00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:20.105
So we'll be starting, uh, actual moving dirt

478
00:26:20.105 --> 00:26:21.625
around sometime next month.

479
00:26:22.775 --> 00:26:26.395
Um, increment two, the structures have been submitted

480
00:26:26.395 --> 00:26:28.155
to DSA, but we're waiting for approval.

481
00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:31.675
Uh, the neighborhood notices have been posted in July

482
00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:32.995
for upcoming activities.

483
00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:37.155
And right now we're on track to, to, uh, break ground.

484
00:26:37.575 --> 00:26:40.835
Um, like I said, this fall, like in about a month, uh,

485
00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:42.515
budget information,

486
00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:43.035
we've got a

487
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.485
a hundred and two million five hundred sixty six thousand two hundred thirteen thousand dollars

488
00:26:47.635 --> 00:26:48.245
allocated.

489
00:26:49.095 --> 00:26:53.725
We've only encumbered 4,873,463,

490
00:26:54.385 --> 00:26:57.005
and we have a 97,690

491
00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:01.485
or $97,692,750 remainder.

492
00:27:01.675 --> 00:27:03.685
That is for the bulk of the construction,

493
00:27:03.895 --> 00:27:06.925
which we still have not allocated or written a contract.

494
00:27:07.095 --> 00:27:11.935
We'll be coming to the board soon for the, um, for the, uh,

495
00:27:11.935 --> 00:27:16.795
incremental, uh, uh, uh, maximum guaranteed price.

496
00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:19.275
Uh, that will be, we should be coming to the board for that.

497
00:27:19.275 --> 00:27:22.485
Within the next month, we'll be ready to break.

498
00:27:22.545 --> 00:27:25.045
And after that's approved, they'll break their break ground.

499
00:27:25.335 --> 00:27:27.845
Right now, they're in the process of getting bids

500
00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:29.445
and securing all their bid packages

501
00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:32.885
and submitting a final, uh, GMP to us

502
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:34.765
so we can bring it to the board for approval.

503
00:27:37.535 --> 00:27:40.395
So, any questions on the current projects?

504
00:27:43.685 --> 00:27:45.535
Trustee Blackman and then Trustee Speck.

505
00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:48.495
Thank you very much for the presentation, for the update.

506
00:27:48.495 --> 00:27:50.415
It's great to see all the work that's been done and,

507
00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:52.055
and just the quality of the projects.

508
00:27:52.575 --> 00:27:54.455
I had a question. I'm glad we have the Shamrock Hills.

509
00:27:54.515 --> 00:27:57.895
One last. So, um, I noticed in Shamrock Hills that

510
00:27:57.895 --> 00:28:00.615
that's an image, granted, it's just an artist conception.

511
00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:03.455
Yes. That's the NPR and we have basketball hoops in it.

512
00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:05.375
So I just wanna be certain that I understand

513
00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:08.695
that even though we're building a gymnasium, I thought for

514
00:28:08.695 --> 00:28:11.015
that project, we are also building the NPR

515
00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:12.255
to accommodate sports.

516
00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.495
I just wanna make sure I Yes, that's correct.

517
00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:17.135
And is that because the program, we,

518
00:28:17.135 --> 00:28:19.935
because one of the reasons why we were building a gym at

519
00:28:20.145 --> 00:28:23.175
Cottonwood Creek is so that we didn't have to tax the NPR

520
00:28:23.175 --> 00:28:25.215
with PE and other requirements.

521
00:28:25.235 --> 00:28:26.855
So I just wanna make sure I understand.

522
00:28:27.395 --> 00:28:30.295
Is this something that is just, is there a programmed use?

523
00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.135
I'm, I'm just trying to understand why we put

524
00:28:32.325 --> 00:28:35.415
Well, it, it's, the, it in there is a TK through eight,

525
00:28:35.415 --> 00:28:37.335
which is the same as Cottonwood Creek.

526
00:28:37.395 --> 00:28:39.535
Yes. So we have an NPR, and,

527
00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:42.215
and they have, they have, you know, it's a, it's,

528
00:28:42.215 --> 00:28:45.855
it's an NPR, it's, it's a elementary school type NPR.

529
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:48.925
It's a little larger because we're gonna accommodate middle

530
00:28:48.925 --> 00:28:50.405
school students for lunch also.

531
00:28:50.905 --> 00:28:52.925
But the 300 or so middle school students

532
00:28:52.925 --> 00:28:55.365
that we have there are gonna be utilizing

533
00:28:55.365 --> 00:28:57.285
that gym just like we would at Cottonwood.

534
00:28:58.295 --> 00:29:00.475
So are you asking why do we use this image?

535
00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:02.825
No, it was more a question,

536
00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:03.905
because I know in cases

537
00:29:03.955 --> 00:29:05.985
where we have like elementary school spaces,

538
00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:07.465
or at least at like Cottonwood

539
00:29:07.465 --> 00:29:10.825
until they have their gymnasium, they're using their NPR as

540
00:29:10.825 --> 00:29:14.865
that PE space and their NPR use for dining.

541
00:29:14.865 --> 00:29:16.305
Right. This Will all be built at the same time.

542
00:29:16.695 --> 00:29:17.705
Okay. I just was curious.

543
00:29:17.945 --> 00:29:20.585
'cause it looks like the old Cottonwood Creek one,

544
00:29:20.645 --> 00:29:22.585
and that's why I thought we built the gymnasium,

545
00:29:22.685 --> 00:29:24.025
so we didn't have to do PE in this.

546
00:29:24.025 --> 00:29:25.825
This is just something to illustrate a

547
00:29:25.825 --> 00:29:26.985
concept. That's all. It's

548
00:29:26.985 --> 00:29:27.985
Not. Sorry. Thank you. That

549
00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:28.465
really helps.

550
00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:31.585
Um, there was a couple other questions that I had.

551
00:29:31.605 --> 00:29:35.145
Was, um, in the remainder number for the theater, I presume

552
00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.265
that's just whenever you mention remainder,

553
00:29:37.365 --> 00:29:40.945
that's just monies that haven't been, um, contracted out yet

554
00:29:41.065 --> 00:29:42.085
for each of the projects?

555
00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:47.835
Yes. We don't have a, we, we do not have A-A-A-A-A, uh,

556
00:29:47.835 --> 00:29:49.755
we haven't even submitted to DSA yet,

557
00:29:50.215 --> 00:29:52.675
so there is no construction contract.

558
00:29:52.975 --> 00:29:56.475
So you'll, we'll come back with A GMP for that.

559
00:29:56.985 --> 00:30:00.395
Once that project is released from DSA, we'll come

560
00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:01.795
to the board with the GMP.

561
00:30:02.615 --> 00:30:06.165
Thank you. And then the one last question.

562
00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:07.965
I know you said you had a lot, little bit

563
00:30:07.965 --> 00:30:10.845
of wiggle room time-wise for Emerald High School, um,

564
00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:13.885
with this new tower phase, which sounds great.

565
00:30:14.165 --> 00:30:15.765
I appreciate hearing that given what occurred

566
00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:17.965
with the weather during the winter seasons a while ago.

567
00:30:18.195 --> 00:30:20.405
Yeah. Um, the one question I had though was

568
00:30:20.405 --> 00:30:22.845
that we do have students on the campus right now,

569
00:30:22.945 --> 00:30:24.445
and there are construction activities

570
00:30:24.445 --> 00:30:25.685
that are occurring in parallel

571
00:30:25.685 --> 00:30:26.805
to having those students present.

572
00:30:27.385 --> 00:30:30.005
So has there been any discussion given the recent events in

573
00:30:30.005 --> 00:30:32.845
the last day or so of actually trying to work

574
00:30:32.845 --> 00:30:37.045
with a contractor to basically maybe schedule things

575
00:30:37.145 --> 00:30:39.205
and activities that are being done on the site

576
00:30:39.555 --> 00:30:41.485
that don't necessarily hamper

577
00:30:41.665 --> 00:30:44.005
or affect students while they're in the class?

578
00:30:44.795 --> 00:30:46.045
I'll say this carefully as I can

579
00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:47.165
without bringing it. Why? Yeah.

580
00:30:47.165 --> 00:30:48.925
Well, we're working both ways with that.

581
00:30:49.185 --> 00:30:51.205
So we're, we're working with Francis to try

582
00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:52.925
to minimize any disruption to the students.

583
00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.685
And Francis is working with BHM to try

584
00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:58.925
to minimize any destruct any, any disruption

585
00:30:58.925 --> 00:31:00.045
of the contracting.

586
00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:02.325
And I think we've done a pretty good job so far.

587
00:31:02.385 --> 00:31:06.005
So we're working very closely together, um, in order to try

588
00:31:06.005 --> 00:31:07.685
to make sure that things go smoothly.

589
00:31:07.925 --> 00:31:09.525
I mean, there, there's always little mishaps

590
00:31:09.525 --> 00:31:10.525
and things that happen here and there,

591
00:31:10.825 --> 00:31:15.565
but BHM has been very responsive as far as locking things,

592
00:31:15.565 --> 00:31:17.885
putting up gates, coordinating things off,

593
00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:20.405
setting up pathways and walkways, marking 'em,

594
00:31:20.405 --> 00:31:22.605
and making sure that they're safe communicating

595
00:31:22.605 --> 00:31:25.205
with Francis here, you know, here's, here's

596
00:31:25.205 --> 00:31:27.405
how we navigate these obstructions.

597
00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:29.805
So I think we're doing a really good job there.

598
00:31:30.065 --> 00:31:32.645
Um, and, um, both BHM

599
00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:35.125
and Francis are working very closely together

600
00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:37.085
to minimize any kind of disruption at all.

601
00:31:37.825 --> 00:31:39.565
Um, I know we're supposed to be asking questions,

602
00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:42.685
but if it's okay as a follow-up to just share that

603
00:31:42.945 --> 00:31:45.525
beyond just the logistics of those sort

604
00:31:45.525 --> 00:31:47.285
of managing a site under construction,

605
00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.685
if some consideration could be given

606
00:31:48.745 --> 00:31:51.405
to things you don't necessarily think about

607
00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:52.965
on a project schedule.

608
00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:56.245
For example, tar being poured on a roof and the smell of it.

609
00:31:56.635 --> 00:31:58.925
Yeah. That now that that activity is gonna,

610
00:31:59.065 --> 00:32:03.285
it has about a three week duration, so it's kind of hard to,

611
00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:05.685
I mean, if it was a weekend, we'd arrange

612
00:32:05.685 --> 00:32:06.685
to have it done on a weekend,

613
00:32:06.945 --> 00:32:08.605
or if there was a, you know, a couple days off

614
00:32:08.605 --> 00:32:10.445
and we could accomplish it in a couple

615
00:32:10.445 --> 00:32:12.285
days, we would do that.

616
00:32:12.385 --> 00:32:14.445
But it's a three week duration to build

617
00:32:14.445 --> 00:32:15.885
that roof up and to finish it.

618
00:32:16.145 --> 00:32:19.125
And we need to do that before it starts raining.

619
00:32:19.265 --> 00:32:22.925
So this is a critical path item, so we need to do it now.

620
00:32:22.945 --> 00:32:24.045
And we are doing it now,

621
00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:26.645
and we're making a com accommodations at the school to try

622
00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:27.725
to minimize the smell.

623
00:32:28.345 --> 00:32:30.045
Uh, but that's really all we can do.

624
00:32:30.045 --> 00:32:32.985
We don't have a choice right now to reschedule that

625
00:32:32.985 --> 00:32:34.905
or try to work it around the school schedule.

626
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:43.245
Okay. Um, uh, yeah, I have a few questions.

627
00:32:43.385 --> 00:32:44.525
Um, first off, thank you.

628
00:32:44.825 --> 00:32:46.885
Um, and it's great to see some of, so many

629
00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:49.645
of these under budget, um, or tracking that way.

630
00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:51.925
I know that they're not done, but, um, that's a great sign.

631
00:32:52.265 --> 00:32:54.485
Um, could we go back up to the Murray slide?

632
00:32:54.565 --> 00:32:59.085
I think slide three. Um, it talks about the, um, remodel

633
00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:00.805
of the existing NPR to a library,

634
00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:02.925
the play structure and the installation.

635
00:33:03.265 --> 00:33:05.325
And it says substantial completion fall.

636
00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:07.405
What, what exactly do you mean by substantial?

637
00:33:07.405 --> 00:33:08.845
What does that mean? Something's left

638
00:33:08.865 --> 00:33:09.925
out, or One of those is

639
00:33:10.515 --> 00:33:12.565
Well, right now we, we, you know, we,

640
00:33:12.565 --> 00:33:14.045
that's just a construction term.

641
00:33:14.045 --> 00:33:16.005
We use substantial completion. Okay.

642
00:33:16.025 --> 00:33:20.165
Um, there may be some things left over that needs to happen

643
00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:22.525
after that, like some fencing or something like that.

644
00:33:22.635 --> 00:33:23.685
Okay. I'm not prepared

645
00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:25.325
to say yes or no yet. Sure. This is a year

646
00:33:25.325 --> 00:33:25.645
Out. Okay.

647
00:33:25.645 --> 00:33:28.045
And since this is a whole over a year away Yeah.

648
00:33:28.345 --> 00:33:31.045
Um, we're kind of hedging our bets on that, but we got it.

649
00:33:31.045 --> 00:33:32.445
We plan on having it finished in the fall.

650
00:33:32.785 --> 00:33:35.685
So when we say fall, do we, do you expect them

651
00:33:35.745 --> 00:33:37.645
to come back to school with it completed?

652
00:33:37.685 --> 00:33:40.685
I, I hope so. Okay. So that is a potential that Yeah, well,

653
00:33:40.705 --> 00:33:42.815
At least mostly complete.

654
00:33:43.005 --> 00:33:45.375
Okay. So, I mean, we're hoping they are able to use

655
00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:47.695
Things like use the library Exactly.

656
00:33:47.695 --> 00:33:50.055
Yeah. Use the play field, that kind of thing. Right. Yeah.

657
00:33:50.205 --> 00:33:52.215
Okay. That's what the substantial completion means.

658
00:33:52.215 --> 00:33:54.255
They're able to use it. Okay.

659
00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:56.255
Yeah. Okay. But might still have a

660
00:33:56.255 --> 00:33:57.495
few little things here and there.

661
00:33:57.525 --> 00:34:00.135
Okay, great. Um, on Dublin l um,

662
00:34:00.475 --> 00:34:02.855
so the first part talks about the project status on phase

663
00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:04.015
one, um,

664
00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:07.055
but it doesn't talk about the lunch pavilion, which I,

665
00:34:07.215 --> 00:34:10.575
I fully understand is very dependent on these things being

666
00:34:10.575 --> 00:34:15.015
completed so that the admin can move into their spots so

667
00:34:15.015 --> 00:34:17.895
that you can then, um, demo the admin building.

668
00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:20.415
But what, what's the timeline on that demo

669
00:34:20.515 --> 00:34:22.615
of the admin building and lunch pavilion?

670
00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:25.215
Like, where does that fit into the timing?

671
00:34:25.835 --> 00:34:27.855
Uh, the demo of the admin building.

672
00:34:28.355 --> 00:34:29.655
The current admin building. Right.

673
00:34:29.655 --> 00:34:30.935
Because that's where the lunch pavilion will be going.

674
00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:38.205
Um, well, it'll have to be,

675
00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:40.525
I mean, it'll be after this fall.

676
00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.845
Correct. And then they'll arrange for it, you know,

677
00:34:42.845 --> 00:34:45.005
I don't have the exact date they're gonna do the demo,

678
00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:49.285
but it'll be sometime between this fall and next summer.

679
00:34:49.715 --> 00:34:51.405
Okay. That they'll demo that. Sure.

680
00:34:51.595 --> 00:34:55.565
Okay. I, I would love to understand rough timeline

681
00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:57.205
of when we think the lunch pavilion.

682
00:34:57.205 --> 00:34:59.845
I assume we have some sort of timing projection,

683
00:34:59.905 --> 00:35:02.165
so I just didn't see that in here. But if I could get

684
00:35:02.165 --> 00:35:03.125
That, it would be, it would be toward the

685
00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:03.685
end of the project.

686
00:35:04.715 --> 00:35:08.325
Okay. But I would appreciate getting that detail if

687
00:35:08.325 --> 00:35:09.845
that could be followed up with me. Yeah. Thank

688
00:35:09.845 --> 00:35:10.805
You. Definitely lunch pavilion.

689
00:35:11.025 --> 00:35:12.725
Yes. Yeah. For the completion

690
00:35:12.725 --> 00:35:14.645
of the phase one part of Lin L.

691
00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:17.685
Um, and then my last question was on

692
00:35:17.845 --> 00:35:19.005
Emerald, you talked about the solar.

693
00:35:19.295 --> 00:35:22.125
Where will the solar be in Emerald? Will it be on the roofs?

694
00:35:22.235 --> 00:35:23.485
Will it be in the parking lot?

695
00:35:23.865 --> 00:35:26.205
The solar's gonna be in the

696
00:35:27.915 --> 00:35:29.065
north parking lot.

697
00:35:29.855 --> 00:35:31.825
Okay. So not on any of the roofs.

698
00:35:31.995 --> 00:35:33.305
It'll all be parking lot.

699
00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:36.225
Uh, it'll all be in the parking lot. Okay.

700
00:35:38.205 --> 00:35:41.345
At, at one point we thought we might put some on the roof

701
00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:44.045
of the theater, but we found out that

702
00:35:44.045 --> 00:35:47.525
that wasn't needed in order to meet our, uh, our required,

703
00:35:48.025 --> 00:35:50.045
uh, you know, kilowatt hours.

704
00:35:50.075 --> 00:35:51.965
Okay. And so North, the one along Central.

705
00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:54.405
Got it. Well, yes. So I'll be along central.

706
00:35:54.475 --> 00:35:57.085
That parking area. Mm-Hmm. Not the one by Dublin. Correct.

707
00:35:57.085 --> 00:35:59.825
Okay. Okay. That's all my questions. Thank you.

708
00:36:02.765 --> 00:36:05.725
Anything else? No, thank you. I really appreciate it.

709
00:36:05.725 --> 00:36:07.925
It's really helpful to get all these things

710
00:36:07.925 --> 00:36:09.965
and it's really nice to see everything kind of coming

711
00:36:09.965 --> 00:36:12.165
to fruition and, um, moving along.

712
00:36:12.165 --> 00:36:13.365
And now we can hear all the money too.

713
00:36:13.365 --> 00:36:17.245
And so far we're within budget, which is always a good sign.

714
00:36:17.415 --> 00:36:18.565
Thank you. Thank you.

715
00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:21.445
Um, uh, Mr. Hobbs will talk about some money.

716
00:36:22.165 --> 00:36:25.925
'cause I, I know he, that's his favorite thing. Mine too.

717
00:36:25.985 --> 00:36:28.125
But we're, we're a little bit different on this one.

718
00:36:28.325 --> 00:36:31.485
I spend it and he gets it. There you go. Yeah. Thank you.

719
00:36:32.355 --> 00:36:34.245
Good evening, president Pellum, trustee,

720
00:36:34.245 --> 00:36:35.325
superintendent, funk.

721
00:36:35.665 --> 00:36:38.485
Um, so last year in September, we gave you an update on

722
00:36:38.485 --> 00:36:40.365
what additional resources would be available

723
00:36:40.435 --> 00:36:44.205
because of developer fees coming in, um, interest

724
00:36:44.205 --> 00:36:46.765
that was being earned on money that we had on deposit

725
00:36:46.765 --> 00:36:47.765
with the county treasurer.

726
00:36:48.225 --> 00:36:49.845
Um, we're gonna make that an annual thing just

727
00:36:49.845 --> 00:36:51.125
so we have a clear picture of

728
00:36:51.125 --> 00:36:52.565
what resources are available going forward.

729
00:36:53.305 --> 00:36:57.005
So since we made that report last September, we've earned,

730
00:36:57.225 --> 00:37:00.165
uh, brought in about $3.2 million worth

731
00:37:00.165 --> 00:37:03.365
of new developer fees, um, that can be now released

732
00:37:03.425 --> 00:37:05.845
to use towards, um, either existing

733
00:37:05.845 --> 00:37:07.365
or new projects in the district.

734
00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:09.085
In addition to that, um,

735
00:37:09.325 --> 00:37:10.565
interest rates of course have been a little high.

736
00:37:10.585 --> 00:37:13.125
And so the treasurer has actually been paying out a little

737
00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:15.645
better on our, uh, the bond dollars

738
00:37:15.645 --> 00:37:17.085
that are on deposit right now.

739
00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:19.565
And so that accumulated across the bond.

740
00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:21.565
The developer fees, um, comes out

741
00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:23.405
to a little over $6.1 million.

742
00:37:24.025 --> 00:37:26.405
And so that means, um, as Thomas showed at the start

743
00:37:26.405 --> 00:37:27.405
of the presentation, they had,

744
00:37:27.405 --> 00:37:30.605
you have about $1.1 million worth of funds

745
00:37:30.605 --> 00:37:31.965
that were not yet allocated.

746
00:37:32.425 --> 00:37:35.965
We can add to that almost, uh, 9.4 million, um,

747
00:37:35.965 --> 00:37:38.525
that can be allocated towards projects, uh, moving forward.

748
00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:43.405
That's the left column. That's money we have today.

749
00:37:43.555 --> 00:37:44.725
It's sitting in the treasury.

750
00:37:44.825 --> 00:37:47.445
We could spend it tomorrow if the board so chose

751
00:37:48.785 --> 00:37:49.885
on the future side.

752
00:37:50.345 --> 00:37:52.485
Um, this is very much more speculative.

753
00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:54.885
And so we want to give you a sense, though, of

754
00:37:54.885 --> 00:37:58.005
what might be possible in the future based on projects

755
00:37:58.005 --> 00:38:00.445
that we've already done, based on the potential

756
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.525
of a state bond passing in November.

757
00:38:03.145 --> 00:38:06.125
Um, and to give you a really great example of just

758
00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:07.925
how fluid this can be, um,

759
00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:10.045
I'm already gonna break the very first item.

760
00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:13.525
Um, under Frederickson reconstruction, we had applied

761
00:38:13.525 --> 00:38:16.165
for $3.1 million late this afternoon.

762
00:38:16.225 --> 00:38:18.045
We actually learned that that application was

763
00:38:18.245 --> 00:38:19.405
rejected by OPFC.

764
00:38:19.905 --> 00:38:22.525
Um, and so we will not be getting that $3.1 million.

765
00:38:22.985 --> 00:38:24.765
We will be resubmitting an application.

766
00:38:24.775 --> 00:38:27.725
It'll be for a smaller amount, probably around 1.5,

767
00:38:27.745 --> 00:38:28.765
1.6 million.

768
00:38:29.195 --> 00:38:31.405
Unfortunately, that's gonna move us to the bottom

769
00:38:31.425 --> 00:38:34.605
of the list because that's just the way OPSC works.

770
00:38:34.675 --> 00:38:36.285
They reject your application

771
00:38:36.425 --> 00:38:37.925
and if you try again,

772
00:38:37.925 --> 00:38:39.525
you just go straight to the bottom of the list.

773
00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:41.245
So while I had noted that

774
00:38:41.245 --> 00:38:44.765
that 3.1 million would've been within the current Prop 51

775
00:38:44.895 --> 00:38:47.725
money that was actually available, um, I think it's safe

776
00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.965
to assume that we are no longer gonna be getting any more

777
00:38:49.965 --> 00:38:51.245
Prop 51 money.

778
00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:54.725
The good news is the legislature did put Proposition

779
00:38:54.725 --> 00:38:55.885
two on the ballot for November.

780
00:38:55.905 --> 00:38:57.405
That's a $10 billion.

781
00:38:57.705 --> 00:39:00.165
Um, school finance bond, about eight

782
00:39:00.165 --> 00:39:02.765
and a half billion of that will be used for K 12 schools.

783
00:39:02.865 --> 00:39:05.685
The other one and a half billion for community colleges.

784
00:39:06.225 --> 00:39:08.525
If that passes, then those dollars would be available

785
00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:10.005
to fund new construction

786
00:39:10.025 --> 00:39:12.285
and modernization projects at

787
00:39:12.445 --> 00:39:13.885
school districts across the state.

788
00:39:14.475 --> 00:39:15.605
Just to give you a sense of scale,

789
00:39:15.605 --> 00:39:17.685
prop 51 was a $9 billion bond.

790
00:39:17.705 --> 00:39:20.965
So this is a little bit higher than that. Uh, prop 51 bond.

791
00:39:20.965 --> 00:39:23.445
And that obviously did a lot for us as well

792
00:39:23.445 --> 00:39:25.445
as other DI districts across the state.

793
00:39:26.225 --> 00:39:28.525
We have already applied based on phase one

794
00:39:28.525 --> 00:39:32.285
of Emerald High School for $54.7 million worth of, uh,

795
00:39:32.515 --> 00:39:34.885
refunds from, from the state on that project.

796
00:39:35.585 --> 00:39:38.405
Now, the fact that we applied for 54.7 doesn't mean that's

797
00:39:38.405 --> 00:39:40.485
what we're going to get, but that is kind

798
00:39:40.485 --> 00:39:42.725
of the high water potential of what, uh,

799
00:39:42.725 --> 00:39:43.925
we might be entitled to.

800
00:39:44.385 --> 00:39:47.005
Um, at the end of the day, OPSC gets to make that call as to

801
00:39:47.005 --> 00:39:48.005
how much they're gonna fund us.

802
00:39:48.705 --> 00:39:51.485
Um, I know everybody's gonna wanna know when will

803
00:39:51.485 --> 00:39:52.605
we see any money from that?

804
00:39:52.665 --> 00:39:54.325
And the answer is, I have no idea.

805
00:39:54.705 --> 00:39:57.085
Uh, the first thing that has to happen is the bond has

806
00:39:57.085 --> 00:39:58.125
to pass in November.

807
00:39:58.825 --> 00:40:00.685
Um, good news, this state has a pretty good record

808
00:40:00.685 --> 00:40:01.845
passing school bonds.

809
00:40:01.845 --> 00:40:03.285
About 74% of them pass.

810
00:40:03.665 --> 00:40:06.085
So we're in a pretty good place to assume that

811
00:40:06.085 --> 00:40:07.565
that bond may pass.

812
00:40:08.515 --> 00:40:12.125
Once it passes, then we will, the state will have

813
00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:15.525
to sell those bonds and they will then fund projects in the

814
00:40:15.525 --> 00:40:18.365
order in which they were approved as money is available.

815
00:40:18.505 --> 00:40:20.445
So if they've got a billion dollars worth

816
00:40:20.445 --> 00:40:21.485
of approved projects

817
00:40:21.505 --> 00:40:24.805
and they sell a first round of 700 million in bonds,

818
00:40:25.475 --> 00:40:28.045
then 300 million of those projects are going to wait

819
00:40:28.135 --> 00:40:29.325
until the next set

820
00:40:29.325 --> 00:40:31.165
of bonds are sold at some point in the future.

821
00:40:31.795 --> 00:40:34.045
Just like us, the state obviously has a limit on

822
00:40:34.045 --> 00:40:35.125
how much they can actually sell.

823
00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:37.085
They can't just dump $10 billion worth

824
00:40:37.085 --> 00:40:39.125
of bonds onto the market all at once.

825
00:40:39.545 --> 00:40:43.645
Um, so 54.7 million potential in the future.

826
00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:47.725
Um, obviously as other projects get completed,

827
00:40:47.725 --> 00:40:49.445
we'll be continuing to submit, um,

828
00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:50.845
applications for those as well.

829
00:40:50.845 --> 00:40:52.605
But that's kind of the big ticket one right now.

830
00:40:53.265 --> 00:40:55.485
The other thing that's obviously on the horizon is we have

831
00:40:55.485 --> 00:40:59.205
an agreement, uh, with what was SCS is now Land C Homes.

832
00:40:59.585 --> 00:41:01.405
That's a $19 million mitigation

833
00:41:01.405 --> 00:41:02.645
agreement with that developer.

834
00:41:03.105 --> 00:41:04.845
I'm sure we've all driven by, um,

835
00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:06.605
that property over in Tassajara

836
00:41:06.605 --> 00:41:09.325
and seen lots of big equipment moving dirt around.

837
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:12.205
And so, um, we're looking forward to them starting

838
00:41:12.205 --> 00:41:13.445
to pull their purse permits

839
00:41:13.445 --> 00:41:14.565
because that will set the,

840
00:41:14.575 --> 00:41:17.805
start the clock on when they will be, um, paying

841
00:41:17.805 --> 00:41:19.445
to the district that $19 million

842
00:41:19.475 --> 00:41:20.605
that the lowest under their,

843
00:41:20.705 --> 00:41:22.245
um, existing mitigation agreement.

844
00:41:22.465 --> 00:41:25.205
So that is money that will be coming in the clock starts,

845
00:41:25.205 --> 00:41:27.885
like I said, when they pull their first residential permits,

846
00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:29.685
again, you've seen groundwork.

847
00:41:29.685 --> 00:41:32.125
That's not the residential permits yet. That'll come.

848
00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:36.115
If we were to get all of that,

849
00:41:36.255 --> 00:41:37.635
and I already told you we're not,

850
00:41:37.635 --> 00:41:39.675
because we're not getting that whole 3.1 for sure.

851
00:41:40.095 --> 00:41:41.835
Um, we'd be looking at a potential

852
00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:45.275
of another $76 million in change, um, moving forward.

853
00:41:46.945 --> 00:41:49.285
So when we take though that $9 million

854
00:41:49.315 --> 00:41:50.765
that we do have in the bank today,

855
00:41:50.765 --> 00:41:53.165
that's real money really here right now.

856
00:41:53.705 --> 00:41:56.325
Um, and add that back in, you can see that right now we,

857
00:41:56.425 --> 00:42:00.005
the, the board has about $10.5 million worth of funds

858
00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:01.525
that are not currently allocated

859
00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:05.085
to any projects in the facilities, uh, portfolio.

860
00:42:06.195 --> 00:42:07.965
With that, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

861
00:42:12.185 --> 00:42:13.235
Trustee Blackman.

862
00:42:14.255 --> 00:42:16.835
So, uh, you mentioned the new November ballot

863
00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.835
or facilities, but the details of that ballot

864
00:42:21.555 --> 00:42:23.795
actually weigh, um, in favor

865
00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:26.635
of much smaller districts receiving funding

866
00:42:26.775 --> 00:42:29.115
before larger districts

867
00:42:29.115 --> 00:42:31.635
and districts that seem to have well-funded

868
00:42:31.635 --> 00:42:34.715
or higher net worth for all it's worth.

869
00:42:34.975 --> 00:42:39.115
Um, how do you see us applying for funds now?

870
00:42:39.805 --> 00:42:43.715
Presumably the 54.7 million that we're applying for Emerald

871
00:42:44.245 --> 00:42:46.435
comes out of some future state money

872
00:42:46.505 --> 00:42:47.755
that doesn't exist right now,

873
00:42:48.495 --> 00:42:51.955
but let's be realistic, if this bond passes,

874
00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:56.585
what's the chance of Dublin receiving any money at all given

875
00:42:56.605 --> 00:42:58.625
the way that this bond is being structured?

876
00:43:00.095 --> 00:43:01.895
I have no way to calculate an answer to that.

877
00:43:02.575 --> 00:43:04.865
Have we had any discussions with any of the members

878
00:43:05.005 --> 00:43:07.305
who wrote the bond language so that we can understand

879
00:43:07.925 --> 00:43:09.425
if districts like our own,

880
00:43:09.485 --> 00:43:11.225
who are under extreme growth pressure

881
00:43:11.285 --> 00:43:14.185
and had to pay for all these fi funds for facilities,

882
00:43:14.965 --> 00:43:17.985
if there'll be any leeway for those that had growth issues?

883
00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:19.105
Or is it simply going

884
00:43:19.105 --> 00:43:20.945
to be putting all the smaller districts

885
00:43:20.945 --> 00:43:22.065
ahead of the larger ones?

886
00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:24.235
I have not had those conversations.

887
00:43:24.585 --> 00:43:26.755
Okay. I just, it would be great if we could find out a

888
00:43:26.755 --> 00:43:28.755
little bit more because this timeline

889
00:43:28.755 --> 00:43:30.635
for when it may come, maybe never.

890
00:43:32.285 --> 00:43:33.285
Thank you.

891
00:43:33.775 --> 00:43:35.035
We can certainly reach out to some

892
00:43:35.035 --> 00:43:37.235
of our partners in the Coalition for Adequate School Housing

893
00:43:37.335 --> 00:43:39.355
to see if they've got a take on this that might be helpful

894
00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:40.435
and informative for that.

895
00:43:44.605 --> 00:43:46.865
Any other questions? You, you answered mine, which was,

896
00:43:47.075 --> 00:43:49.545
would any of the other projects go, you know, making a,

897
00:43:49.795 --> 00:43:51.625
would be applying for

898
00:43:52.465 --> 00:43:53.705
reimbursement for any of the other projects?

899
00:43:54.325 --> 00:43:56.705
Um, but I think that would be further along the line.

900
00:43:56.705 --> 00:43:58.065
So we really can't count on any

901
00:43:58.065 --> 00:43:59.185
of those dollars at this point in time.

902
00:43:59.965 --> 00:44:02.635
Um, and this is just an information item,

903
00:44:02.865 --> 00:44:03.875
correct? Because I think,

904
00:44:04.625 --> 00:44:06.355
Yeah, so regarding the remaining

905
00:44:06.495 --> 00:44:09.475
or the money in the bank, just over $10 million, uh,

906
00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:13.715
in September, staff will be bringing back a recommendation.

907
00:44:14.295 --> 00:44:17.115
Um, the first thing that we need to address,

908
00:44:17.585 --> 00:44:18.675
address is the fact

909
00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:20.715
that Emerald High School does not have a

910
00:44:20.955 --> 00:44:22.115
softball or baseball field.

911
00:44:22.695 --> 00:44:25.955
Um, I have met with the president of, uh,

912
00:44:26.135 --> 00:44:28.195
Dublin Little League to talk to them about

913
00:44:28.985 --> 00:44:30.355
accessing some of their time.

914
00:44:30.855 --> 00:44:32.965
And I have a meeting with the city tomorrow,

915
00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:34.565
uh, with a proposal.

916
00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:39.885
Um, and so, um, really the goal is gonna be that we,

917
00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:44.085
um, upgrade some of the fields at Emerald Glen Park

918
00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:46.325
that the, uh, district would, uh,

919
00:44:46.325 --> 00:44:49.125
take on if we're guaranteed, uh, time.

920
00:44:49.585 --> 00:44:51.925
And if that does not happen, uh, we can't get

921
00:44:51.925 --> 00:44:55.525
that guarantee, then we will be looking at updating the two

922
00:44:55.525 --> 00:44:59.205
fields, uh, at Dublin High so that we can stack all of the

923
00:44:59.725 --> 00:45:01.285
softball and baseball games, uh,

924
00:45:01.285 --> 00:45:02.845
that can be played into the evening time.

925
00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:05.285
So, uh, we're doing a study on that also.

926
00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:08.685
So that should come hopefully, if not the first,

927
00:45:08.745 --> 00:45:10.805
but definitely the second board meeting in September.

928
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.885
Jesse Buckman, I ask a follow up question.

929
00:45:17.545 --> 00:45:21.205
How much does it cost to build a, as you said,

930
00:45:21.245 --> 00:45:24.645
a softball field or build a baseball diamond

931
00:45:24.675 --> 00:45:27.565
that we would need to support an Emerald team?

932
00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:31.965
How much does that cost in terms of construction and field?

933
00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:35.005
Like if we had to purchase land, what would that cost be?

934
00:45:35.665 --> 00:45:39.165
So, I, I'm not quite sure, uh, let me answer it this way.

935
00:45:39.545 --> 00:45:42.125
Uh, we will have estimates for what it'll cost

936
00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:44.965
to remodel the fields at Dublin High,

937
00:45:45.385 --> 00:45:48.445
and we will have an estimate of what it would get take

938
00:45:48.505 --> 00:45:52.365
to get, uh, the two fields at Emerald Glen ready to go.

939
00:45:52.945 --> 00:45:57.725
Um, but to build a brand new stadium that is, doesn't exist.

940
00:45:58.245 --> 00:45:59.565
I, I don't have that cost soon,

941
00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:00.885
and we won't be looking at doing that.

942
00:46:01.665 --> 00:46:03.725
Uh, I know I would like to see what that number is

943
00:46:03.785 --> 00:46:05.765
for comparison is to why we're putting

944
00:46:05.785 --> 00:46:09.325
so much money into a city facility if we can negotiate

945
00:46:09.325 --> 00:46:11.405
with some other location to basically provide

946
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.565
that site for us.

947
00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:14.965
If that means that we would purchase the land,

948
00:46:14.965 --> 00:46:16.645
whether it's from a new developer, I don't know.

949
00:46:16.905 --> 00:46:18.725
But it gives us something to look at in terms of

950
00:46:18.725 --> 00:46:20.165
what we're investing in the city versus

951
00:46:20.165 --> 00:46:21.165
what we could own on our own.

952
00:46:21.625 --> 00:46:23.725
And I think it's a worthwhile number to have at the meeting.

953
00:46:24.625 --> 00:46:27.005
So, um, if, if the majority

954
00:46:27.005 --> 00:46:28.925
of the board would be interested in that,

955
00:46:29.035 --> 00:46:30.885
that would definitely slow things down.

956
00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:33.085
Um, uh, as I said,

957
00:46:33.085 --> 00:46:35.885
we will present our proposal in September.

958
00:46:36.425 --> 00:46:40.605
We have to keep in mind, uh, that this spring, uh,

959
00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:44.885
Emerald will be, um, having one softball team

960
00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:46.045
and one baseball team,

961
00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:49.805
but the following year they will have two teams each a

962
00:46:49.925 --> 00:46:51.965
varsity and a freshman, uh, team.

963
00:46:52.545 --> 00:46:55.965
Uh, and so the timeline to make decisions really have

964
00:46:55.965 --> 00:46:58.565
to be made in the fall so that by the end

965
00:46:58.585 --> 00:47:01.165
of this school year, if we're doing work,

966
00:47:01.515 --> 00:47:03.565
that work will be ready for the next spring.

967
00:47:04.105 --> 00:47:07.445
Uh, so trying to enter into negotiations, uh,

968
00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:10.125
I just don't see that happening in the next couple months.

969
00:47:10.265 --> 00:47:13.085
Uh, we would have to hire, um, a consultant

970
00:47:13.425 --> 00:47:16.565
to actually reach out to private sectors

971
00:47:16.675 --> 00:47:18.205
that might have land available.

972
00:47:18.645 --> 00:47:21.405
I, I just don't see we can meet that timeline.

973
00:47:21.745 --> 00:47:25.205
So if the goal, if the board wants us to spend time doing

974
00:47:25.205 --> 00:47:27.165
that, um, we can do that.

975
00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:29.340
But I, I highly suggest we do, do not,

976
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.560
it will slow down the process

977
00:47:31.185 --> 00:47:34.845
and we will potentially not have a place for Emerald

978
00:47:34.905 --> 00:47:36.045
to play the following year.

979
00:47:39.185 --> 00:47:41.485
Go ahead, Jessica. So just to be clear,

980
00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:43.125
the reason why we're in this situation is

981
00:47:43.125 --> 00:47:45.525
because the negotiations to use the facilities at

982
00:47:46.065 --> 00:47:48.605
Fallon Sports Park to not go through with the city.

983
00:47:48.705 --> 00:47:51.205
Is that why we're looking at these two other alternatives?

984
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:57.705
I, I will go further back and we're in this situation

985
00:47:57.705 --> 00:48:01.505
because we chose to build a high school on a, a piece

986
00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:04.025
of land that cannot accommodate a comprehensive high school.

987
00:48:04.885 --> 00:48:07.585
And the fallback was to negotiate with the city.

988
00:48:07.725 --> 00:48:09.705
And we've been unsuccessful to date

989
00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:11.105
to negotiate with the city.

990
00:48:12.595 --> 00:48:13.065
Thank you,

991
00:48:19.535 --> 00:48:20.385
trustee quo.

992
00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:24.065
I'm just curious about how are these, um,

993
00:48:25.665 --> 00:48:28.095
these OPSC reimbursements are calculated?

994
00:48:28.095 --> 00:48:32.725
Is it based on school size? Is there formula or is it just,

995
00:48:33.315 --> 00:48:35.205
It's, um, very complicated.

996
00:48:35.355 --> 00:48:37.365
Okay. We hire a, uh, consultant

997
00:48:37.505 --> 00:48:39.485
to do the paperwork and do it for us.

998
00:48:40.165 --> 00:48:43.655
I, I can, I mean, you might as well ask me, you know,

999
00:48:44.205 --> 00:48:46.975
some question about theoretical physics or something.

1000
00:48:47.135 --> 00:48:50.615
I don't know. They have a very complicated part of it is

1001
00:48:50.615 --> 00:48:53.215
that, you know, part of it, which is what we're dealing

1002
00:48:53.215 --> 00:48:56.675
with right now with them, is that, uh, you know,

1003
00:48:56.675 --> 00:48:58.115
they look at capacity too.

1004
00:48:58.575 --> 00:49:00.915
So it not only depends upon your application,

1005
00:49:01.495 --> 00:49:03.755
it depends upon the timing of your application.

1006
00:49:04.335 --> 00:49:07.315
So, like I said, right now, if we have, let's say we have,

1007
00:49:07.895 --> 00:49:11.995
uh, you know, 20 excess classrooms this year,

1008
00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:13.155
if we applied this year

1009
00:49:13.255 --> 00:49:15.155
and they looked at it, they would deny us.

1010
00:49:16.155 --> 00:49:18.895
If we apply three years from now when we don't have excess

1011
00:49:18.895 --> 00:49:21.345
classrooms, they would approve it.

1012
00:49:21.605 --> 00:49:23.665
So it's, a lot of, it's depending upon the circumstances

1013
00:49:23.725 --> 00:49:27.105
you're in and when you apply, not only when you apply,

1014
00:49:27.165 --> 00:49:30.265
but when they actually process your application.

1015
00:49:30.645 --> 00:49:33.585
So we apply now, it could be three years,

1016
00:49:33.765 --> 00:49:34.865
it could be five years

1017
00:49:35.365 --> 00:49:37.905
before they actually review our application

1018
00:49:38.605 --> 00:49:40.625
and they're gonna look at the present circumstances,

1019
00:49:41.085 --> 00:49:43.705
what's going on in your district, everything in order

1020
00:49:43.705 --> 00:49:45.225
for them to make their determination.

1021
00:49:45.965 --> 00:49:48.505
And typically there's no appealing for it.

1022
00:49:48.505 --> 00:49:50.385
Like this one at F Fredrickson that we just had

1023
00:49:50.385 --> 00:49:54.045
for 3.1 million, we appealed it and they came back

1024
00:49:54.045 --> 00:49:58.765
and said, no, but you can apply for, um, uh,

1025
00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.445
modernization money if you like,

1026
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:02.565
but we're not gonna give you any money for new construction.

1027
00:50:03.145 --> 00:50:07.405
So it's really difficult to predict what OPS

1028
00:50:08.185 --> 00:50:09.765
and even SAB is going to do.

1029
00:50:10.315 --> 00:50:14.085
They, they, they, like, we have no idea of knowing

1030
00:50:14.425 --> 00:50:15.965
how many people have applied.

1031
00:50:17.045 --> 00:50:18.085
'cause they don't publish those numbers.

1032
00:50:19.075 --> 00:50:21.725
They only publish the numbers after you're approved.

1033
00:50:22.715 --> 00:50:25.495
So we can see who's been approved for projects.

1034
00:50:25.835 --> 00:50:28.045
We can't see who's applied for projects.

1035
00:50:28.385 --> 00:50:29.565
So it's very opaque.

1036
00:50:29.865 --> 00:50:32.085
Um, really difficult to, to,

1037
00:50:32.185 --> 00:50:34.885
to really look forward in the future

1038
00:50:35.025 --> 00:50:38.965
and make any r you know, very comp like any

1039
00:50:39.105 --> 00:50:40.285
for sure statements of

1040
00:50:40.285 --> 00:50:41.965
what they're gonna do three years from now

1041
00:50:42.465 --> 00:50:44.445
or four years from now when they actually get

1042
00:50:44.445 --> 00:50:45.845
around the looking at our application.

1043
00:50:45.985 --> 00:50:49.595
It could be that long. Thank you.

1044
00:50:53.615 --> 00:50:58.335
All righty. I think that's, that's it for this one.

1045
00:50:58.335 --> 00:50:59.975
This is not an action item. So Alrightyy

1046
00:50:59.975 --> 00:51:02.015
and we didn't have any, no public comment.

1047
00:51:03.235 --> 00:51:07.525
All right. Now I have an enrollment update. Um,

1048
00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:10.945
Yes, Dr. Campbell will introduce this one, please.

1049
00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:14.655
Thank you. Superintendent Funk, president Pelham

1050
00:51:14.655 --> 00:51:17.335
and board of trustees and members of the community.

1051
00:51:17.515 --> 00:51:20.455
Uh, last year, this time, this meeting,

1052
00:51:21.155 --> 00:51:22.575
Curtis Har got in front of you

1053
00:51:22.675 --> 00:51:25.415
to give a TKK enrollment update.

1054
00:51:25.435 --> 00:51:27.935
And that was on the request of the board.

1055
00:51:28.475 --> 00:51:32.735
And this year it, uh, we have expanded the, the presentation

1056
00:51:32.995 --> 00:51:34.695
and the information in front of you.

1057
00:51:35.315 --> 00:51:38.615
So our director of TK 12 programs is here

1058
00:51:38.715 --> 00:51:40.615
to give an update on enrollment,

1059
00:51:40.615 --> 00:51:41.815
what enrollment looks like in the district.

1060
00:51:49.415 --> 00:51:51.685
Thank you, Dr. Campbell. Good evening, president Pellum,

1061
00:51:51.685 --> 00:51:53.565
superintendent Funk, board of trustees

1062
00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:55.405
and members of executive cabinet.

1063
00:51:55.885 --> 00:51:57.965
I do not have a slide deck to share with you,

1064
00:51:58.105 --> 00:52:00.445
but I will give some highlights

1065
00:52:00.465 --> 00:52:02.925
or overview of the board report

1066
00:52:03.065 --> 00:52:05.885
and some things, uh, just that stood out, uh,

1067
00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:08.405
while the numbers were being, uh, looked at.

1068
00:52:08.745 --> 00:52:10.325
Um, and then I will be more than happy

1069
00:52:10.385 --> 00:52:11.885
to answer questions after.

1070
00:52:12.545 --> 00:52:15.685
So just to acclimate you to the report, the first six pages

1071
00:52:15.865 --> 00:52:19.205
and the beginning of page seven is our site enrollment data

1072
00:52:19.785 --> 00:52:22.045
as of August 19th of this school year.

1073
00:52:22.545 --> 00:52:25.365
Uh, it has the projected numbers, uh, that were given

1074
00:52:25.365 --> 00:52:28.485
to us in our most recent demographer report, as well

1075
00:52:28.585 --> 00:52:31.245
as our actual student enrollment numbers.

1076
00:52:31.745 --> 00:52:36.565
Uh, on that date. In the, in that section of the report,

1077
00:52:36.665 --> 00:52:39.485
you will see at the bottom of each one seats remaining.

1078
00:52:39.905 --> 00:52:42.645
Uh, the seats remaining is based upon the contractual

1079
00:52:42.645 --> 00:52:46.445
staffing ratio for grades TK through five.

1080
00:52:47.105 --> 00:52:49.445
And for the middle schools grades six through eight.

1081
00:52:49.675 --> 00:52:52.925
It's based on the number of science sections times 33

1082
00:52:53.165 --> 00:52:55.725
students to determine, uh, where we have space.

1083
00:52:56.355 --> 00:52:59.685
That information is primarily used for us as it relates to

1084
00:53:00.705 --> 00:53:03.605
any transfer requests that we get, either intra

1085
00:53:03.865 --> 00:53:07.485
or inter-district transfers, as well as helping us

1086
00:53:07.485 --> 00:53:09.685
to make decisions when it comes to whether

1087
00:53:09.705 --> 00:53:12.885
or not to divert students from one site to another site.

1088
00:53:14.145 --> 00:53:15.205
The word impacted

1089
00:53:15.265 --> 00:53:18.565
that's used here is based upon a staffing allocation.

1090
00:53:18.985 --> 00:53:23.205
It is not always based upon facility space. Okay.

1091
00:53:23.305 --> 00:53:26.205
So we have some sites that have classrooms

1092
00:53:26.205 --> 00:53:28.405
that aren't being used that are saying

1093
00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.605
that there are grade levels that are impacted.

1094
00:53:30.875 --> 00:53:33.845
It's just because of how we are staffed at those sites.

1095
00:53:34.585 --> 00:53:37.085
So at the elementary level, the sites

1096
00:53:37.155 --> 00:53:40.485
that have a significant impact are Amador Elementary,

1097
00:53:40.615 --> 00:53:44.485
which has impacted all grade levels except for first,

1098
00:53:44.865 --> 00:53:46.125
second, and fifth.

1099
00:53:47.345 --> 00:53:51.165
Dublin Elementary School in Doherty Elementary School, uh,

1100
00:53:51.165 --> 00:53:53.045
are impacted in three of the grade levels.

1101
00:53:53.475 --> 00:53:55.045
Both of those are kindergarten,

1102
00:53:55.095 --> 00:53:56.365
first grade, and fourth grade.

1103
00:53:57.305 --> 00:53:59.805
And then, um, for specific grade levels,

1104
00:54:00.815 --> 00:54:05.205
first grade is impacted, um, in the Fallon feeder area.

1105
00:54:05.585 --> 00:54:10.245
So those schools that are east of, uh, of Doherty Road, um,

1106
00:54:10.385 --> 00:54:13.565
all but one of the schools is impacted in first grade

1107
00:54:14.385 --> 00:54:17.325
and then third grade in all of the school, in two

1108
00:54:17.425 --> 00:54:21.725
of the three schools that all west of Doherty Road,

1109
00:54:22.185 --> 00:54:25.045
so Amador and Dublin Amador in first grade

1110
00:54:25.045 --> 00:54:26.805
and Dublin Elementary and third grade.

1111
00:54:26.985 --> 00:54:30.165
And those prospective regions are the only school sites

1112
00:54:30.165 --> 00:54:32.485
that have space remaining in those grade levels.

1113
00:54:33.225 --> 00:54:35.165
So you may have seen in the Dublin l section,

1114
00:54:35.185 --> 00:54:37.885
if you looked at the number of diversions, a lot

1115
00:54:37.885 --> 00:54:40.845
of diversions into Dublin Elementary School.

1116
00:54:40.985 --> 00:54:43.485
And that was primarily because of third grade

1117
00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:48.165
and then siblings of third graders, uh, in order to, uh,

1118
00:54:48.185 --> 00:54:50.565
to have space at those sites, uh,

1119
00:54:50.565 --> 00:54:53.645
because we were so impacted at in West Dublin schools in in

1120
00:54:53.645 --> 00:54:58.175
that grade level, um, middle school, uh, on pages five

1121
00:54:58.175 --> 00:55:00.535
and six, I wanted to just point out

1122
00:55:00.535 --> 00:55:01.855
that Fallon Middle School,

1123
00:55:02.805 --> 00:55:06.255
despite the science sections times 33, which may show

1124
00:55:06.255 --> 00:55:07.855
that there are some seats, you can see

1125
00:55:07.855 --> 00:55:10.735
that these seats remaining all are reflected at zero.

1126
00:55:11.235 --> 00:55:14.255
And that is due to the demographer capacity number,

1127
00:55:14.995 --> 00:55:16.375
um, being exceeded.

1128
00:55:16.835 --> 00:55:19.815
And so since that demographer capacity number has exceeded,

1129
00:55:20.245 --> 00:55:21.695
essentially no inter

1130
00:55:21.835 --> 00:55:25.455
or intra district transfers were approved for Fallon,

1131
00:55:25.475 --> 00:55:28.455
unless the students were already in their numbers, um,

1132
00:55:28.595 --> 00:55:30.575
at the time of the transfer request.

1133
00:55:31.635 --> 00:55:33.575
And then you can see at Wells Middle School,

1134
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:36.495
grade seven is very close to being impacted as well.

1135
00:55:38.185 --> 00:55:41.165
Uh, speaking of, and now I'm gonna focus in on projections.

1136
00:55:41.665 --> 00:55:45.885
Um, projections at the, um, elementary level in grades first

1137
00:55:45.885 --> 00:55:47.765
through fifth grade, were all pretty close.

1138
00:55:48.465 --> 00:55:50.445
All of the grade levels were within 10

1139
00:55:50.585 --> 00:55:52.125
of the projection except

1140
00:55:52.145 --> 00:55:55.205
for fourth grade in which we had 26 more

1141
00:55:55.445 --> 00:55:56.525
students than projected.

1142
00:55:57.315 --> 00:56:00.965
However, if you look on page eight at the TK

1143
00:56:00.965 --> 00:56:03.525
and K numbers, you can see

1144
00:56:03.525 --> 00:56:06.805
that we are significantly under projection

1145
00:56:06.865 --> 00:56:07.965
in those two grade levels.

1146
00:56:08.745 --> 00:56:12.365
TK is about one classroom short of our projection 24 under,

1147
00:56:12.985 --> 00:56:17.245
but kindergarten we were 118 students below projection.

1148
00:56:17.745 --> 00:56:21.085
So that did impact, um, our staffing, uh,

1149
00:56:21.105 --> 00:56:22.445
as it related to that.

1150
00:56:24.095 --> 00:56:27.115
Uh, page seven in the report, uh,

1151
00:56:27.145 --> 00:56:29.995
just gives you some information on our transfers.

1152
00:56:30.375 --> 00:56:33.675
So the number of intra district transfers that we approved

1153
00:56:33.775 --> 00:56:36.395
and how many we denied, uh, just to,

1154
00:56:36.895 --> 00:56:39.795
to let the board know all to denials of

1155
00:56:40.395 --> 00:56:44.475
transfers either intra or enter are all based upon space.

1156
00:56:44.665 --> 00:56:47.035
That is the only deciding factors as to whether

1157
00:56:47.055 --> 00:56:50.515
or not we approve or deny is based on space at the site.

1158
00:56:51.415 --> 00:56:54.795
You can see, um, in the inter-district where our students

1159
00:56:54.825 --> 00:56:57.635
that are coming in the top three districts that, um,

1160
00:56:57.635 --> 00:56:59.315
have students that are coming into us.

1161
00:56:59.855 --> 00:57:02.715
And then you can also see in that, um, bottom area

1162
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:05.315
the inter districts out of Dublin

1163
00:57:05.495 --> 00:57:07.515
and the top three school districts

1164
00:57:07.515 --> 00:57:11.075
that students are going out, um, to other school districts.

1165
00:57:12.515 --> 00:57:15.555
I wanted to spend a little bit of time focusing in on page

1166
00:57:15.685 --> 00:57:20.395
eight, which is the tk, um, and kindergarten numbers.

1167
00:57:22.925 --> 00:57:27.705
So in previous board reports talked about TK expanding

1168
00:57:27.795 --> 00:57:31.225
every year, two months, um, two additional months

1169
00:57:31.315 --> 00:57:33.465
until we reach the full implementation year

1170
00:57:33.465 --> 00:57:35.065
of all four year olds in tk.

1171
00:57:36.295 --> 00:57:39.465
Next year we'll be that full implementation year.

1172
00:57:40.005 --> 00:57:43.865
So you can see in the 25 26 line a significant

1173
00:57:44.505 --> 00:57:47.305
increase in the projection numbers from where our actuals

1174
00:57:47.305 --> 00:57:49.345
or projections were this year, um,

1175
00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:53.425
by about 150 students more next year in tk.

1176
00:57:54.565 --> 00:57:57.825
The main reason that next year shows so much more is

1177
00:57:57.825 --> 00:58:00.465
that we are actually adding three months as opposed

1178
00:58:00.485 --> 00:58:02.785
to the two months that we have been adding previously

1179
00:58:03.165 --> 00:58:04.865
to capture all of the summer months.

1180
00:58:05.775 --> 00:58:08.345
It's also the way that the ed code reads also means

1181
00:58:08.345 --> 00:58:12.665
that students who turn four by, um, the deadline, uh,

1182
00:58:12.985 --> 00:58:15.825
September 1st, that uh, birth dates can start school,

1183
00:58:16.115 --> 00:58:19.225
which means that we will have some three year olds in TK

1184
00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:22.665
next school year, um, the older three year olds by a couple

1185
00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.145
of weeks until they turn four.

1186
00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:29.105
Um, so this year, um,

1187
00:58:29.125 --> 00:58:31.505
we had ended up in tk in kindergarten classes

1188
00:58:32.065 --> 00:58:35.425
combined we had 45 classes with 50 classes

1189
00:58:35.575 --> 00:58:37.185
that were originally projected.

1190
00:58:38.495 --> 00:58:43.265
Next year, we are projected to have 54 classes this year,

1191
00:58:43.265 --> 00:58:45.585
45, so that if our projections hold true,

1192
00:58:45.585 --> 00:58:47.145
that would be an increase next year

1193
00:58:47.605 --> 00:58:49.905
for tk in kindergarten of nine classes.

1194
00:58:50.725 --> 00:58:52.905
Um, it may actually be more than nine classes

1195
00:58:53.345 --> 00:58:56.465
'cause I factored that in at the 20, at the 12 to one ratio.

1196
00:58:57.005 --> 00:59:00.945
But next year another wrinkle for TK is that the adult

1197
00:59:00.945 --> 00:59:05.105
to student ratio decreases from 12 students to one adult,

1198
00:59:05.105 --> 00:59:06.665
to 10 students to one adult.

1199
00:59:07.365 --> 00:59:12.225
Um, so I think that pretty much covers, uh,

1200
00:59:12.225 --> 00:59:15.265
just some of the overviews in some areas that I just wanted

1201
00:59:15.265 --> 00:59:17.265
to make the bring to the board's attention.

1202
00:59:17.805 --> 00:59:19.505
Um, and at this time I'm more than happy

1203
00:59:19.505 --> 00:59:21.605
to answer any questions that you may have.

1204
00:59:22.995 --> 00:59:24.845
Trustee Speck and then Trustee Blackman,

1205
00:59:25.575 --> 00:59:26.645
thank you for the report.

1206
00:59:27.145 --> 00:59:31.675
Um, I have a few questions, um, on the kindergarten,

1207
00:59:32.015 --> 00:59:35.475
so it's, you know, about 120 off the projection.

1208
00:59:35.575 --> 00:59:38.595
Do we have any idea where those kids go?

1209
00:59:38.795 --> 00:59:41.035
I know that, you know, he has pretty good science

1210
00:59:41.135 --> 00:59:44.315
around making that as far as they actually, you know,

1211
00:59:44.315 --> 00:59:45.635
this wasn't like projecting birth.

1212
00:59:45.635 --> 00:59:46.675
These were kids who were born

1213
00:59:46.675 --> 00:59:47.835
and they were just, you know, four.

1214
00:59:48.415 --> 00:59:50.235
Um, do we know if they went private?

1215
00:59:50.615 --> 00:59:53.555
Are they part of that big San Ramon number? Like what?

1216
00:59:53.855 --> 00:59:54.855
Do we have any idea?

1217
00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.795
It's a good question. Uh, I don't know, Chris,

1218
00:59:57.815 --> 00:59:59.835
if you have any insight in regards

1219
00:59:59.835 --> 01:00:02.595
to kindergarten projections as it relates

1220
01:00:02.655 --> 01:00:04.435
to the demographer reports

1221
01:00:05.095 --> 01:00:08.255
and that number being off by

1222
01:00:08.315 --> 01:00:09.735
so much compared to other grade levels?

1223
01:00:10.505 --> 01:00:12.185
Kindergarten is without a doubt,

1224
01:00:12.185 --> 01:00:14.385
the most challenging grade level to predict, you know,

1225
01:00:14.385 --> 01:00:17.185
the best data that we have feeding into that model is

1226
01:00:17.485 --> 01:00:20.185
how many, uh, kids were born five years ago

1227
01:00:20.995 --> 01:00:22.935
and things change in five years.

1228
01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.215
And obviously we've seen a lot

1229
01:00:24.215 --> 01:00:25.575
of change over the last five years.

1230
01:00:25.675 --> 01:00:28.935
So that's, like I said, that's kind of the best data point.

1231
01:00:29.195 --> 01:00:30.655
Um, and it's not a great one,

1232
01:00:31.115 --> 01:00:32.735
so I think it's getting a little tighter,

1233
01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:35.095
but it's definitely a, an area that we continue to look at.

1234
01:00:35.555 --> 01:00:36.895
So he doesn't actually have a way,

1235
01:00:36.895 --> 01:00:38.335
or the d doesn't have a way to

1236
01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:41.015
actually know 4-year-old other than if they were our TK

1237
01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:42.855
students that are living in the area.

1238
01:00:43.045 --> 01:00:45.375
They are doing it off of five yearold birth rates,

1239
01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:49.215
and we've grown a lot and we had a pandemic and okay's.

1240
01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:50.255
Exactly right. So that would be big effect. All right.

1241
01:00:50.755 --> 01:00:54.695
Um, I noticed a lot of students are leaving our district

1242
01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:55.775
and going to San Ramon.

1243
01:00:56.315 --> 01:00:59.375
Um, can you, is

1244
01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:02.135
that across our K through 12?

1245
01:01:02.355 --> 01:01:05.135
Do we see it concentrated at a certain grade,

1246
01:01:05.135 --> 01:01:07.215
like high school or middle school or elementary,

1247
01:01:07.555 --> 01:01:10.175
or do we see it even swath? What, what's,

1248
01:01:10.935 --> 01:01:14.975
I would have to look a little more deeply at the data from

1249
01:01:15.325 --> 01:01:16.735
what, from the approvals

1250
01:01:16.765 --> 01:01:19.095
that I have done over the course of this summer.

1251
01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:23.095
It seems to run the gamut as far as inter-district transfers

1252
01:01:23.095 --> 01:01:24.655
regarding the age of students.

1253
01:01:25.195 --> 01:01:27.855
But I haven't dove, dove in deep enough,

1254
01:01:29.645 --> 01:01:30.975
dove I think is the right word, uh,

1255
01:01:30.975 --> 01:01:33.975
and deep enough to the data to be able to look

1256
01:01:33.975 --> 01:01:35.415
for any trends that that might be.

1257
01:01:35.415 --> 01:01:37.655
So I'm more than happy to, uh, to look

1258
01:01:37.675 --> 01:01:41.775
to see if there are some specific trends based upon grade

1259
01:01:41.825 --> 01:01:45.815
level, um, span or age that may lead to transfers to

1260
01:01:45.925 --> 01:01:46.925
Outside of our district. Yeah, I'm,

1261
01:01:46.925 --> 01:01:47.735
I'm hoping that you

1262
01:01:47.735 --> 01:01:48.935
see it at a high school level.

1263
01:01:49.355 --> 01:01:51.295
And we had a very crowded high school and,

1264
01:01:51.395 --> 01:01:53.855
and that maybe that would start to decrease

1265
01:01:54.035 --> 01:01:57.375
as we have more capacity level is just, just a one thought.

1266
01:01:57.475 --> 01:01:59.975
But, um, obviously that's a lot of kids that are,

1267
01:01:59.975 --> 01:02:01.135
are leaving our district.

1268
01:02:01.795 --> 01:02:04.255
Um, and while we were in that massive growth

1269
01:02:04.435 --> 01:02:06.415
and so overcrowded at so many schools,

1270
01:02:06.915 --> 01:02:08.295
it wasn't as big a deal.

1271
01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:10.095
But we, we have space now for them

1272
01:02:10.155 --> 01:02:12.295
and so we don't, we don't want them to leave Dublin.

1273
01:02:12.425 --> 01:02:16.945
Right. Um, uh, you talked about diversions,

1274
01:02:17.445 --> 01:02:21.045
um, and you gave the example, uh, third grade at Dublin l

1275
01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:25.165
if, um, I moved to town and I live in the Murray district

1276
01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:26.885
and there's not space, so I get diverted

1277
01:02:26.885 --> 01:02:28.765
to Dublin l third grade and I love it.

1278
01:02:29.465 --> 01:02:31.605
Do I get to go there for fourth and fifth

1279
01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:33.085
or am I popped back to Murray at

1280
01:02:33.085 --> 01:02:34.165
the end of the summer? Sure.

1281
01:02:34.225 --> 01:02:35.565
So what we do for students

1282
01:02:35.565 --> 01:02:39.965
who are diverted is once a space opens up at the, uh, school

1283
01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:42.205
of residence, the school would call that family

1284
01:02:42.305 --> 01:02:44.165
and let them know that there is a space available

1285
01:02:44.825 --> 01:02:47.005
if the family chooses at that point in time

1286
01:02:47.065 --> 01:02:50.085
to remain at the site that they're at, um,

1287
01:02:50.185 --> 01:02:53.965
we actually do a internal intra district transfer for

1288
01:02:53.965 --> 01:02:57.285
that student to approve that student to remain at

1289
01:02:57.285 --> 01:02:59.245
that school, which then becomes their new school

1290
01:02:59.245 --> 01:03:01.645
of residents until the end of that grade band.

1291
01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:04.845
So if it's a third grader in the example you gave

1292
01:03:05.265 --> 01:03:08.005
and they wanted to remain at Dublin Elementary School,

1293
01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:09.725
they could remain there until fifth grade,

1294
01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:13.725
but then once middle school hits, then it, it would,

1295
01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:15.525
they would kind of go back into their,

1296
01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.405
what their regular school of residence is.

1297
01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:20.045
Okay. This, this came up, I think, in some questions

1298
01:03:20.045 --> 01:03:24.285
that you had sent in regards to specifically in the area

1299
01:03:24.435 --> 01:03:26.285
that is zoned for Shamrock Hills,

1300
01:03:26.615 --> 01:03:28.285
where we have some students who,

1301
01:03:28.795 --> 01:03:32.205
because they're closer in, um, distance to Dougherty,

1302
01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:33.685
but they were zoned for Murray

1303
01:03:34.115 --> 01:03:37.725
that they did an intra district transfer into Doherty.

1304
01:03:37.995 --> 01:03:41.205
Once they get to fifth grade, if they're zoned for wells,

1305
01:03:41.475 --> 01:03:43.445
then they would go into Wells's number.

1306
01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.845
If they're zoned where they live for Fallon,

1307
01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:47.685
then Fallon would be their school of residence.

1308
01:03:47.705 --> 01:03:50.605
So it's, it, it kind of all starts over regardless of

1309
01:03:50.605 --> 01:03:53.125
that intra at the end of fifth grade,

1310
01:03:53.745 --> 01:03:55.125
eighth grade, and eighth grade.

1311
01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:56.765
Okay. With the exception of Cottonwood Creek.

1312
01:03:56.765 --> 01:03:58.925
Cottonwood Creeks are good all the way through eighth grade.

1313
01:03:59.715 --> 01:04:01.485
Okay. Um, and then Shamrock Hills,

1314
01:04:01.645 --> 01:04:02.645
I guess would be the same way in two

1315
01:04:02.645 --> 01:04:03.645
Years. Shamrock Hills will be all

1316
01:04:03.645 --> 01:04:04.485
the way through eighth grade

1317
01:04:04.765 --> 01:04:07.445
'cause it's the last grade at the school that you are at.

1318
01:04:07.465 --> 01:04:08.765
And then it, the process starts over

1319
01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:09.765
Again. And since they're outta school

1320
01:04:09.765 --> 01:04:11.165
that had space for them

1321
01:04:11.225 --> 01:04:13.685
and we're approving these based on space, if they want

1322
01:04:13.685 --> 01:04:15.365
to stay at the school they were diverted to,

1323
01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:16.805
we would always approve those.

1324
01:04:16.805 --> 01:04:18.685
Right. Because there's space for them. That is correct.

1325
01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:21.845
Okay. Um, uh, seventh grade,

1326
01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:24.805
what happens if another student goes to Wells

1327
01:04:25.545 --> 01:04:27.085
and then seventh grade is full?

1328
01:04:27.425 --> 01:04:29.645
Do they have to go all the way over to Cottonwood,

1329
01:04:29.645 --> 01:04:31.405
which looks like the only school with seventh grade

1330
01:04:31.725 --> 01:04:32.725
Capacity? Yeah, so it gets

1331
01:04:32.725 --> 01:04:33.685
a little bit tricky when you

1332
01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:34.765
get to the second grade level.

1333
01:04:35.025 --> 01:04:39.045
Um, we primarily use these numbers for determining whether

1334
01:04:39.045 --> 01:04:41.245
or not to approve, approve any inter

1335
01:04:41.465 --> 01:04:43.965
or intra district transfers into that grade level

1336
01:04:44.635 --> 01:04:47.765
when it comes to students that live in that area

1337
01:04:47.785 --> 01:04:49.125
of residence, because we know

1338
01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:51.645
that our middle schools are spaced out, um,

1339
01:04:51.645 --> 01:04:55.045
what we essentially do is we ask the school, um, based upon

1340
01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:57.805
what courses of study that the student needs,

1341
01:04:58.225 --> 01:05:01.165
can you build reasonably build a schedule for that student

1342
01:05:01.345 --> 01:05:03.205
to remain at their school of residence?

1343
01:05:03.465 --> 01:05:06.965
If the answer is yes, then we go ahead and just enroll them.

1344
01:05:07.345 --> 01:05:09.725
If the answer is no, we can't build a schedule for

1345
01:05:09.725 --> 01:05:12.565
that student because they need this specific math course

1346
01:05:13.025 --> 01:05:16.205
and it's highly impacted, then yes, at that point we would,

1347
01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.885
we would, would do an in, we would do a, um,

1348
01:05:18.995 --> 01:05:21.125
diversion in this case to Cottonwood Creek.

1349
01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:23.565
Okay. So we'll try everything we can Correct.

1350
01:05:23.625 --> 01:05:25.405
But at some point there would hit a ceiling

1351
01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:26.625
At secondary schools. Yes.

1352
01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:29.005
At the elementary level, we try to stay within region.

1353
01:05:29.195 --> 01:05:32.565
Yeah. Um, we have a little bit of wiggle room with the going

1354
01:05:32.655 --> 01:05:35.845
above the staffing ratio, um, per our contract

1355
01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.685
to go one student or two students over,

1356
01:05:37.735 --> 01:05:39.165
which we have done in some

1357
01:05:39.165 --> 01:05:40.925
of our grade levels at the elementary level,

1358
01:05:41.335 --> 01:05:43.245
it'll still show a zero seats remaining,

1359
01:05:43.265 --> 01:05:46.565
but some of our sites do have space for any students

1360
01:05:46.565 --> 01:05:49.325
that move into the area, just not space for any transfers.

1361
01:05:49.555 --> 01:05:50.645
Okay. Um,

1362
01:05:50.645 --> 01:05:52.125
and then my last question was on the high school,

1363
01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.965
there was no, um, row for seats remaining.

1364
01:05:54.965 --> 01:05:57.485
Does that just mean we have plenty of extra space

1365
01:05:57.665 --> 01:05:59.365
for each of the grades for those

1366
01:05:59.475 --> 01:06:00.475
Schools? Uh, it's

1367
01:06:00.475 --> 01:06:03.685
both, both schools, uh, at this point in time, um,

1368
01:06:03.795 --> 01:06:05.845
have, have space.

1369
01:06:06.175 --> 01:06:08.165
Again, it goes back to the, can you build a schedule.

1370
01:06:08.825 --> 01:06:12.005
Uh, we will need to build out something similar to

1371
01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:14.325
what we do at the middle school level,

1372
01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:18.485
likely like ninth grade health, uh, 10th grade, uh,

1373
01:06:18.485 --> 01:06:21.525
world history, something like that to build that base off of

1374
01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.285
for us to make those determinations.

1375
01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:26.925
But at this point, the direction to the high schools are,

1376
01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:28.285
can you build a schedule for a student?

1377
01:06:28.425 --> 01:06:29.925
If so, then they go ahead and stay there.

1378
01:06:29.925 --> 01:06:32.165
And at this point there have been no issues. Okay.

1379
01:06:32.335 --> 01:06:37.075
Great. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation.

1380
01:06:37.115 --> 01:06:39.995
I found it very helpful. I wanted to piggyback on something

1381
01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:42.315
that, uh, trustee Spec had mentioned

1382
01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:43.835
about the loss of students.

1383
01:06:44.615 --> 01:06:47.075
If we look at the value of 167 students,

1384
01:06:47.075 --> 01:06:49.355
that's about $2.5 million

1385
01:06:49.615 --> 01:06:51.395
and we need every million dollars we have.

1386
01:06:51.415 --> 01:06:53.315
So I know it may not seem like a priority,

1387
01:06:53.315 --> 01:06:54.995
but finding out exactly why they left

1388
01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:57.835
and what we can do to change the situation so

1389
01:06:57.835 --> 01:06:59.315
that they come back, I think should be one

1390
01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.875
of the highest priorities we have right now.

1391
01:07:01.505 --> 01:07:03.195
Budgets being what they are chasing,

1392
01:07:03.205 --> 01:07:04.675
every million dollars is worth it.

1393
01:07:05.095 --> 01:07:07.675
So that's the first comment. And one other comment I wanna

1394
01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:09.275
have is you're looking at, um,

1395
01:07:09.595 --> 01:07:10.995
capacity in seats in some of the schools.

1396
01:07:11.015 --> 01:07:12.355
And I appreciate the questions

1397
01:07:12.355 --> 01:07:14.995
that Trustee Spec had asked about some of the issues

1398
01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:16.675
with regard to seventh grade, for example.

1399
01:07:17.015 --> 01:07:18.435
But I'm also looking at some of the trends,

1400
01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:19.555
especially on the east side.

1401
01:07:19.715 --> 01:07:21.995
I know we've had a good break in terms of the number

1402
01:07:21.995 --> 01:07:23.635
of students coming out of eighth grade in terms of

1403
01:07:23.635 --> 01:07:24.635
how many go to Emerald

1404
01:07:24.635 --> 01:07:26.595
and how many go to DHS, which is great

1405
01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:29.555
'cause it's helping to soften serve the impact at Emerald.

1406
01:07:29.815 --> 01:07:31.595
But the numbers coming out of Cottonwood Creek

1407
01:07:31.595 --> 01:07:34.315
and Fallon show a stark difference in terms of

1408
01:07:34.315 --> 01:07:35.915
what we originally designed Emerald for.

1409
01:07:36.295 --> 01:07:37.915
If all of those students show up at Emerald,

1410
01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:40.435
we need a school of 2,800 students and we don't have it.

1411
01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.275
So I would appreciate when we do bring the demographer

1412
01:07:43.275 --> 01:07:45.635
numbers back, that we start to look at the sort of breakup

1413
01:07:45.635 --> 01:07:48.035
of why students choose one school versus another

1414
01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.115
to really begin to understand like

1415
01:07:50.185 --> 01:07:52.635
what we're getting ourselves into in the next couple years

1416
01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:55.835
when we get to full capacity at, at Emerald, I'm psyched

1417
01:07:55.835 --> 01:07:57.355
that we have some space in some of the classes.

1418
01:07:57.795 --> 01:07:59.595
I appreciate the fact that you guys have made lots

1419
01:07:59.595 --> 01:08:02.435
of accommodations for students, but I also am very concerned

1420
01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:03.595
about what this indicates.

1421
01:08:03.755 --> 01:08:06.835
'cause we can look at trends moving across my one comment

1422
01:08:06.895 --> 01:08:07.995
to you about the document.

1423
01:08:08.195 --> 01:08:09.555
I understand now that some

1424
01:08:09.555 --> 01:08:12.275
of the information was not about the physical seats in a

1425
01:08:12.275 --> 01:08:13.435
classroom so much as staff.

1426
01:08:13.915 --> 01:08:14.995
I would've appreciated a little,

1427
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.125
little editorial piece that had been written.

1428
01:08:17.765 --> 01:08:20.045
I actually thought this had to do with classroom capacities

1429
01:08:20.105 --> 01:08:21.485
as opposed to actual numbers.

1430
01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:25.365
I understand that some staff can request additional students

1431
01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:28.165
by contract in their classroom to help ease some

1432
01:08:28.165 --> 01:08:29.245
of the capacity issues we have.

1433
01:08:29.745 --> 01:08:32.325
But is there any way to, to discern for us

1434
01:08:33.015 --> 01:08:34.405
where we actually have the,

1435
01:08:34.405 --> 01:08:36.085
that wiggle room and set these sites?

1436
01:08:36.085 --> 01:08:37.565
When you say that we have, for example,

1437
01:08:38.125 --> 01:08:39.445
I can pull up any one of these right now,

1438
01:08:39.545 --> 01:08:41.085
but let's say Murray Elementary

1439
01:08:41.085 --> 01:08:43.685
and first grade, we have 12 seats remaining.

1440
01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:47.005
Is that 12 seats actually in the real physical classroom

1441
01:08:47.035 --> 01:08:48.125
like that aren't occupied?

1442
01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:51.085
Or those 12 additional seats that we can put in by contract,

1443
01:08:51.225 --> 01:08:52.405
by allowing the teachers

1444
01:08:52.405 --> 01:08:54.165
to accept more students than they're actually

1445
01:08:54.825 --> 01:08:55.885
by contract supposed to have?

1446
01:08:55.885 --> 01:08:57.085
In other words, they get paid more for.

1447
01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:59.405
So I would've, I would've appreciated a little bit more

1448
01:08:59.405 --> 01:09:00.445
detail to explain like,

1449
01:09:00.445 --> 01:09:03.565
this is the extras versus this is our hard baseline of

1450
01:09:03.565 --> 01:09:05.925
what we're at until we ask for the extras.

1451
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:06.975
Thank you.

1452
01:09:18.355 --> 01:09:20.295
All Right. Anything, anyone else? Thank you.

1453
01:09:20.535 --> 01:09:23.295
This is really helpful. Um, kind of knowing and,

1454
01:09:23.515 --> 01:09:25.735
and having looked at demographer numbers for a long time,

1455
01:09:26.015 --> 01:09:28.855
actually seeing hard numbers, um, how many, you know,

1456
01:09:28.855 --> 01:09:29.895
show up in each grade level.

1457
01:09:30.235 --> 01:09:32.775
Um, and they never seem to come in nice packets

1458
01:09:32.775 --> 01:09:34.855
of 24 like we would like them to. So, um,

1459
01:09:34.855 --> 01:09:35.855
Especially Not in tk.

1460
01:09:36.035 --> 01:09:38.735
No. Um, so thank you for that.

1461
01:09:38.815 --> 01:09:39.855
This is, this is helpful

1462
01:09:39.955 --> 01:09:43.495
and I think I assume will be an ongoing yearly, um, report

1463
01:09:43.495 --> 01:09:45.575
and I think it's very helpful for planning and,

1464
01:09:45.575 --> 01:09:47.415
and just getting a sense of where everything is.

1465
01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:49.135
So thank you for all of this.

1466
01:09:51.225 --> 01:09:53.355
Next up we have our public comment period.

1467
01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:55.555
Do we have any, I see some speaker cards over there.

1468
01:09:56.495 --> 01:09:58.795
We do. We have one person here in the room

1469
01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:01.075
and I see one person with their hand raised

1470
01:10:01.075 --> 01:10:02.075
Online. Okay. And if there's

1471
01:10:02.075 --> 01:10:03.715
anyone else online who would like to,

1472
01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:06.235
um, comment during the general public comment period,

1473
01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:09.115
please, um, log on right now once we finish the in-person,

1474
01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:10.475
I'll close off then.

1475
01:10:11.095 --> 01:10:13.675
Um, and just a reminder that, um, you have three minutes,

1476
01:10:14.055 --> 01:10:17.995
um, for your, your comment and that we cannot, um, respond.

1477
01:10:18.335 --> 01:10:19.915
We are listening, staff is listening,

1478
01:10:19.935 --> 01:10:23.995
but, um, we aren't allowed to, um, engage in a dialogue

1479
01:10:23.995 --> 01:10:25.875
during this portion of the meeting.

1480
01:10:25.935 --> 01:10:27.235
So go ahead and call our first speaker.

1481
01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:30.155
Our in-person, speaker is Ram S.

1482
01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:44.185
Can you hear me? Hello? Oh, okay.

1483
01:10:45.045 --> 01:10:47.545
Uh, good evening, board of trustees, uh,

1484
01:10:47.545 --> 01:10:48.625
and Superintendent Funk.

1485
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.945
My name is Ram Hanberg, uh,

1486
01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:53.345
and I'm a father of two kids at Dublin High School.

1487
01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:55.905
We have had a shelter in place

1488
01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.345
and an assault on a student on the Dublin High School

1489
01:10:58.745 --> 01:11:00.425
premises in the span of one week.

1490
01:11:01.585 --> 01:11:04.545
One week. Let that sink in for a moment.

1491
01:11:07.215 --> 01:11:09.175
I do wanna thank you for the notifications

1492
01:11:09.315 --> 01:11:11.855
and the plan outlined to deter such behavior,

1493
01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:13.725
specifically in the case of the assault.

1494
01:11:14.995 --> 01:11:17.015
But that unfortunately is not enough.

1495
01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:20.215
Many in the community have reached out to me

1496
01:11:20.235 --> 01:11:21.455
and shared their concerns,

1497
01:11:21.595 --> 01:11:23.375
and we have had several discussions.

1498
01:11:24.335 --> 01:11:26.055
Students, staff, parents,

1499
01:11:26.275 --> 01:11:28.295
and the community as a whole are anxious

1500
01:11:28.755 --> 01:11:31.135
and worried, as are you.

1501
01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:35.645
I would imagine. I want to acknowledge and thank the coach

1502
01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:38.605
and the members of the football team for stepping in

1503
01:11:38.605 --> 01:11:40.285
and defending and stopping the attack.

1504
01:11:40.785 --> 01:11:42.045
But let's be very clear

1505
01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:44.605
and agree that is not the expectation.

1506
01:11:46.195 --> 01:11:47.975
We cannot afford such incidents

1507
01:11:48.275 --> 01:11:49.575
nor the collateral damage,

1508
01:11:49.685 --> 01:11:51.775
whether it's teachers or students.

1509
01:11:52.995 --> 01:11:56.095
So what specific steps is the board going to take

1510
01:11:56.155 --> 01:12:00.295
to prevent not just ditter, but prevent such behavior

1511
01:12:00.435 --> 01:12:01.695
and attacks in the future?

1512
01:12:02.765 --> 01:12:05.175
What specific actions is the board going to take

1513
01:12:05.395 --> 01:12:08.175
to hold people accountable for these situations

1514
01:12:09.945 --> 01:12:12.255
while student and staff safety is

1515
01:12:12.435 --> 01:12:14.215
and must be our primary concern,

1516
01:12:14.435 --> 01:12:16.015
we cannot ignore the side effects.

1517
01:12:17.055 --> 01:12:19.335
Multiple news outlets are covering these incidents.

1518
01:12:19.925 --> 01:12:22.175
This directly impacts the reputation

1519
01:12:22.175 --> 01:12:23.935
of our flagship high school in Dublin.

1520
01:12:24.355 --> 01:12:28.215
And the city of Dublin itself, DUSD has been one

1521
01:12:28.215 --> 01:12:30.135
of the fastest growing districts in the state.

1522
01:12:30.675 --> 01:12:32.455
And these kinds of issues are going

1523
01:12:32.455 --> 01:12:33.855
to affect our enrollment rates

1524
01:12:34.195 --> 01:12:37.335
and it's only going to get worse if we do not take swift

1525
01:12:37.355 --> 01:12:38.375
and stringent action.

1526
01:12:39.735 --> 01:12:42.735
I strongly urge you to keep an open communication line

1527
01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:44.295
and prevent and sorry,

1528
01:12:44.315 --> 01:12:48.135
and provide frequent updates to ease the anxiousness

1529
01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.735
of the students, the staff, the parents,

1530
01:12:50.915 --> 01:12:52.135
and the community as a whole.

1531
01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:54.255
We are worried. Thank you.

1532
01:12:56.535 --> 01:12:59.485
Thank you. And we have an online Mm-Hmm.

1533
01:12:59.865 --> 01:13:01.205
Go ahead and do that. Okay.

1534
01:13:01.225 --> 01:13:02.725
We have one online speaker. Go ahead.

1535
01:13:10.485 --> 01:13:13.075
Hello, uh, my name is Caroline Martinez.

1536
01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:17.555
I am a newer, uh, uh, parent, uh,

1537
01:13:17.555 --> 01:13:18.715
within this district.

1538
01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:21.035
Um, as we just heard on Friday,

1539
01:13:21.455 --> 01:13:23.675
we had an alarming incident happened at one

1540
01:13:23.675 --> 01:13:25.335
of our schools on Friday.

1541
01:13:25.395 --> 01:13:28.375
We actually had two alarming incidents occur at two

1542
01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:30.775
different schools, uh, here within our district.

1543
01:13:31.675 --> 01:13:35.055
Um, these are critical safety concerns,

1544
01:13:35.275 --> 01:13:37.855
and though no one here can prevent these kind

1545
01:13:37.855 --> 01:13:40.655
of safety concerns, there was an obvious lack

1546
01:13:40.655 --> 01:13:43.815
of communication around, I think the

1547
01:13:44.775 --> 01:13:47.415
response time from the Dublin Police Services team.

1548
01:13:48.155 --> 01:13:51.095
We cannot prevent bad things from happening,

1549
01:13:51.515 --> 01:13:54.255
but we can have protocols in place to ensure

1550
01:13:54.255 --> 01:13:58.015
that when these things do happen, the community is alerted.

1551
01:13:58.235 --> 01:14:01.135
But more importantly, that our kids are kept safe.

1552
01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:06.655
We had a extremely delayed lockdown at an elementary school

1553
01:14:07.085 --> 01:14:10.375
that was directly across, uh,

1554
01:14:10.435 --> 01:14:12.425
the wave from a horrible incident.

1555
01:14:13.505 --> 01:14:15.135
Again, not something we can prevent,

1556
01:14:15.435 --> 01:14:17.855
but the fact that students were being let out of

1557
01:14:17.855 --> 01:14:18.935
that elementary school

1558
01:14:19.225 --> 01:14:22.295
after police were informed of that situation

1559
01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:23.895
seems preposterous.

1560
01:14:25.735 --> 01:14:28.615
I think the board must urgently address these gaps to ensure

1561
01:14:28.615 --> 01:14:32.695
that we have safety for everyone involved, students, staff,

1562
01:14:32.695 --> 01:14:34.175
faculty, um,

1563
01:14:34.315 --> 01:14:36.735
but we need to restore the confidence in our

1564
01:14:36.765 --> 01:14:37.975
emergency protocols.

1565
01:14:38.835 --> 01:14:40.815
And I would like to know what steps will be taken

1566
01:14:40.915 --> 01:14:42.215
to improve communication

1567
01:14:42.435 --> 01:14:45.335
and collaboration with the doubling PD moving forward.

1568
01:14:46.425 --> 01:14:49.045
Um, and I also have a quick, uh,

1569
01:14:49.155 --> 01:14:52.565
comment about the enrollment update that was provided.

1570
01:14:53.345 --> 01:14:55.965
Uh, we w with those numbers

1571
01:14:56.405 --> 01:14:59.965
provided, there seems to be a he highly impacted program

1572
01:15:00.475 --> 01:15:04.405
with, uh, that's SDC students, um, at Dublin High School.

1573
01:15:04.985 --> 01:15:07.365
Um, they are far over the projected numbers

1574
01:15:08.065 --> 01:15:10.325
and I'm wondering what's being, what's going to be done

1575
01:15:10.345 --> 01:15:15.175
to help continue to support that team, um, as they are,

1576
01:15:15.395 --> 01:15:17.775
uh, supporting very delicate, uh,

1577
01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:19.775
students in very delicate situations.

1578
01:15:20.825 --> 01:15:21.825
Thank you.

1579
01:15:24.865 --> 01:15:25.865
That concludes our Public Comment.

1580
01:15:25.865 --> 01:15:26.755
Alright, thank

1581
01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.115
you. Um,

1582
01:15:28.115 --> 01:15:30.995
and then our other one is for a specific item, so we'll,

1583
01:15:30.995 --> 01:15:33.155
we'll call that, um, when we get to that item.

1584
01:15:34.505 --> 01:15:38.005
All righty. And that actually brings us to consent tonight.

1585
01:15:38.825 --> 01:15:42.125
Um, so that is, I wrote it down,

1586
01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.685
GHIJ and K.

1587
01:15:44.745 --> 01:15:47.845
We have a public comment for item H one.

1588
01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:51.805
So I will pull that so that that speaker can pull, can, um,

1589
01:15:52.095 --> 01:15:55.405
speak, um, and then we can vote on it after that.

1590
01:15:55.865 --> 01:15:58.125
Is there any other items that, um, members

1591
01:15:58.125 --> 01:15:59.485
of the board would like to, to pull?

1592
01:15:59.665 --> 01:16:00.805
Um, trustee Blackman,

1593
01:16:01.655 --> 01:16:02.765
Sorry, you're all gonna be mad,

1594
01:16:02.765 --> 01:16:07.645
but G three, G four, H one, H two, H three and J six.

1595
01:16:07.995 --> 01:16:09.645
Okay. I can't write that best.

1596
01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:13.805
Sorry. G three, G four, H one, H two,

1597
01:16:14.205 --> 01:16:16.005
H three J six.

1598
01:16:16.315 --> 01:16:18.405
Some are for real comments and discussions.

1599
01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:20.805
Some are just a request. We'll be quick.

1600
01:16:25.245 --> 01:16:29.365
Okay. Did someone get, okay, so is there

1601
01:16:29.765 --> 01:16:31.285
Anything Yeah, I'll make a motion to approve

1602
01:16:31.745 --> 01:16:32.965
the consent calendar.

1603
01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.845
Minus H one, H two,

1604
01:16:35.205 --> 01:16:38.565
H 3G 3G four and J six.

1605
01:16:38.705 --> 01:16:40.445
Did I get the J one? Right? Um,

1606
01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:43.075
I'll second.

1607
01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:48.285
Okay. Uh, trustee Wanni. Aye. Wanni. Everyone else? Aye.

1608
01:16:48.425 --> 01:16:49.885
Aye, aye. Okay.

1609
01:16:49.985 --> 01:16:51.805
So let, I'm going to start

1610
01:16:51.805 --> 01:16:54.245
with H one since we have a speaker here for that one.

1611
01:16:55.065 --> 01:16:57.525
Um, and then we'll go through the others in order.

1612
01:16:59.535 --> 01:17:00.535
Um, so,

1613
01:17:02.515 --> 01:17:04.975
So the reason why you want, the reason why I pulled it,

1614
01:17:05.595 --> 01:17:08.415
Um, for H one I we're Gonna have a presentation.

1615
01:17:08.745 --> 01:17:12.105
Presentation. No, we just have a, a public, uh,

1616
01:17:12.325 --> 01:17:13.505
public comment on that one.

1617
01:17:13.845 --> 01:17:16.225
So I was gonna let our our public comment speaker speak

1618
01:17:16.225 --> 01:17:18.385
first, and then we can ask questions after that.

1619
01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:21.745
And I see, um, Mr. Wiley is here to answer questions.

1620
01:17:22.245 --> 01:17:26.945
Um, dik sha you wanna come and do your public comment again?

1621
01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:29.185
You'll have three minutes. We'll do the timer.

1622
01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:37.685
Dear Honorable trustees

1623
01:17:37.905 --> 01:17:40.765
and Superintendent Funk, my name is Dik Shaath

1624
01:17:41.265 --> 01:17:44.645
and I could not be more proud to stand before you today.

1625
01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:47.405
Last fall as a junior at Dublin High School,

1626
01:17:47.765 --> 01:17:51.245
I witnessed a unique challenge unfold in our classrooms.

1627
01:17:51.945 --> 01:17:54.405
One that sparked uncertainty, confusion,

1628
01:17:54.585 --> 01:17:57.425
and concern artificial intelligence,

1629
01:17:57.425 --> 01:18:00.745
while only recently capturing headlines has been developing

1630
01:18:00.925 --> 01:18:01.985
for nearly a century,

1631
01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.145
yet its sudden integration into our daily lives

1632
01:18:05.945 --> 01:18:08.705
revealed just how little most of us truly understand it.

1633
01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:11.065
The rapid advancement

1634
01:18:11.065 --> 01:18:13.425
of AI presented schools across the nation

1635
01:18:13.695 --> 01:18:15.345
with unprecedented circumstances.

1636
01:18:16.265 --> 01:18:19.045
In the face of this, it became clear that we needed

1637
01:18:19.045 --> 01:18:20.085
to develop a policy

1638
01:18:20.545 --> 01:18:23.445
to guide its responsible use within our schools.

1639
01:18:24.715 --> 01:18:27.645
Without clear guidelines, the potential for misuse

1640
01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:29.405
and equity and a breakdown

1641
01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.605
of trust in our educational practices

1642
01:18:31.945 --> 01:18:33.045
was too great to ignore.

1643
01:18:34.025 --> 01:18:37.045
We recognized that AI could be both a powerful tool

1644
01:18:37.385 --> 01:18:39.245
and a source of significant challenges,

1645
01:18:39.545 --> 01:18:40.685
if not managed properly.

1646
01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:44.215
The need for a policy wasn't just about regulating a new

1647
01:18:44.215 --> 01:18:46.375
technology, it was about ensuring

1648
01:18:46.565 --> 01:18:50.095
that this tool could enhance learning while safeguarding the

1649
01:18:50.095 --> 01:18:52.575
integrity and ethics of our education system.

1650
01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.785
This board policy is a testament to the resilience,

1651
01:18:57.215 --> 01:19:00.025
flexibility, and innovative spirit of our district.

1652
01:19:00.765 --> 01:19:03.705
In just one year, we have crafted responsible guidelines

1653
01:19:03.855 --> 01:19:05.945
that harness the unlimited potential

1654
01:19:06.365 --> 01:19:09.505
of this rapidly advancing technology while upholding our

1655
01:19:09.665 --> 01:19:12.185
district's core values of morality and safety.

1656
01:19:13.325 --> 01:19:14.945
As the first district in our area

1657
01:19:15.855 --> 01:19:17.715
to take action on this prevalent topic,

1658
01:19:18.215 --> 01:19:20.515
we have truly upheld the USD's mission

1659
01:19:20.775 --> 01:19:23.115
of fostering an equitable and inclusive

1660
01:19:23.495 --> 01:19:25.915
and creative environment where both our students

1661
01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.155
and staff can thrive.

1662
01:19:28.255 --> 01:19:30.475
I'm eternally grateful that our district

1663
01:19:31.075 --> 01:19:32.995
provided its students the opportunity

1664
01:19:33.295 --> 01:19:34.875
to play a pivotal role in the process

1665
01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.115
and to see firsthand what it means

1666
01:19:37.495 --> 01:19:38.955
to support a community that you love.

1667
01:19:39.445 --> 01:19:40.445
Thank you.

1668
01:19:42.935 --> 01:19:45.985
Thank you. You had a question,

1669
01:19:45.985 --> 01:19:47.305
trustee Blackman on this one.

1670
01:19:47.605 --> 01:19:49.905
Um, thank you. I actually have reviewed the policy

1671
01:19:50.045 --> 01:19:51.945
and given that we had back to school night

1672
01:19:52.045 --> 01:19:54.305
and the amount of AI that it seems

1673
01:19:54.305 --> 01:19:55.505
that teachers are incorporating,

1674
01:19:55.505 --> 01:19:57.145
it made me wanna go back and review it.

1675
01:19:57.605 --> 01:20:00.905
So my first, the first question I might have with regard

1676
01:20:00.905 --> 01:20:02.705
to this is, um, I see

1677
01:20:02.705 --> 01:20:04.585
that you've actually incorporated some things,

1678
01:20:04.965 --> 01:20:06.545
but there are also some concerns I have.

1679
01:20:06.545 --> 01:20:08.920
When were, were you expecting to enact this policy?

1680
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.005
If it's approved tonight,

1681
01:20:11.035 --> 01:20:15.775
Um, I would work with, uh, both, uh, Matt, um, Campbell,

1682
01:20:16.235 --> 01:20:17.255
um, Sherry

1683
01:20:17.435 --> 01:20:21.055
and Superintendent Funk to set aside what time we want

1684
01:20:21.055 --> 01:20:22.135
to, uh, enact that.

1685
01:20:23.395 --> 01:20:25.525
Okay. Um, since most of the SLIs

1686
01:20:25.525 --> 01:20:28.525
and everything have already been set, uh, we'd probably be

1687
01:20:29.265 --> 01:20:31.005
at the very earliest, probably looking at

1688
01:20:31.005 --> 01:20:32.045
the second semester.

1689
01:20:32.935 --> 01:20:36.005
Thank you. That helps. And have you had an opportunity

1690
01:20:36.005 --> 01:20:38.205
to send this information out to teachers

1691
01:20:38.225 --> 01:20:40.925
to request their feedback in terms of how,

1692
01:20:41.265 --> 01:20:44.765
if they see things that address what, how they need to use

1693
01:20:45.065 --> 01:20:46.205
or don't use ai?

1694
01:20:46.945 --> 01:20:50.125
Uh, we did have some teachers that were involved in the

1695
01:20:50.635 --> 01:20:51.765
initial part of the committee,

1696
01:20:51.865 --> 01:20:55.605
but they, at the, uh, at the very end

1697
01:20:55.605 --> 01:20:56.885
of the tweaking, they were not.

1698
01:20:57.385 --> 01:21:00.965
Uh, but it has not been sent out to DTA as a whole. So

1699
01:21:01.525 --> 01:21:03.985
Are we planning to do that to get their feedback?

1700
01:21:04.925 --> 01:21:06.425
Um, we could do that, yes.

1701
01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:09.105
No, this is the second reading tonight. Okay.

1702
01:21:09.105 --> 01:21:10.825
So no, then no, we'll bringing it

1703
01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:11.905
forward for a vote tonight.

1704
01:21:12.455 --> 01:21:15.145
Okay. Then I have some comments that I think we need

1705
01:21:15.145 --> 01:21:16.385
to address in the document.

1706
01:21:16.845 --> 01:21:19.665
Um, so there are some teachers

1707
01:21:19.665 --> 01:21:21.425
that are actually utilizing in the,

1708
01:21:21.425 --> 01:21:25.465
their syllabus right now, other ways of using ai.

1709
01:21:25.645 --> 01:21:28.625
And some of the ways that we've annotated in the document

1710
01:21:29.025 --> 01:21:31.385
specifically calls out the way we want

1711
01:21:31.385 --> 01:21:32.545
them to or not want them to.

1712
01:21:32.645 --> 01:21:35.185
And in some cases we actually give them leeway and,

1713
01:21:35.365 --> 01:21:37.865
and use terminology that seems overly subjective,

1714
01:21:38.075 --> 01:21:41.105
where the teacher is able to determine the extent

1715
01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:44.025
to which the student overstepped in their use of ai,

1716
01:21:44.565 --> 01:21:47.185
not really using any parameters to define it very well

1717
01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:48.985
for either the teacher or the student.

1718
01:21:49.325 --> 01:21:50.305
And yet there's also

1719
01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:51.745
information in the back of the document.

1720
01:21:51.775 --> 01:21:54.305
I'll go through each point that doesn't necessarily explain

1721
01:21:54.495 --> 01:21:57.345
what are the steps when we do an investigation

1722
01:21:57.445 --> 01:22:00.465
to enable a student to, basically, it, it talks about

1723
01:22:00.555 --> 01:22:04.505
where we allow them to show how they have used AI

1724
01:22:04.565 --> 01:22:06.985
and that obviously, or not used AI to demonstrate

1725
01:22:06.985 --> 01:22:11.305
that in fact the, um, uh, for lack of better word,

1726
01:22:11.305 --> 01:22:12.825
the accusation being placed on 'em

1727
01:22:12.825 --> 01:22:15.105
for their abusive AI is untrue.

1728
01:22:15.605 --> 01:22:17.785
So they're guilty before their proven innocence.

1729
01:22:17.845 --> 01:22:19.785
So I, I want us to highlight some of this.

1730
01:22:19.805 --> 01:22:21.545
And I do think that students and

1731
01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.705
and teachers alike need more specificity so

1732
01:22:24.705 --> 01:22:26.665
that they can provide very good direction

1733
01:22:26.665 --> 01:22:28.865
to those students if we are gonna roll this out in January,

1734
01:22:29.605 --> 01:22:31.545
so I wanna go through little pieces of it.

1735
01:22:31.645 --> 01:22:32.985
Um, I'm glad you answered that.

1736
01:22:32.985 --> 01:22:33.985
It won't roll out until January.

1737
01:22:34.045 --> 01:22:37.305
So that really, uh, big sigh of relief.

1738
01:22:37.605 --> 01:22:40.745
Um, on the second page under the student category list,

1739
01:22:41.115 --> 01:22:44.065
under this third paragraph, there is a subjective state.

1740
01:22:45.485 --> 01:22:47.505
I'm sorry, I'm at the ar. Okay.

1741
01:22:47.645 --> 01:22:50.305
And I was just, I have one comment on the ai,

1742
01:22:50.305 --> 01:22:51.585
but I'm, I'm on the board policy,

1743
01:22:51.605 --> 01:22:55.265
but the AR talks about it adds a subjective comment about

1744
01:22:55.265 --> 01:22:56.665
15% of their writing

1745
01:22:56.925 --> 01:22:59.305
as it detracts from a student's ability to write eloquently.

1746
01:22:59.425 --> 01:23:00.545
I think the statement about

1747
01:23:00.645 --> 01:23:02.465
how a student writes is subjective

1748
01:23:02.465 --> 01:23:06.125
and should be, um, scratched from the document.

1749
01:23:06.365 --> 01:23:08.685
I don't think we should be describing what we think about

1750
01:23:08.905 --> 01:23:11.405
how AI works for a student or not works for a student.

1751
01:23:11.405 --> 01:23:13.725
That's really subjective in some

1752
01:23:13.725 --> 01:23:14.925
of the information on your list.

1753
01:23:14.925 --> 01:23:18.005
In the paragraph below, it talks about ways to assist

1754
01:23:18.025 --> 01:23:19.925
and use, um, generative ai.

1755
01:23:20.225 --> 01:23:22.925
It does not include the fact that many teachers are asking

1756
01:23:23.485 --> 01:23:26.005
students to use AI to check their homework

1757
01:23:26.685 --> 01:23:29.375
because the teachers are not checking their homework.

1758
01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:32.615
So they're getting information using different platforms.

1759
01:23:32.635 --> 01:23:35.335
So we need to figure out if we have a homework policy

1760
01:23:35.595 --> 01:23:37.695
and our teachers are allowing students to use AI

1761
01:23:37.695 --> 01:23:39.295
to check their homework, how does

1762
01:23:39.295 --> 01:23:40.975
that roll into both our homework policy,

1763
01:23:41.115 --> 01:23:43.655
but also at what point do we draw the line

1764
01:23:43.655 --> 01:23:46.615
where checking our homework isn't necessarily abusing ai

1765
01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:48.255
but it's a necessary piece

1766
01:23:48.255 --> 01:23:50.455
because the teacher's not correcting the homework.

1767
01:23:51.685 --> 01:23:52.745
Um, another piece

1768
01:23:52.745 --> 01:23:55.505
that I found in the second will ask paragraph,

1769
01:23:55.505 --> 01:23:56.825
there is a statement according

1770
01:23:56.825 --> 01:23:58.345
to the instructor's discretion.

1771
01:23:59.105 --> 01:24:01.705
I would ask that wherever we have anything written like

1772
01:24:01.705 --> 01:24:03.665
this, according to the instructor's discretion,

1773
01:24:03.665 --> 01:24:04.945
that we really actually put some

1774
01:24:04.945 --> 01:24:06.345
more finite language into it.

1775
01:24:06.615 --> 01:24:08.665
Because I've noticed in many of the syllabus

1776
01:24:08.735 --> 01:24:11.985
that it basically is all over the map in terms of who,

1777
01:24:12.125 --> 01:24:14.825
how much, what's expected, percentages, et cetera.

1778
01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:17.425
And I think for a student who's trying to be aware

1779
01:24:17.525 --> 01:24:20.585
of when they step over a line, that it needs

1780
01:24:20.585 --> 01:24:22.745
to be less at the instructor's discretion

1781
01:24:22.745 --> 01:24:23.985
and more very specific

1782
01:24:24.085 --> 01:24:25.225
and a good good guidance

1783
01:24:25.325 --> 01:24:27.105
for those teachers, but also for the students.

1784
01:24:28.145 --> 01:24:31.505
Question for you, how do you cite an AI generated quote?

1785
01:24:32.225 --> 01:24:34.185
I would love to know that. 'cause I know in English class we

1786
01:24:34.185 --> 01:24:35.745
go through citing things from the internet.

1787
01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:38.225
We go through citing books, magazines, articles,

1788
01:24:38.525 --> 01:24:39.625
things on television.

1789
01:24:40.055 --> 01:24:42.545
I've not quite figured out how do you cite ai?

1790
01:24:43.465 --> 01:24:46.625
Actually, um, each of the groups like MLA are developing,

1791
01:24:47.205 --> 01:24:50.745
uh, and have developed site a ways of citing ai.

1792
01:24:50.805 --> 01:24:54.465
And if you go on, uh, Purdue Al, which is a, uh, typical

1793
01:24:55.285 --> 01:24:58.185
citing website where you can generate sites,

1794
01:24:58.535 --> 01:25:01.825
they do have the ability to generate, um, AI sighting.

1795
01:25:02.205 --> 01:25:03.825
That's great. So we're gonna start working

1796
01:25:03.825 --> 01:25:06.065
with our elementary students when they're developing the

1797
01:25:06.065 --> 01:25:08.345
ability to cite works that they get used to how to do that.

1798
01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:10.545
'cause we gotta start early, right? Mm-Hmm.

1799
01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:14.305
Um, on the following page, when we talk about compliance

1800
01:25:14.325 --> 01:25:17.865
and enforcement, the concern I have is that, um,

1801
01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:21.345
without being more definitive, the resulting decision

1802
01:25:21.345 --> 01:25:23.905
that a student is not being compliant is really subjective.

1803
01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.425
We need more parameters as to

1804
01:25:25.425 --> 01:25:26.825
what would trigger something like this.

1805
01:25:26.895 --> 01:25:29.745
What would be specifics that would actually call attention

1806
01:25:29.745 --> 01:25:31.465
to the fact that something seems very off.

1807
01:25:32.025 --> 01:25:33.185
I don't know what it is. Like all

1808
01:25:33.185 --> 01:25:35.425
of a sudden they're doing poorly then now their writing is

1809
01:25:35.425 --> 01:25:38.305
just like perfect, but figure it out and put in here.

1810
01:25:38.305 --> 01:25:40.545
Because the concern I have with this entire section is

1811
01:25:40.545 --> 01:25:41.945
that leaves it up to the discretion

1812
01:25:41.965 --> 01:25:44.705
of the instructor when the student could have done no wrong.

1813
01:25:44.705 --> 01:25:46.985
They now have to basically come to their own defense

1814
01:25:47.005 --> 01:25:50.065
to demonstrate in fact their use of whatever it is

1815
01:25:50.065 --> 01:25:51.465
that they did does not go

1816
01:25:51.465 --> 01:25:53.545
outside whatever lines it is the gray lines

1817
01:25:53.545 --> 01:25:55.065
that we're defining that they stepped over.

1818
01:25:55.545 --> 01:25:57.185
I don't think there's enough information in here.

1819
01:25:57.185 --> 01:26:00.505
And I'm concerned about one teacher in one class having one

1820
01:26:00.505 --> 01:26:01.825
view of when you step over the line,

1821
01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:03.410
another teacher having a different

1822
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:04.530
view and not having that alignment.

1823
01:26:04.905 --> 01:26:06.205
So I wanna put students in a

1824
01:26:06.365 --> 01:26:07.765
stressful situation where they just don't know.

1825
01:26:07.765 --> 01:26:09.925
But I think this needs to have more information in it

1826
01:26:10.225 --> 01:26:11.245
to help the teachers.

1827
01:26:11.745 --> 01:26:14.505
Um, again, I just think there needs

1828
01:26:14.505 --> 01:26:16.665
to be a lot more teacher input on some of this information.

1829
01:26:16.925 --> 01:26:19.545
Um, one of the questions I had was, we,

1830
01:26:19.575 --> 01:26:22.425
some students are being asked to utilize chat GPT

1831
01:26:22.565 --> 01:26:23.665
as part of their coursework.

1832
01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.985
So chat GPT, you set up an account to use it.

1833
01:26:27.445 --> 01:26:29.505
If the school district is requesting you to set up

1834
01:26:29.505 --> 01:26:31.385
and use a chat GPT, is that being

1835
01:26:31.385 --> 01:26:32.425
through the school district?

1836
01:26:32.445 --> 01:26:34.065
Are we setting up a separate sort

1837
01:26:34.065 --> 01:26:35.865
of boxed in use of the platform?

1838
01:26:36.245 --> 01:26:38.225
Or is this the student's own personal account?

1839
01:26:38.365 --> 01:26:40.425
And then are we then allowing staff

1840
01:26:40.525 --> 01:26:42.345
or teachers when they're reviewing the student work,

1841
01:26:42.825 --> 01:26:45.185
allowing them to then come inside the student's personal,

1842
01:26:45.845 --> 01:26:47.825
um, access to the platform?

1843
01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:51.505
So I don't know. I know that students have chat GPT at home.

1844
01:26:51.605 --> 01:26:53.385
Mm-Hmm. They probably are being, they're being asked

1845
01:26:53.385 --> 01:26:55.185
to use some platforms at school,

1846
01:26:55.405 --> 01:26:59.265
but there's this gray line between where is it ours

1847
01:26:59.365 --> 01:27:00.665
and where is it theirs

1848
01:27:00.885 --> 01:27:02.225
and how do we protect the privacy

1849
01:27:02.325 --> 01:27:04.105
of the information the student may have had

1850
01:27:04.105 --> 01:27:05.345
working on who knows what.

1851
01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:06.705
Maybe it's a college application

1852
01:27:06.705 --> 01:27:08.785
and they're, they're asking chat GBT

1853
01:27:08.785 --> 01:27:11.945
to help them like figure out like, what is the proper name

1854
01:27:11.945 --> 01:27:13.105
for a city in this location?

1855
01:27:13.265 --> 01:27:15.065
I don't know. But I just get worried

1856
01:27:15.065 --> 01:27:17.265
that we've got some blurred lines right now.

1857
01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:20.185
And if our staff are requesting that students share out some

1858
01:27:20.185 --> 01:27:22.545
of their information, their chat GBT they're using in

1859
01:27:22.545 --> 01:27:25.025
school, that it, it broadens the realm

1860
01:27:25.025 --> 01:27:26.225
of when we're getting into some

1861
01:27:26.225 --> 01:27:27.265
of their personal information.

1862
01:27:27.595 --> 01:27:28.665
Which I don't know what it is,

1863
01:27:28.665 --> 01:27:30.145
but I would ask that we start to define

1864
01:27:30.145 --> 01:27:31.185
where those lines are drawn

1865
01:27:31.185 --> 01:27:33.755
because I'm not seeing in the syllabus. Okay.

1866
01:27:34.495 --> 01:27:37.675
Um, but so may I ask for a clarification?

1867
01:27:37.975 --> 01:27:41.715
So if a student sends an email from their private account,

1868
01:27:41.935 --> 01:27:44.915
do you believe teachers have access to their personal email?

1869
01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:48.115
I only believe that, and the reason why I'm making this

1870
01:27:48.115 --> 01:27:52.315
request is that some courses require you to use AI platforms

1871
01:27:52.615 --> 01:27:55.595
and the teachers for purposes of reviewing some

1872
01:27:55.595 --> 01:27:58.315
of the information you're developing have asked for access

1873
01:27:58.415 --> 01:28:01.235
to your personal accounts

1874
01:28:01.235 --> 01:28:02.955
because they have to review what it is

1875
01:28:02.955 --> 01:28:04.955
that you're developing there as part of the project.

1876
01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:06.795
I could go into a lot more detail. I don't want to,

1877
01:28:07.255 --> 01:28:08.255
But Right. But, but yeah.

1878
01:28:08.255 --> 01:28:10.035
So I I I will make it very clear.

1879
01:28:10.175 --> 01:28:12.835
As a district we have policies that are

1880
01:28:12.835 --> 01:28:14.275
outside the AI policy

1881
01:28:14.495 --> 01:28:16.835
and there's no reason why

1882
01:28:17.355 --> 01:28:21.355
a teacher would have personal access to anybody's personal,

1883
01:28:21.855 --> 01:28:23.635
uh, platforms from home.

1884
01:28:24.095 --> 01:28:26.075
And if they're asking that, then you need

1885
01:28:26.075 --> 01:28:27.515
to let us know and we'll put a stop to it.

1886
01:28:27.815 --> 01:28:31.675
If they're gonna allow, uh, chat, uh, boxes to be used

1887
01:28:31.675 --> 01:28:33.275
during class time, then it needs

1888
01:28:33.275 --> 01:28:34.475
to be through the district system.

1889
01:28:35.095 --> 01:28:36.875
If not, and they're doing it at home,

1890
01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:39.795
they're still gonna have to cite where they got that.

1891
01:28:39.975 --> 01:28:41.795
But teachers will not have access

1892
01:28:41.855 --> 01:28:44.235
to anybody's personal technology.

1893
01:28:45.295 --> 01:28:46.475
And I appreciate the response.

1894
01:28:46.535 --> 01:28:47.795
The reason why I bring it up is simply

1895
01:28:47.795 --> 01:28:49.595
because we're in this new world of ai.

1896
01:28:49.775 --> 01:28:52.315
Mm-Hmm. Where a lot of the lines are blurred between like

1897
01:28:52.315 --> 01:28:54.755
where is it something you can use at home versus something

1898
01:28:54.755 --> 01:28:56.755
at school and at what point does it become something

1899
01:28:56.755 --> 01:28:58.595
where we need to see what the students developed at home

1900
01:28:58.595 --> 01:28:59.915
because the work is being done at home.

1901
01:29:00.415 --> 01:29:02.285
So it'd be nice if there was more information here

1902
01:29:02.285 --> 01:29:04.685
and guidance as to where we draw that line.

1903
01:29:05.055 --> 01:29:09.485
Where is it okay to authorize students to use AI

1904
01:29:09.505 --> 01:29:14.085
of some format at home to specific use the teacher requests

1905
01:29:14.435 --> 01:29:16.485
that isn't just random on the part of the student,

1906
01:29:16.505 --> 01:29:19.005
but specific request And at what point is

1907
01:29:19.285 --> 01:29:20.605
that information then carried over

1908
01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:21.685
and brought in front of the teacher?

1909
01:29:22.485 --> 01:29:24.005
I just see that there are lines right now,

1910
01:29:24.005 --> 01:29:25.605
they're very blurry and I don't think

1911
01:29:25.605 --> 01:29:27.605
because we've addressed it well here

1912
01:29:27.665 --> 01:29:30.245
or that maybe those teachers haven't been involved in the

1913
01:29:30.245 --> 01:29:31.765
development of this AR

1914
01:29:31.765 --> 01:29:33.645
and board policy that we're not hearing

1915
01:29:34.715 --> 01:29:36.085
that need that they have.

1916
01:29:36.425 --> 01:29:37.685
And so it's not written in here

1917
01:29:37.685 --> 01:29:40.045
and codified so that they know I've gotta pull

1918
01:29:40.045 --> 01:29:42.765
that piece back or I need to make other accommodations.

1919
01:29:42.865 --> 01:29:44.725
But I know that students are sort of confused

1920
01:29:44.925 --> 01:29:46.565
'cause they're hearing don't use chat GPT

1921
01:29:46.565 --> 01:29:48.005
and then teachers are saying, Hey,

1922
01:29:48.065 --> 01:29:49.685
and that's just one example of the platform.

1923
01:29:49.945 --> 01:29:52.205
Use it at home, develop this and bring it back to school.

1924
01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:55.885
So please, if there's a way to actually unblur those lines,

1925
01:29:56.085 --> 01:29:58.445
I think it would be very helpful for both the instructors

1926
01:29:58.445 --> 01:30:01.205
and it might change them a syllabus for next next spring.

1927
01:30:01.505 --> 01:30:03.085
But it would certainly be helpful for the students

1928
01:30:03.085 --> 01:30:05.005
to know when they cross that boundary

1929
01:30:05.065 --> 01:30:06.285
and what the boundary really is.

1930
01:30:06.285 --> 01:30:07.285
Thank you. Okay.

1931
01:30:07.665 --> 01:30:09.885
So I would simply add that um,

1932
01:30:10.025 --> 01:30:11.245
the reason why I would think

1933
01:30:11.245 --> 01:30:13.045
that the lines are blurry right now

1934
01:30:13.105 --> 01:30:14.365
is 'cause we have no policy.

1935
01:30:15.265 --> 01:30:17.525
So it's a wild, wild west right now.

1936
01:30:17.585 --> 01:30:20.525
And so creating a policy that provides guidelines,

1937
01:30:21.485 --> 01:30:24.565
implementing it for a year and seeing what works

1938
01:30:24.625 --> 01:30:26.805
and where we need to revise it, this is a policy

1939
01:30:27.305 --> 01:30:29.965
as we stated, is gonna have to be reviewed on a yearly basis

1940
01:30:30.205 --> 01:30:32.085
'cause AI changes so drastically.

1941
01:30:32.985 --> 01:30:36.005
Um, but I think those blurry lines right now is

1942
01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:38.045
'cause we have absolutely nothing to reference

1943
01:30:40.925 --> 01:30:42.785
And we also just approve the board policy.

1944
01:30:42.925 --> 01:30:47.505
We don't approve the ar. So that is developed by staff.

1945
01:30:48.465 --> 01:30:51.855
Um, are there any other questions or comments on this one?

1946
01:30:51.855 --> 01:30:54.765
Otherwise I will, um, just equal

1947
01:30:56.135 --> 01:30:58.475
Do Thers have to last an entire year?

1948
01:30:58.835 --> 01:31:02.475
I mean if something pressing comes up, it could be adjusted.

1949
01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:08.035
That's correct. ARS can be adjusted, um, in real time.

1950
01:31:08.655 --> 01:31:12.355
Thank you. I would hate

1951
01:31:12.355 --> 01:31:14.835
to throw a curve ball at people in real time.

1952
01:31:14.975 --> 01:31:16.795
You know, like all of a sudden we make a change

1953
01:31:17.375 --> 01:31:19.475
and on a Friday night and it happens on a Monday.

1954
01:31:19.595 --> 01:31:22.515
I wouldn't suggest that, but I would suggest a thoughtful

1955
01:31:22.515 --> 01:31:25.315
conversation of why we need to make a change mid-year.

1956
01:31:28.215 --> 01:31:29.905
Trustee speck you to question.

1957
01:31:30.025 --> 01:31:32.185
I was just gonna say a board policy also could come back

1958
01:31:32.285 --> 01:31:34.425
if a majority of us ask for it to come back

1959
01:31:34.445 --> 01:31:36.945
and we could adjust it, you know, at any point, right.

1960
01:31:37.085 --> 01:31:38.785
So yeah. Okay.

1961
01:31:41.275 --> 01:31:42.415
All right. I'm gonna go ahead

1962
01:31:42.415 --> 01:31:43.415
and call for a vote on this one

1963
01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:45.445
then, or I'm gonna call for a motion.

1964
01:31:45.645 --> 01:31:47.085
'cause I guess we don't have a motion on the flight.

1965
01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:50.245
I guess we should have done that before, but this is on

1966
01:31:50.245 --> 01:31:53.565
board policy 0 4 4 0 0.1.

1967
01:31:56.725 --> 01:32:01.245
I'll move that we approve board policy 0 4 4 0 0.1.

1968
01:32:01.605 --> 01:32:02.605
Artificial intelligence.

1969
01:32:05.635 --> 01:32:08.545
I second. All righty. I have a motion a second.

1970
01:32:08.545 --> 01:32:10.265
Do you have any other motions? Trustee Blackman?

1971
01:32:10.885 --> 01:32:12.185
I'd like to make a friendly amendment

1972
01:32:12.845 --> 01:32:15.305
to the motion put on the table by trustee spec

1973
01:32:15.935 --> 01:32:20.185
that it carries with a notation that the approved AR

1974
01:32:20.245 --> 01:32:22.905
and board policy would be transmitted to staff

1975
01:32:22.925 --> 01:32:24.705
and requested for comment by

1976
01:32:25.405 --> 01:32:26.945
no later than one month from now.

1977
01:32:30.695 --> 01:32:32.745
Sure. I will accept that for my motion.

1978
01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:42.825
I'll second that. Any other

1979
01:32:43.455 --> 01:32:44.705
motions or anything on the floor?

1980
01:32:45.365 --> 01:32:48.745
All right, I'm gonna call for a vote. Um, trustee Pesi.

1981
01:32:49.245 --> 01:32:50.425
Aye. Everyone else?

1982
01:32:50.885 --> 01:32:54.465
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Motion carries. Thank you.

1983
01:32:54.885 --> 01:32:56.585
All righty. Our next one

1984
01:32:57.565 --> 01:33:00.225
is G three, is that correct?

1985
01:33:02.705 --> 01:33:04.495
Thank you for letting me pull this up.

1986
01:33:04.595 --> 01:33:06.855
Um, you know, we're in the middle of election season, so,

1987
01:33:06.855 --> 01:33:08.535
and I know some things have changed recently,

1988
01:33:08.555 --> 01:33:12.175
but one of the things I've noticed both in the 9 2, 2 0

1989
01:33:12.175 --> 01:33:14.935
and 9 2 2 3 is that there's a lot of conflicts

1990
01:33:14.935 --> 01:33:16.015
between the documents

1991
01:33:16.015 --> 01:33:19.735
and current approaches of how elections are being run

1992
01:33:19.735 --> 01:33:22.415
by the county, but also certainly ways that we're required

1993
01:33:22.415 --> 01:33:25.415
to follow with regards to whether it's a interim

1994
01:33:25.755 --> 01:33:29.295
or a, whether we're having to put an election on the ballot

1995
01:33:29.635 --> 01:33:32.545
and an off election date.

1996
01:33:32.905 --> 01:33:34.025
I don't know how you would say that,

1997
01:33:34.125 --> 01:33:36.305
but one of the things that I brought up

1998
01:33:36.305 --> 01:33:39.105
before is that I know that ED code in the first paragraph

1999
01:33:39.105 --> 01:33:41.865
of the bylaw 9 2 2 0 states that you have

2000
01:33:41.865 --> 01:33:43.385
to be a citizen of California.

2001
01:33:43.925 --> 01:33:46.585
And I brought up that I don't believe anybody actually has

2002
01:33:46.655 --> 01:33:49.225
citizenship of California so much as we are a citizen

2003
01:33:49.285 --> 01:33:51.505
of the United States with residency in California.

2004
01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:54.865
And I requested that we go back to legal to find out like

2005
01:33:54.865 --> 01:33:56.705
how we could amend that because I actually think,

2006
01:33:57.065 --> 01:33:58.385
I don't know who wrote this, but citizen

2007
01:33:58.385 --> 01:34:00.625
of California is like a, I don't know where

2008
01:34:00.625 --> 01:34:01.905
that stated anywhere.

2009
01:34:03.085 --> 01:34:05.145
Is that on our DMV license or something?

2010
01:34:05.205 --> 01:34:06.545
Is, there's some statements in there

2011
01:34:06.545 --> 01:34:08.225
that calls us all citizens of California.

2012
01:34:08.425 --> 01:34:09.505
I didn't realize that anybody was

2013
01:34:09.505 --> 01:34:10.545
called a citizen of California.

2014
01:34:10.695 --> 01:34:12.345
Yeah, that statement comes, uh,

2015
01:34:12.375 --> 01:34:15.865
that phrase comes directly out of ED code 3 5 1 0 7.

2016
01:34:16.335 --> 01:34:17.785
Okay, I understand that,

2017
01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:19.705
but maybe somebody should send 'em a little note saying,

2018
01:34:19.705 --> 01:34:21.585
yeah, this needs to be cleaned up a bit.

2019
01:34:21.685 --> 01:34:26.425
Um, so one of the things that I wanted to go through is,

2020
01:34:26.565 --> 01:34:30.035
um, a couple things.

2021
01:34:30.295 --> 01:34:33.435
In the third paragraph down, we talk about, um,

2022
01:34:34.305 --> 01:34:35.715
that we will provide information

2023
01:34:35.715 --> 01:34:38.355
to new candidates if they upon their request.

2024
01:34:39.375 --> 01:34:41.755
Um, for every year that I have run for office,

2025
01:34:42.005 --> 01:34:44.675
we've actually requested candidates come to us.

2026
01:34:44.765 --> 01:34:47.515
Every candidate has been given the same offer to come

2027
01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.435
and meet with both the superintendent, legal

2028
01:34:49.855 --> 01:34:53.035
and the board president at the time to do a full review, uh,

2029
01:34:53.035 --> 01:34:55.995
review of the entire structuring of the district, all

2030
01:34:55.995 --> 01:34:57.195
of our meetings, all of our committees,

2031
01:34:58.025 --> 01:35:00.805
how board meetings are run, um, some of our bylaws,

2032
01:35:01.065 --> 01:35:03.285
our budget, as well as um, brown Act.

2033
01:35:03.705 --> 01:35:06.125
And I know that I found it incredibly helpful.

2034
01:35:06.945 --> 01:35:08.285
The third paragraph says

2035
01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:10.445
that it's only upon request by the candidate.

2036
01:35:10.445 --> 01:35:12.205
And I just wanna make this really clear

2037
01:35:12.205 --> 01:35:14.525
that most people can't know what they don't know,

2038
01:35:14.815 --> 01:35:16.805
especially when they're stepping into a seat

2039
01:35:16.805 --> 01:35:17.925
they've never been in before.

2040
01:35:18.505 --> 01:35:22.485
So to make it one part of our bylaw that they have to know

2041
01:35:22.485 --> 01:35:25.085
that they need it, I think really is disingenuous.

2042
01:35:25.145 --> 01:35:27.685
We should actually strike if we can that sentence out

2043
01:35:27.945 --> 01:35:30.405
and just whenever there are new candidates for a position

2044
01:35:30.405 --> 01:35:31.845
of the board that we will always provide

2045
01:35:31.845 --> 01:35:34.685
that orientation meeting whomever they are,

2046
01:35:34.685 --> 01:35:36.445
they can choose to attend or not.

2047
01:35:37.505 --> 01:35:38.565
So that's my first comment.

2048
01:35:39.105 --> 01:35:41.125
Um, one of the things I find

2049
01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:44.245
that's a little bit confusing about the issues with regard

2050
01:35:44.245 --> 01:35:47.685
to calling recalling board members is I'm very concerned

2051
01:35:47.685 --> 01:35:52.245
with the dates and the requirement now stated by the state

2052
01:35:52.325 --> 01:35:56.485
of California that in fact any recall document actually has

2053
01:35:56.485 --> 01:35:58.125
to include the cost estimate

2054
01:35:58.145 --> 01:35:59.845
of conducting a special election.

2055
01:36:01.025 --> 01:36:03.285
One of the things that occurs is when um,

2056
01:36:03.345 --> 01:36:04.565
you're recalling a board member,

2057
01:36:04.565 --> 01:36:06.525
there's a certain time limit that is provided

2058
01:36:06.985 --> 01:36:08.205
and dictated by the county.

2059
01:36:09.025 --> 01:36:11.245
So to ask a recall group

2060
01:36:11.245 --> 01:36:13.685
or individual, whoever that might be, that they have

2061
01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:16.445
to rely on county information that is then verified

2062
01:36:16.445 --> 01:36:19.005
or worked on with a school district to validate the cost

2063
01:36:19.005 --> 01:36:21.445
of the election eats into that time window.

2064
01:36:21.705 --> 01:36:22.925
And so I would ask that,

2065
01:36:23.365 --> 01:36:25.645
I don't think anybody thought about this when they wrote

2066
01:36:25.645 --> 01:36:27.725
some of these requirements for funding,

2067
01:36:28.305 --> 01:36:32.365
but it seems like we need clarification as to the timeliness

2068
01:36:32.365 --> 01:36:33.725
of that when it occurs,

2069
01:36:33.785 --> 01:36:37.365
but also when the clock starts for that petition.

2070
01:36:37.545 --> 01:36:40.685
So if they're given 30 days, um,

2071
01:36:41.305 --> 01:36:43.085
and it takes the board

2072
01:36:43.385 --> 01:36:45.205
or maybe not the board, it takes the county

2073
01:36:45.225 --> 01:36:48.765
and the district 10 days, then they have one third less time

2074
01:36:49.035 --> 01:36:52.645
because of procedural processes to provide them with data.

2075
01:36:53.305 --> 01:36:54.845
So it'd be great if both the county

2076
01:36:54.945 --> 01:36:57.205
and maybe whoever created this, um,

2077
01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:00.325
new code could actually validate whether

2078
01:37:00.345 --> 01:37:01.485
or not the clock starts

2079
01:37:01.495 --> 01:37:04.285
after that information was received by that committee

2080
01:37:04.345 --> 01:37:08.925
or group or if it incorporates that delay in

2081
01:37:08.945 --> 01:37:12.005
of information before they can initiate their process.

2082
01:37:14.055 --> 01:37:16.435
So that's one thing. Um, I also noticed

2083
01:37:16.435 --> 01:37:19.755
that there's information about, um, the consolidation

2084
01:37:19.755 --> 01:37:21.595
of elections, which seems

2085
01:37:21.595 --> 01:37:24.355
that when we talk about consolidation of elections, um,

2086
01:37:25.895 --> 01:37:28.835
if we're outside the six month point, um,

2087
01:37:28.935 --> 01:37:32.115
it seems like the decision could be to push everything back

2088
01:37:32.135 --> 01:37:33.915
to a regularly scheduled election.

2089
01:37:34.695 --> 01:37:36.995
So I know that that doesn't seem to make any sense.

2090
01:37:37.475 --> 01:37:38.755
I know that some of this is code,

2091
01:37:38.775 --> 01:37:41.635
but wherever we can write, we should clarify, um,

2092
01:37:42.905 --> 01:37:45.235
that we're not held to basically pushing everything

2093
01:37:45.235 --> 01:37:47.275
to regular election because in the verbiage

2094
01:37:47.555 --> 01:37:49.435
provided that if you're 240 days out,

2095
01:37:49.855 --> 01:37:52.075
you could be pushed not to a March date,

2096
01:37:52.135 --> 01:37:55.155
but back to a November date, which seems just absurd.

2097
01:37:56.305 --> 01:37:58.645
So I understand that these are some things coming from the

2098
01:37:58.645 --> 01:38:00.845
state, but I find that the information is, um,

2099
01:38:01.115 --> 01:38:03.245
very conflicting and if anything is designed

2100
01:38:03.245 --> 01:38:07.085
to really prohibit people from voicing their opinion, one

2101
01:38:07.085 --> 01:38:09.845
of the other things I wanna ask about is we have in the

2102
01:38:09.845 --> 01:38:11.325
statement, under election processes

2103
01:38:11.325 --> 01:38:14.605
and procedures, it states that under government, um, code,

2104
01:38:14.865 --> 01:38:17.285
the board member whose term has expired shall continue

2105
01:38:17.285 --> 01:38:18.805
to discharge the duties of the office

2106
01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:21.805
until a successor has qualified by taking the oath

2107
01:38:21.805 --> 01:38:23.845
of office throughout the document.

2108
01:38:24.145 --> 01:38:27.805
The oath of O office is often stated as if it's some trigger

2109
01:38:27.805 --> 01:38:28.925
that occurs after the election.

2110
01:38:28.925 --> 01:38:30.605
But I will point out that the county

2111
01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:33.405
of Alameda has every candidate take the oath

2112
01:38:33.405 --> 01:38:35.245
of office when they fill out their paperwork.

2113
01:38:35.745 --> 01:38:38.445
So that oath of office technically has occurred in August

2114
01:38:39.715 --> 01:38:42.735
and I know that we have to receive our confirmation from,

2115
01:38:42.995 --> 01:38:46.095
um, the county officer with regard to the outcome

2116
01:38:46.095 --> 01:38:49.255
of elections, but we shouldn't be predating those decisions

2117
01:38:49.255 --> 01:38:51.655
based on an oath of office being, uh,

2118
01:38:51.655 --> 01:38:53.895
there's a document in here that says that somebody has

2119
01:38:53.895 --> 01:38:55.215
to turn in or file a document,

2120
01:38:55.235 --> 01:38:56.735
but that information's already been filed.

2121
01:38:57.315 --> 01:38:58.535
So a little bit of discussion

2122
01:38:58.535 --> 01:39:00.615
with the county would be helpful because what they're doing

2123
01:39:00.615 --> 01:39:03.695
and what we're we're being held to doesn't seem to jive.

2124
01:39:04.475 --> 01:39:06.855
Um, so that was my, some of the earlier pieces

2125
01:39:06.885 --> 01:39:09.655
that I thought were a little bit off, um,

2126
01:39:11.005 --> 01:39:14.135
there's just a lot of information in here that doesn't seem

2127
01:39:14.135 --> 01:39:16.215
to jive with, we're also by area.

2128
01:39:16.795 --> 01:39:19.135
And so it gets complicated with regard to the fact

2129
01:39:19.135 --> 01:39:22.055
that we have elections every other year and it's by area.

2130
01:39:22.315 --> 01:39:25.375
And I think that there's some misunderstanding about,

2131
01:39:25.995 --> 01:39:27.135
um, I'll give you an example.

2132
01:39:27.935 --> 01:39:29.095
Somebody runs for office

2133
01:39:29.355 --> 01:39:31.775
and they're outside of this certain, uh,

2134
01:39:32.285 --> 01:39:35.975
four month timeline, then we would end up appointing them

2135
01:39:36.355 --> 01:39:38.135
and they would basically sit in that seat

2136
01:39:38.225 --> 01:39:40.415
until which time there was an election

2137
01:39:40.595 --> 01:39:42.455
and there could be somebody else running for that election,

2138
01:39:42.795 --> 01:39:44.215
but it's very possible nobody does,

2139
01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:46.775
in which case they would've served for all of like three

2140
01:39:46.775 --> 01:39:47.935
or four months and been gone.

2141
01:39:48.475 --> 01:39:50.655
But at the same time, because of one of our processes,

2142
01:39:50.655 --> 01:39:52.495
if somebody else leaves the seat,

2143
01:39:52.515 --> 01:39:54.335
we can still appoint within that period of time.

2144
01:39:54.635 --> 01:39:57.215
But if it's an elected seat that is up for election for

2145
01:39:57.215 --> 01:40:00.175
that November, they would basically be sworn in on

2146
01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:02.855
November 6th and be sworn out like the very next day when

2147
01:40:02.855 --> 01:40:04.975
the other person's seated like a day or two later.

2148
01:40:05.955 --> 01:40:08.495
So there's just some information that by area doesn't seem

2149
01:40:08.495 --> 01:40:11.695
to jive, um, that's in this document that doesn't jive

2150
01:40:11.695 --> 01:40:13.135
with being a by area district.

2151
01:40:13.235 --> 01:40:14.975
And it'd be great if we could go back to the county

2152
01:40:14.995 --> 01:40:17.135
and ask them like, how do we rectify some

2153
01:40:17.135 --> 01:40:19.775
of these issues when we could end up appointing somebody

2154
01:40:19.775 --> 01:40:21.775
who would literally be unseed the very next day.

2155
01:40:22.795 --> 01:40:25.295
Um, so that's my comments on G three.

2156
01:40:25.735 --> 01:40:30.175
I just find that, um, unfortunately we're stuck

2157
01:40:30.175 --> 01:40:33.655
with some really bad, um, decisions by Sacramento.

2158
01:40:34.155 --> 01:40:37.015
Um, but the one thing that I would definitely want us

2159
01:40:37.015 --> 01:40:40.135
to change is that in paragraph three, that we

2160
01:40:40.725 --> 01:40:45.025
scratch the piece upon request by the candidate to enable us

2161
01:40:45.045 --> 01:40:47.465
to always offer this regardless if the

2162
01:40:47.465 --> 01:40:48.505
candidate asks or not.

2163
01:40:50.915 --> 01:40:54.005
So as a staff of recommendation, I,

2164
01:40:54.125 --> 01:40:55.845
I have no objections to striking that.

2165
01:40:55.985 --> 01:40:59.725
Uh, I, I personally, uh, reached out to the three candidates

2166
01:40:59.905 --> 01:41:03.565
and invited them to come in, um, to learn about the district

2167
01:41:03.665 --> 01:41:05.885
and provide them necessary information.

2168
01:41:06.345 --> 01:41:08.285
It was not with the board president, it was not

2169
01:41:08.285 --> 01:41:12.125
with legal counsel, it was with, uh, Chris Hobbs and myself.

2170
01:41:12.625 --> 01:41:17.365
Uh, the Brown Act will be, um, they'll be given a full, um,

2171
01:41:18.675 --> 01:41:20.695
review of the Brown Act by legal counsel

2172
01:41:21.525 --> 01:41:23.735
once they're elected, not prior to.

2173
01:41:25.065 --> 01:41:28.385
I understand. I just found my own perspective was it was

2174
01:41:28.385 --> 01:41:31.225
helpful to have, especially the board president in the room

2175
01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:33.025
and legal because there were questions I know

2176
01:41:33.025 --> 01:41:35.625
that I had about aspects of the walkthrough that I,

2177
01:41:35.925 --> 01:41:37.185
it was helpful to hear the point

2178
01:41:37.185 --> 01:41:38.265
of view from another board member.

2179
01:41:39.435 --> 01:41:40.435
So

2180
01:41:41.065 --> 01:41:42.775
Could we just change the wording on here

2181
01:41:44.835 --> 01:41:48.165
shall offer the board candidate information,

2182
01:41:48.165 --> 01:41:52.335
like we can't force them to come take it kind of a thing.

2183
01:41:52.415 --> 01:41:53.655
I mean, I would, I don't know why they wouldn't,

2184
01:41:53.715 --> 01:41:57.455
but instead of, shall offer a board candidate

2185
01:41:58.895 --> 01:42:02.915
take out upon request of the candidate information,

2186
01:42:04.685 --> 01:42:06.655
does that make sense to people or am I just

2187
01:42:08.785 --> 01:42:10.275
Yeah, that's, I like that.

2188
01:42:10.775 --> 01:42:13.635
Um, the other thing I would ask is, is there any way

2189
01:42:13.635 --> 01:42:17.035
to find out from the election officials in the county

2190
01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:21.005
how long it takes them to turn around the cost for a recall?

2191
01:42:23.365 --> 01:42:24.365
'cause

2192
01:42:24.825 --> 01:42:26.165
It, you can always ask that,

2193
01:42:26.165 --> 01:42:27.805
but that has no, no relevance to

2194
01:42:28.435 --> 01:42:29.435
This policy. No,

2195
01:42:29.435 --> 01:42:30.005
no, it doesn't.

2196
01:42:30.065 --> 01:42:31.445
But I think it would be helpful to meet

2197
01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:33.445
with our state legislators to basically talk

2198
01:42:33.685 --> 01:42:35.365
to them about some of the es

2199
01:42:35.385 --> 01:42:37.965
of this information if we had better data that we could go

2200
01:42:37.965 --> 01:42:39.485
to them with and ask them for a change.

2201
01:42:41.545 --> 01:42:43.045
So it would be helpful, uh,

2202
01:42:43.145 --> 01:42:45.525
if we could determine the motion that you would like

2203
01:42:45.525 --> 01:42:47.125
to bring forward with the specific

2204
01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:48.245
change that you're requesting.

2205
01:42:50.485 --> 01:42:53.465
All right. Well, I will just, um, can I ask one question?

2206
01:42:53.685 --> 01:42:57.825
If we have a section that talks about, um, an oath

2207
01:42:59.005 --> 01:43:02.155
taken, can we qualify that?

2208
01:43:04.285 --> 01:43:05.325
I don't know how to do this,

2209
01:43:05.425 --> 01:43:08.525
but the, it seems like everywhere in the document

2210
01:43:08.525 --> 01:43:09.845
and then the other document talks about

2211
01:43:10.065 --> 01:43:12.245
as if the oath is taken after the election,

2212
01:43:12.665 --> 01:43:14.485
but in fact the oath is taken before,

2213
01:43:14.695 --> 01:43:15.695
Don't we? Do you want an oath

2214
01:43:15.695 --> 01:43:16.365
at the meeting

2215
01:43:16.365 --> 01:43:17.565
when we swear everybody in?

2216
01:43:18.445 --> 01:43:20.425
The oath is taken in August at

2217
01:43:20.425 --> 01:43:21.585
the county register's office,

2218
01:43:21.725 --> 01:43:24.945
But there's also the formal swearing in at the meeting.

2219
01:43:25.495 --> 01:43:27.905
That oath means nothing. That's just for purposes

2220
01:43:27.905 --> 01:43:29.985
of a ceremony.

2221
01:43:30.125 --> 01:43:32.465
The actual oath has happened when you filed your papers

2222
01:43:36.035 --> 01:43:38.925
that that oath is solely, you know, so people can be here

2223
01:43:38.925 --> 01:43:40.085
and witness it and whatever,

2224
01:43:40.185 --> 01:43:41.805
but the actual oath has already happened.

2225
01:43:46.165 --> 01:43:47.865
But at that point, you're taking an,

2226
01:43:47.865 --> 01:43:50.345
you're not being sworn into office at that point.

2227
01:43:50.525 --> 01:43:54.265
If it's a contested election, you're taking an oath,

2228
01:43:55.125 --> 01:43:56.745
but you're not being sworn into office at

2229
01:43:56.745 --> 01:44:00.445
that point in time when you pull your papers.

2230
01:44:00.625 --> 01:44:03.845
No, you're not. However, like the person for area three

2231
01:44:03.845 --> 01:44:06.365
that ran unopposed, uh,

2232
01:44:06.365 --> 01:44:08.405
is actually covered under the Brown Act right now

2233
01:44:09.185 --> 01:44:11.755
because they are a

2234
01:44:12.625 --> 01:44:14.675
presumptive, uh, board member

2235
01:44:16.785 --> 01:44:19.585
At the, So they, they would need

2236
01:44:19.585 --> 01:44:21.545
that round act training as soon as possible

2237
01:44:21.545 --> 01:44:23.705
because they are covered by it right now.

2238
01:44:26.545 --> 01:44:28.645
Um, So the reason why I was bringing this up is

2239
01:44:28.645 --> 01:44:30.885
that if we could add verbiage somewhere in here

2240
01:44:30.885 --> 01:44:33.285
that acknowledges that the county

2241
01:44:33.285 --> 01:44:35.845
of Alameda actually provides the oath of office

2242
01:44:36.355 --> 01:44:39.645
when a candidate pulls papers just to acknowledge it so

2243
01:44:39.645 --> 01:44:42.125
that there's, we at least have it somewhere in the document

2244
01:44:42.185 --> 01:44:43.565
so that when there's a conflict,

2245
01:44:43.565 --> 01:44:44.645
it's not like we didn't know.

2246
01:44:50.205 --> 01:44:53.345
So, uh, um, again, we are following the ED code

2247
01:44:53.445 --> 01:44:55.265
and the election code, um,

2248
01:44:55.805 --> 01:45:00.265
and if there is something that I comes in the future

2249
01:45:00.875 --> 01:45:03.905
where someone is challenged, it would be the register

2250
01:45:03.905 --> 01:45:06.385
of off, uh, voters that would make that decision.

2251
01:45:07.125 --> 01:45:12.045
Um, so again, I'm asking for specific changes in

2252
01:45:12.045 --> 01:45:15.005
that third paragraph that you're, that you're asking for.

2253
01:45:15.585 --> 01:45:18.485
All the other things are tied to ed code and election code

2254
01:45:18.665 --> 01:45:20.685
and, uh, not being an attorney.

2255
01:45:20.925 --> 01:45:22.685
I would not recommend making any

2256
01:45:22.685 --> 01:45:24.125
of those changes at this time.

2257
01:45:29.165 --> 01:45:31.335
Then the only changes we can make is that third section

2258
01:45:31.475 --> 01:45:33.935
and then maybe we can meet with legal at some point

2259
01:45:33.935 --> 01:45:36.495
after this is approved so we can review the things we'd like

2260
01:45:36.495 --> 01:45:37.975
to get answers from the county on.

2261
01:45:43.995 --> 01:45:46.635
I I'm not in favor of spending our legal dollars on that.

2262
01:45:46.955 --> 01:45:50.235
I, I just, I don't think that we, Dublin Unified is going

2263
01:45:50.235 --> 01:45:53.315
to change the counties

2264
01:45:54.175 --> 01:45:55.475
and the law out there,

2265
01:45:55.475 --> 01:45:58.755
and I'd rather our our staff focus on

2266
01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.355
educating our students.

2267
01:46:01.725 --> 01:46:03.525
I mean, I, I understand what you're saying

2268
01:46:03.545 --> 01:46:07.005
and it's frustrating, but, um, we have limited staff

2269
01:46:07.545 --> 01:46:08.925
and I would not be in favor

2270
01:46:08.925 --> 01:46:10.965
of them spending effort and time on this.

2271
01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.665
All right. Do we have a motion on the floor?

2272
01:46:19.925 --> 01:46:23.645
Are we motion on this one? Trustee Blackman?

2273
01:46:24.445 --> 01:46:26.125
I, I also, um, would like

2274
01:46:26.125 --> 01:46:28.685
to make a comment under consolidation of elections,

2275
01:46:29.345 --> 01:46:31.125
the discussion about the 25%

2276
01:46:31.125 --> 01:46:33.085
or more compared to the average local turnout

2277
01:46:33.085 --> 01:46:35.005
for a previous four statewide general election.

2278
01:46:35.385 --> 01:46:36.845
Uh, one of the concerns I have is we

2279
01:46:36.845 --> 01:46:38.005
do our elections by area.

2280
01:46:38.315 --> 01:46:40.205
This presumes that we're doing it by city

2281
01:46:40.265 --> 01:46:42.125
and we're basing the information on by city.

2282
01:46:42.585 --> 01:46:46.525
We do not have four prior statewide elections from which

2283
01:46:46.545 --> 01:46:49.125
to pull information for our bi area election.

2284
01:46:49.265 --> 01:46:51.845
So again, this is one of those things where I don't know

2285
01:46:51.845 --> 01:46:53.085
how we would respond to this

2286
01:46:53.085 --> 01:46:54.645
because we don't actually have the largest

2287
01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:56.605
of information broken out by each area

2288
01:46:56.625 --> 01:46:58.525
for the last election, last four elections.

2289
01:46:58.545 --> 01:47:01.405
So again, I, I understand we don't wanna burn legal time,

2290
01:47:01.425 --> 01:47:03.885
but we have information in here as to how we would conduct

2291
01:47:04.185 --> 01:47:06.805
and we yet can't do it based on the information here.

2292
01:47:06.945 --> 01:47:09.565
So there's not that I want us to go in

2293
01:47:10.075 --> 01:47:11.205
into deep into the woods,

2294
01:47:11.265 --> 01:47:13.965
but a nice letter to our legislator that explains

2295
01:47:13.965 --> 01:47:15.165
what the issues are with this

2296
01:47:15.165 --> 01:47:17.005
and how it applies to us would certainly allow them

2297
01:47:17.025 --> 01:47:19.085
to take this up next time they're in session.

2298
01:47:24.315 --> 01:47:26.415
All righty. I'm gonna call for a motion on this one.

2299
01:47:26.415 --> 01:47:28.095
I don't think we have a motion on the floor at this point,

2300
01:47:28.095 --> 01:47:30.425
and I think we need to move on.

2301
01:47:32.455 --> 01:47:33.455
Anyone,

2302
01:47:34.185 --> 01:47:37.355
I'll move that We approve bylaw 92 20 governing board

2303
01:47:37.555 --> 01:47:40.875
elections with the, um, addition of,

2304
01:47:41.015 --> 01:47:44.075
in the third paragraph we scrap the, um,

2305
01:47:44.095 --> 01:47:46.475
or we x out the upon request by the candidate.

2306
01:47:46.475 --> 01:47:49.995
That is listed twice in there.

2307
01:47:50.595 --> 01:47:51.995
I think I'm only seen it once,

2308
01:47:52.095 --> 01:47:56.185
but yes, it's, it's there twice.

2309
01:47:56.405 --> 01:47:58.745
And to strike it out both times, um,

2310
01:47:58.845 --> 01:48:00.945
the words upon request by the candidate.

2311
01:48:05.675 --> 01:48:08.815
One second. Uh, just for clarification,

2312
01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.375
the other piece was shall provide.

2313
01:48:10.375 --> 01:48:14.095
We can't force them to come in so may

2314
01:48:14.095 --> 01:48:15.095
Offer, right? I guess I was thinking

2315
01:48:15.095 --> 01:48:15.695
of an email.

2316
01:48:15.995 --> 01:48:18.655
You know, if you email them, they, you have provided it.

2317
01:48:19.555 --> 01:48:22.175
Um, and so I, I actually kind of like the shall provide,

2318
01:48:22.175 --> 01:48:25.255
like you have to send them an email, um, I'd like you

2319
01:48:25.255 --> 01:48:26.415
to do more, but if they don't wanna come

2320
01:48:26.415 --> 01:48:27.735
and meet with you, then you can't do anymore.

2321
01:48:27.795 --> 01:48:30.255
But you can, um, send them an email

2322
01:48:30.395 --> 01:48:31.615
and give 'em the information and

2323
01:48:31.615 --> 01:48:33.735
that way we're showing like we expect that.

2324
01:48:33.835 --> 01:48:36.135
Yep. Makes perfect sense. Thank you for the clarification.

2325
01:48:38.155 --> 01:48:39.885
Okay, we have a motion and a second on

2326
01:48:39.885 --> 01:48:40.925
the floor on this one.

2327
01:48:41.025 --> 01:48:44.505
Any other motions? All right,

2328
01:48:44.505 --> 01:48:46.665
trustee pe Aye.

2329
01:48:47.225 --> 01:48:49.375
Everyone else? Aye, aye, aye, aye.

2330
01:48:51.235 --> 01:48:53.975
So G four really quickly, um, one of the things

2331
01:48:53.975 --> 01:48:57.055
that I wanted clarification on is on, um, that's

2332
01:48:57.055 --> 01:48:59.495
by law 9 2 2 3 filling vacancies.

2333
01:48:59.725 --> 01:49:02.135
Item number six talks about board members ceasing

2334
01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:04.855
to inhabit the trustee area represented by the board member.

2335
01:49:05.415 --> 01:49:08.375
I think we've had a situation whereby area actually put us

2336
01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.695
in a situation where we, we had a change,

2337
01:49:11.115 --> 01:49:13.135
but we wouldn't necessarily ask them to

2338
01:49:13.775 --> 01:49:16.775
vacate their seat just because the boundary changed.

2339
01:49:16.955 --> 01:49:18.615
We actually allowed them to stay in their seat

2340
01:49:18.615 --> 01:49:20.735
because they were elected for the duration of their term.

2341
01:49:21.355 --> 01:49:23.575
And this government code doesn't cover us under that.

2342
01:49:23.715 --> 01:49:26.495
So that was one thing that I thought was, doesn't align

2343
01:49:26.495 --> 01:49:29.575
with the policy and approach that we've taken. Um,

2344
01:49:30.555 --> 01:49:32.135
So I did check with legal on this one,

2345
01:49:32.155 --> 01:49:33.415
and this is very specific.

2346
01:49:33.515 --> 01:49:36.975
If someone is, um, a trustee in area one

2347
01:49:37.475 --> 01:49:40.815
and they voluntarily move to a different area by law,

2348
01:49:40.815 --> 01:49:42.975
they must give up their seat in the

2349
01:49:43.375 --> 01:49:44.495
situation that the board took.

2350
01:49:44.675 --> 01:49:47.685
The board adjusted the trustee areas

2351
01:49:47.945 --> 01:49:50.685
and the sitting trustee gets to finish their term

2352
01:49:51.145 --> 01:49:53.325
and then they cannot, they're not eligible to run again.

2353
01:49:53.945 --> 01:49:55.565
That's great. I appreciate the clarification.

2354
01:49:55.645 --> 01:49:58.005
I would just ask that maybe, I know we can write the

2355
01:49:58.005 --> 01:49:59.405
government codes down, but could we add,

2356
01:49:59.465 --> 01:50:01.365
add a clarifying statement to it just about

2357
01:50:01.365 --> 01:50:03.885
that this pertains to an individual moves out of their area?

2358
01:50:04.845 --> 01:50:06.695
That was in the previous one.

2359
01:50:06.695 --> 01:50:11.625
It it specifically laid out if it was changed,

2360
01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:13.305
it, it specifically laid out.

2361
01:50:13.475 --> 01:50:15.985
There was two different lines in the previous one.

2362
01:50:17.045 --> 01:50:21.425
Um, since I'm very familiar with what happened on this, um,

2363
01:50:23.855 --> 01:50:25.865
that if they move out that, so I,

2364
01:50:26.025 --> 01:50:28.265
I don't know, I think they're kind of related.

2365
01:50:29.125 --> 01:50:32.385
Um, and it did, it did refer to if a trustee moved out

2366
01:50:32.385 --> 01:50:36.105
of their area versus a trustee's area was re revised.

2367
01:50:36.725 --> 01:50:38.145
Um, it was on the previous.

2368
01:50:40.405 --> 01:50:41.485
I agree. But this is separate.

2369
01:50:42.025 --> 01:50:44.805
Um, bylaw, it'd be helpful it fit that it lines

2370
01:50:44.805 --> 01:50:46.045
with the other information.

2371
01:50:48.915 --> 01:50:50.485
Yeah, I mean I, I would agree with that.

2372
01:50:50.645 --> 01:50:53.765
I, I, um, I think we could just add some simple words like

2373
01:50:53.945 --> 01:50:57.525
accept in the situation of, um,

2374
01:50:58.025 --> 01:50:59.605
and we had the words over here, the

2375
01:51:01.345 --> 01:51:04.395
decennial federal census adjustments causing

2376
01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:06.155
a trustee to be outta area.

2377
01:51:06.185 --> 01:51:08.555
Just so it's very clear. I mean I remember watching the

2378
01:51:08.555 --> 01:51:10.475
board when the, the vote happened and,

2379
01:51:10.535 --> 01:51:12.795
and everyone was like, well wait, what,

2380
01:51:12.795 --> 01:51:13.955
what exactly then happens?

2381
01:51:14.175 --> 01:51:17.195
And so then it's just clearly in the policy.

2382
01:51:19.435 --> 01:51:20.535
So it could just be a phrase

2383
01:51:20.535 --> 01:51:23.655
after that statement so that it's clear that, um,

2384
01:51:24.515 --> 01:51:25.615
So for number six,

2385
01:51:25.615 --> 01:51:29.255
Correct, number six, you if you cease to inhabit,

2386
01:51:29.715 --> 01:51:31.175
you can't be a board member

2387
01:51:31.515 --> 01:51:35.255
unless the one situation every 10 years

2388
01:51:36.005 --> 01:51:37.695
when we redo them for the census.

2389
01:51:41.505 --> 01:51:44.435
Does that, Sorry, makes sense to everybody. So

2390
01:51:45.095 --> 01:51:47.015
The next item was item seven

2391
01:51:47.585 --> 01:51:49.415
talks about board member absence from the state

2392
01:51:49.415 --> 01:51:50.415
for more than 60 days.

2393
01:51:50.555 --> 01:51:52.615
And we have this really interesting situation

2394
01:51:52.615 --> 01:51:55.335
because we just approved policy by which you can be remote

2395
01:51:55.515 --> 01:51:56.615
for some of our meetings

2396
01:51:56.995 --> 01:51:58.495
and the case of November, December,

2397
01:51:58.495 --> 01:51:59.895
when we have one meeting, each

2398
01:51:59.895 --> 01:52:02.335
of those months a board member could actually be absent,

2399
01:52:03.095 --> 01:52:04.575
I believe or out of state

2400
01:52:04.575 --> 01:52:05.735
and dial into one

2401
01:52:05.735 --> 01:52:07.975
of our meetings without actually triggering this.

2402
01:52:08.075 --> 01:52:09.415
But the way it's worded, it says

2403
01:52:09.415 --> 01:52:12.335
that if you're just outta state for 60 days, you're toast.

2404
01:52:13.395 --> 01:52:16.455
So how do we address something where in fact we allow a,

2405
01:52:16.535 --> 01:52:19.895
a trustee for whatever reason, if it's family remote

2406
01:52:19.895 --> 01:52:21.055
or they're at a conference

2407
01:52:21.055 --> 01:52:22.855
and they even, they're representing the district at some

2408
01:52:22.975 --> 01:52:24.695
event, they might not be present

2409
01:52:25.595 --> 01:52:27.495
and so they could still attend. Um,

2410
01:52:28.395 --> 01:52:29.695
But I don't think you're gonna have that

2411
01:52:30.275 --> 01:52:31.455
for more than 60 days.

2412
01:52:31.875 --> 01:52:35.295
And I mean, I think, I think there is reasons for that

2413
01:52:35.295 --> 01:52:37.055
because you're not in the district at that point.

2414
01:52:37.055 --> 01:52:38.895
You're not able to meet with constituents.

2415
01:52:38.895 --> 01:52:40.495
You're not around.

2416
01:52:41.375 --> 01:52:43.495
I I I think we definitely have the,

2417
01:52:43.595 --> 01:52:47.135
the reasons you can call in, but that's,

2418
01:52:47.135 --> 01:52:48.295
and also that's government code.

2419
01:52:48.295 --> 01:52:49.815
Um, trustee chair, have your hand up.

2420
01:52:50.325 --> 01:52:52.255
Yeah, I would agree with what you're saying.

2421
01:52:52.285 --> 01:52:56.015
That if you're gone out of the state for 60 days

2422
01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.735
and regardless of the meetings there,

2423
01:52:57.735 --> 01:52:59.415
there's a way you could probably call into those,

2424
01:52:59.595 --> 01:53:03.815
but you're not available to the con con constituents

2425
01:53:03.845 --> 01:53:06.415
that elected you and you're not,

2426
01:53:06.415 --> 01:53:07.775
you're not there to do your job.

2427
01:53:08.395 --> 01:53:11.295
So that is a problem. So,

2428
01:53:12.165 --> 01:53:13.495
Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

2429
01:53:13.575 --> 01:53:14.655
I wasn't understanding that it had

2430
01:53:14.655 --> 01:53:15.775
to do with meeting constituents.

2431
01:53:16.035 --> 01:53:17.535
So I thought it just had to do

2432
01:53:17.535 --> 01:53:18.775
with being able to do your duties.

2433
01:53:19.015 --> 01:53:20.215
'cause we now have digital world. That

2434
01:53:20.215 --> 01:53:21.215
Is just my opinion. That's

2435
01:53:21.215 --> 01:53:24.775
not meeting it means nothing. But I mean, uh,

2436
01:53:26.575 --> 01:53:27.575
I would agree. I feel like if

2437
01:53:27.575 --> 01:53:30.775
you are for some reason out of the state,

2438
01:53:30.985 --> 01:53:33.775
which is a very big place for more than 60 days,

2439
01:53:34.475 --> 01:53:35.895
you're probably not able

2440
01:53:35.895 --> 01:53:37.015
to do your job at that point in time.

2441
01:53:38.035 --> 01:53:40.775
Um, or, and there are some exceptions.

2442
01:53:40.995 --> 01:53:45.885
So I, I think I'm okay with, with leaving that as is.

2443
01:53:47.475 --> 01:53:50.895
The next time I wanna bring up is item, um, 10, which has

2444
01:53:50.895 --> 01:53:52.175
to do with board members' refusal

2445
01:53:52.175 --> 01:53:54.055
or neglect to file the required oath

2446
01:53:54.635 --> 01:53:56.015
within the time prescribed.

2447
01:53:56.065 --> 01:53:58.975
Again, they don't file an oath, they take the oath,

2448
01:53:58.975 --> 01:54:01.975
they sign it in Alameda. Um,

2449
01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:04.935
So we are required to forward

2450
01:54:05.235 --> 01:54:09.015
to the registered voters the oath that is signed by each

2451
01:54:09.015 --> 01:54:12.415
of you that you take here, uh, before when you're sworn in.

2452
01:54:12.795 --> 01:54:15.855
So they request us to submit those signed forms.

2453
01:54:18.965 --> 01:54:22.045
I do know though though Harold, uh, from um,

2454
01:54:23.565 --> 01:54:26.645
Lozano Will Smith thank you, um,

2455
01:54:27.465 --> 01:54:29.605
did make a presentation here a couple years ago

2456
01:54:29.785 --> 01:54:31.125
and he was very clear.

2457
01:54:31.145 --> 01:54:32.765
The oath we take here means nothing.

2458
01:54:33.385 --> 01:54:35.365
The real oath is when you get your paper.

2459
01:54:35.465 --> 01:54:37.725
So there seems to be a little disconnect

2460
01:54:37.725 --> 01:54:38.765
somewhere on the line.

2461
01:54:39.645 --> 01:54:41.765
I will be glad to follow up with them on that.

2462
01:54:42.065 --> 01:54:45.005
Um, again, this is just following the government code

2463
01:54:45.225 --> 01:54:46.845
and our past practice.

2464
01:54:47.225 --> 01:54:49.045
Our current practice, um,

2465
01:54:50.115 --> 01:54:52.415
at the last election we had submit those forms

2466
01:54:52.475 --> 01:54:53.815
to the county register of voters.

2467
01:54:54.275 --> 01:54:58.615
So obviously the, either Harold is a little confused

2468
01:54:58.615 --> 01:55:01.095
with the county office of registers is

2469
01:55:01.745 --> 01:55:03.575
registrars is confused or something,

2470
01:55:03.715 --> 01:55:06.175
but not, not my place to figure that out.

2471
01:55:06.855 --> 01:55:09.335
I will follow up with that and follow up with the board

2472
01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:10.435
Please. That'd be great if

2473
01:55:10.435 --> 01:55:11.775
we can add verbiage

2474
01:55:11.775 --> 01:55:12.855
to clarify it, that would be helpful.

2475
01:55:13.475 --> 01:55:15.255
Um, so the one thing

2476
01:55:15.255 --> 01:55:18.335
that I was also concerned about is in the timeliness to fi

2477
01:55:18.435 --> 01:55:22.055
for filing a vacancy, um, I would just love something

2478
01:55:22.055 --> 01:55:23.815
that would come attached this that sort

2479
01:55:23.815 --> 01:55:26.935
of gives us a better guideline as to, it's all a bunch

2480
01:55:26.935 --> 01:55:28.695
of verbiage, but they write six months

2481
01:55:28.695 --> 01:55:30.055
and then they say 130 days,

2482
01:55:30.055 --> 01:55:31.575
they could say 180 days to a hundred.

2483
01:55:32.075 --> 01:55:35.615
It just seems like I need a chart that layer that labels

2484
01:55:35.875 --> 01:55:37.375
how all of these things get triggered.

2485
01:55:37.375 --> 01:55:38.615
Because I found some areas

2486
01:55:38.705 --> 01:55:41.375
where if you were just one day earlier,

2487
01:55:41.635 --> 01:55:43.725
it triggers a very different, the approach I mentioned

2488
01:55:43.725 --> 01:55:45.325
to you where we would appoint somebody just

2489
01:55:45.325 --> 01:55:46.445
outside a certain window,

2490
01:55:46.865 --> 01:55:49.885
but they could basically be sworn in on November 6th

2491
01:55:50.345 --> 01:55:53.725
and literally be out of office on December 17th.

2492
01:55:54.585 --> 01:55:56.765
So it'd be helpful to my opinion,

2493
01:55:56.785 --> 01:56:00.045
to chart this since it's new information about like when the

2494
01:56:00.045 --> 01:56:01.405
dates start and when they end

2495
01:56:01.505 --> 01:56:03.445
for when you're appointing when you're rolling over

2496
01:56:03.445 --> 01:56:05.685
to an election, it'd be a lot more handy.

2497
01:56:05.785 --> 01:56:07.725
And then we could actually discern, I think

2498
01:56:07.725 --> 01:56:10.405
what I was finding were issues where there were overlaps

2499
01:56:10.405 --> 01:56:12.525
that didn't make a whole lot of sense. Um,

2500
01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:13.865
Can I just clarify? It

2501
01:56:13.865 --> 01:56:16.005
says when a vacancy occurs within four months, bef

2502
01:56:16.005 --> 01:56:17.285
of the end of a board member's term,

2503
01:56:17.305 --> 01:56:18.445
the board shall take no action.

2504
01:56:19.265 --> 01:56:20.965
So I don't understand how we would be,

2505
01:56:21.355 --> 01:56:22.355
It's four months in. One

2506
01:56:22.355 --> 01:56:23.685
day it gets a little weird,

2507
01:56:25.465 --> 01:56:27.605
But then we have 60 days to fill it.

2508
01:56:27.785 --> 01:56:28.845
So that's still two months,

2509
01:56:28.845 --> 01:56:30.955
that's not gonna be like two days.

2510
01:56:32.255 --> 01:56:34.155
No, it's in a portion of the document.

2511
01:56:34.155 --> 01:56:36.955
It says that when we decide to appoint somebody to

2512
01:56:36.955 --> 01:56:40.515
that vacancy, they're sworn in, I believe the day

2513
01:56:40.515 --> 01:56:42.955
after the election so they can be

2514
01:56:42.975 --> 01:56:44.435
seated in their seat to basically

2515
01:56:44.435 --> 01:56:45.755
When we take on that, we appoint somebody

2516
01:56:46.155 --> 01:56:47.955
Actually, actually they're appointed at the meeting.

2517
01:56:48.015 --> 01:56:49.675
The same time, at the same meeting we vote

2518
01:56:49.695 --> 01:56:51.275
that's yeah, immediately.

2519
01:56:51.275 --> 01:56:52.875
Immediately in the meeting. Right.

2520
01:56:52.895 --> 01:56:56.195
But the, the decision to do that, the four month mark, um,

2521
01:56:56.435 --> 01:56:58.155
I believe in the schedule that I read,

2522
01:56:58.215 --> 01:56:59.395
it doesn't happen immediately.

2523
01:56:59.415 --> 01:57:02.235
You actually have to post, then you have to have interviews.

2524
01:57:02.235 --> 01:57:03.435
There was actually a timeline in

2525
01:57:03.435 --> 01:57:04.515
the document that talked about that.

2526
01:57:04.535 --> 01:57:07.035
So it's not like the per person immediately vacates,

2527
01:57:07.035 --> 01:57:09.275
you have a timeline to fall to basically move forward

2528
01:57:09.275 --> 01:57:11.675
with the decision to either do an election or appointment.

2529
01:57:11.945 --> 01:57:14.515
Well, the, the timeline is the 60 days

2530
01:57:15.505 --> 01:57:19.595
from when the vacancy officially occurs, you have

2531
01:57:19.595 --> 01:57:21.155
to have completed your process.

2532
01:57:21.375 --> 01:57:24.115
The process can, doesn't have to take the full 60 days.

2533
01:57:24.895 --> 01:57:26.235
Uh, normally takes a while

2534
01:57:26.395 --> 01:57:27.235
'cause we gotta get the questions

2535
01:57:27.435 --> 01:57:28.595
together and everything else.

2536
01:57:28.895 --> 01:57:31.315
But we can do it in a month if we wanted,

2537
01:57:32.595 --> 01:57:35.195
I Feel like, and, and they take effect immediately.

2538
01:57:35.495 --> 01:57:39.475
So I, I don't, uh, this is all spelled out in,

2539
01:57:39.475 --> 01:57:40.795
in state statute, so I,

2540
01:57:40.915 --> 01:57:42.195
I don't even quite understand why we need

2541
01:57:42.195 --> 01:57:44.675
to put this in a policy when, you know, we need to say,

2542
01:57:44.735 --> 01:57:45.955
see the current state statute

2543
01:57:46.215 --> 01:57:49.035
And, and I feel like we've unfortunately had to use this

2544
01:57:49.455 --> 01:57:52.035
and we're able three times and Yeah.

2545
01:57:52.575 --> 01:57:55.075
And we're able to follow it and, and do that.

2546
01:57:55.135 --> 01:57:58.195
So I, I have no problem with the way it's written.

2547
01:57:58.295 --> 01:58:02.165
And I think we need to just stick with what state ed code

2548
01:58:02.225 --> 01:58:03.445
and is.

2549
01:58:03.745 --> 01:58:06.485
It looks like these are all very clearly from ED code. Yeah.

2550
01:58:06.485 --> 01:58:08.885
The, the only problem we I see is

2551
01:58:08.885 --> 01:58:10.165
that if we adopt something

2552
01:58:11.745 --> 01:58:13.925
and the ED code changes,

2553
01:58:15.835 --> 01:58:17.725
then there could be a conflict

2554
01:58:17.725 --> 01:58:20.165
where we haven't modified our document

2555
01:58:20.505 --> 01:58:22.125
to stay up with ed code.

2556
01:58:22.665 --> 01:58:23.805
It almost seems better.

2557
01:58:24.825 --> 01:58:25.965
We just adopt a policy

2558
01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:27.805
that says follow whatever the current ED code

2559
01:58:27.805 --> 01:58:28.885
is and be done with it.

2560
01:58:30.145 --> 01:58:33.565
But that's, that's another way of handling these. So,

2561
01:58:35.985 --> 01:58:39.165
But I think, you know, new ed code would, would trigger us

2562
01:58:39.225 --> 01:58:41.335
to revise

2563
01:58:42.115 --> 01:58:43.735
New head code on any of our policies,

2564
01:58:43.735 --> 01:58:45.015
triggers us to revise it.

2565
01:58:45.115 --> 01:58:48.615
So I quickly, I think in your, in your normal practice is

2566
01:58:48.615 --> 01:58:51.735
that when there's a vacancy that occurs, you are gonna work

2567
01:58:51.735 --> 01:58:54.135
with legal counsel on developing the resolution

2568
01:58:54.565 --> 01:58:56.175
that you're gonna bring forward so

2569
01:58:56.175 --> 01:58:58.655
that the public understands the timeline and the process.

2570
01:58:59.675 --> 01:59:04.615
So ultimately it will be in confirm with our legal counsel

2571
01:59:04.915 --> 01:59:07.615
before any action is moved forward.

2572
01:59:10.065 --> 01:59:11.975
Thank you for all those clarifications.

2573
01:59:12.515 --> 01:59:14.455
Um, one item that I'd like to ask is, um,

2574
01:59:14.535 --> 01:59:15.695
I don't believe we've ever done this before

2575
01:59:15.695 --> 01:59:16.735
under provisional appointments.

2576
01:59:16.735 --> 01:59:18.455
Number two, it states

2577
01:59:18.455 --> 01:59:20.935
that we establish a committee consisting of less of corn

2578
01:59:20.995 --> 01:59:22.415
of the board to ensure applicants

2579
01:59:22.415 --> 01:59:23.735
are eligible for board membership.

2580
01:59:24.015 --> 01:59:26.535
Wouldn't we ask the county to basically validate

2581
01:59:26.535 --> 01:59:28.455
that the person is registered, you know,

2582
01:59:28.455 --> 01:59:29.855
citizen and all that other stuff?

2583
01:59:29.995 --> 01:59:32.855
Why would we leave it to two board members to evaluate that?

2584
01:59:33.955 --> 01:59:35.855
If I could, uh, jump in here on that one?

2585
01:59:36.835 --> 01:59:39.935
Um, 'cause I have the history, um,

2586
01:59:41.635 --> 01:59:44.015
we had some vacancies

2587
01:59:44.015 --> 01:59:46.015
that happened in the late two thousands

2588
01:59:46.795 --> 01:59:50.055
and some vacancies that happened in the early 2010s.

2589
01:59:50.055 --> 01:59:51.775
And that is the process we followed.

2590
01:59:53.155 --> 01:59:55.655
Uh, turns out that one of the

2591
01:59:57.415 --> 02:00:01.415
candidates we brought forward, uh,

2592
02:00:01.915 --> 02:00:04.375
it wasn't actually a registered voter.

2593
02:00:04.675 --> 02:00:07.895
And, uh, that would, that wasn't discovered

2594
02:00:07.945 --> 02:00:10.175
until like the day we were voting on 'em.

2595
02:00:10.355 --> 02:00:14.215
So we had to hurry up and, uh, register 'em.

2596
02:00:14.215 --> 02:00:16.215
And, and so we decided to scrap

2597
02:00:16.215 --> 02:00:17.975
that process 'cause it wasn't working.

2598
02:00:18.195 --> 02:00:20.615
So that's, that's why we just went to the,

2599
02:00:21.105 --> 02:00:22.655
we'll just all sit as a board

2600
02:00:22.675 --> 02:00:24.895
and interview the person, uh,

2601
02:00:24.985 --> 02:00:26.775
which we've done the last, last few times.

2602
02:00:27.035 --> 02:00:28.055
And that, that seems

2603
02:00:28.055 --> 02:00:30.215
to work better than having the little committee

2604
02:00:30.725 --> 02:00:32.615
than the, the main board,

2605
02:00:33.755 --> 02:00:36.775
But it's just as the committee to ensure they're eligible

2606
02:00:36.775 --> 02:00:40.875
and announce the names. Would that be,

2607
02:00:41.655 --> 02:00:43.075
So can I ask a, a quick question?

2608
02:00:43.455 --> 02:00:45.595
In the process where they would fill out a form saying

2609
02:00:45.595 --> 02:00:47.395
that they would like to submit to be considered,

2610
02:00:47.475 --> 02:00:49.795
wouldn't we ask them all of those questions anyways?

2611
02:00:49.975 --> 02:00:51.875
And we wouldn't need to have a quorum

2612
02:00:51.875 --> 02:00:52.955
of the board to review it.

2613
02:00:53.015 --> 02:00:54.795
It would just be something that would be submitted.

2614
02:00:56.225 --> 02:00:58.915
Well, again, the reason why you would have a resolution

2615
02:00:59.265 --> 02:01:02.795
with the process is we would need time to vet to make sure

2616
02:01:02.795 --> 02:01:03.915
that they're eligible.

2617
02:01:04.055 --> 02:01:05.875
You would not want individuals to come

2618
02:01:05.895 --> 02:01:06.955
and the board interviews,

2619
02:01:06.975 --> 02:01:09.835
and then you offer them, you choose the candidate

2620
02:01:09.835 --> 02:01:12.195
that's not eligible and that's not eligible.

2621
02:01:12.215 --> 02:01:13.835
So you wanna make sure they're eligible

2622
02:01:14.735 --> 02:01:16.115
before you do the interviews.

2623
02:01:16.505 --> 02:01:20.915
Exactly. But what we did find out was that the,

2624
02:01:21.735 --> 02:01:25.675
the board is not necessarily the best bunch of people

2625
02:01:25.775 --> 02:01:27.315
to be doing that part of it.

2626
02:01:27.315 --> 02:01:28.715
It's better to have staff do that.

2627
02:01:30.145 --> 02:01:31.195
Fair enough. Yeah.

2628
02:01:31.835 --> 02:01:33.275
I mean, staff working with legal

2629
02:01:33.375 --> 02:01:35.715
and we would submit the names to the registered voters

2630
02:01:35.975 --> 02:01:37.915
and they would actually sign off on it. Absolutely.

2631
02:01:37.975 --> 02:01:39.765
And, and, and double checking addresses

2632
02:01:39.765 --> 02:01:43.285
and all that good stuff that you have to do that's better

2633
02:01:43.385 --> 02:01:47.205
to be done by people that are more in the know than us.

2634
02:01:47.355 --> 02:01:48.485
Part-time board members.

2635
02:01:49.185 --> 02:01:51.405
That's, that's all, that's why we kind

2636
02:01:51.405 --> 02:01:54.085
of have morphed into our new process, which we don't have

2637
02:01:54.085 --> 02:01:56.085
to follow, but it's what we've done the last three times.

2638
02:01:57.505 --> 02:01:59.085
That's my only comment for this item.

2639
02:01:59.085 --> 02:02:00.165
Number two is it puts

2640
02:02:00.165 --> 02:02:01.965
that responsibly into a quorum of the board.

2641
02:02:02.625 --> 02:02:04.725
And I don't necessarily know the board has access to

2642
02:02:04.725 --> 02:02:06.845
that information or would be able to get that information.

2643
02:02:06.865 --> 02:02:08.245
So it may be private, I don't know.

2644
02:02:10.185 --> 02:02:11.405
Can we say staff

2645
02:02:11.545 --> 02:02:16.375
or district staff or a committee

2646
02:02:17.675 --> 02:02:19.735
Or you can just do the superintendent or designee.

2647
02:02:20.445 --> 02:02:22.735
Okay. Like you, like you have in most of our

2648
02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:23.935
Policies. Yeah, yeah. And working

2649
02:02:23.935 --> 02:02:25.615
with legal and the county and

2650
02:02:27.685 --> 02:02:28.685
Well, yeah. I, I,

2651
02:02:28.685 --> 02:02:32.415
all I'm gonna do is submit the, the list to the ca uh,

2652
02:02:32.415 --> 02:02:34.495
county register of voters and have them confirm it.

2653
02:02:34.715 --> 02:02:38.615
Um, but it's easier than having a committee of the board put

2654
02:02:38.615 --> 02:02:40.135
that list together and then submit it.

2655
02:02:40.315 --> 02:02:42.735
You, you'd probably hand it off to myself

2656
02:02:42.735 --> 02:02:44.855
or Vicki anyways to submit.

2657
02:02:45.985 --> 02:02:47.495
Right. And the main thing you're trying

2658
02:02:47.495 --> 02:02:48.895
to do is make sure they're,

2659
02:02:48.925 --> 02:02:51.135
they're a registered voter, which means they're eligible.

2660
02:02:51.345 --> 02:02:53.295
Right. And their address, I mean,

2661
02:02:53.295 --> 02:02:55.815
those are really the only two criteria.

2662
02:02:56.475 --> 02:02:58.095
And, and that they're 18 years of old.

2663
02:02:58.355 --> 02:03:01.335
Uh, I, I believe that's a requirement to sit on the board.

2664
02:03:01.675 --> 02:03:03.575
So they'd have to be 18 to be registered voter.

2665
02:03:04.025 --> 02:03:07.735
There you go. So do you want, do you want this one to,

2666
02:03:07.735 --> 02:03:09.815
since there's a couple of changes, you want

2667
02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:12.335
to bring this back for a third reading since we're not

2668
02:03:12.335 --> 02:03:15.535
necessarily pressed for time since we are now covered, uh,

2669
02:03:15.685 --> 02:03:16.935
with our upcoming election.

2670
02:03:18.625 --> 02:03:21.625
Sure. Great.

2671
02:03:25.895 --> 02:03:29.305
Okay. We did H one, um, H two, the disposal

2672
02:03:29.305 --> 02:03:30.825
of obsolete instructional materials.

2673
02:03:31.145 --> 02:03:32.465
I wanna make an ask or request,

2674
02:03:32.545 --> 02:03:34.505
I know in the attachment it called out the fact

2675
02:03:34.505 --> 02:03:36.905
that there are various ways to dispose of materials.

2676
02:03:37.485 --> 02:03:38.985
And I wanna ask if it's possible.

2677
02:03:38.985 --> 02:03:41.225
One of the ways you can dispose of it is to offer some

2678
02:03:41.225 --> 02:03:43.745
of the materials, the books to members of the community,

2679
02:03:43.985 --> 02:03:45.425
families, students, whoever would want them.

2680
02:03:45.805 --> 02:03:48.625
And some of the materials, granted they might be out of date

2681
02:03:48.625 --> 02:03:50.665
because they don't align with some of our state standards.

2682
02:03:50.665 --> 02:03:52.985
They're still really valid. And the reason why I bring this

2683
02:03:52.985 --> 02:03:54.145
up is I've been doing a little bit

2684
02:03:54.145 --> 02:03:55.985
of research looking at NGSS standards

2685
02:03:55.985 --> 02:03:58.865
and I have very large concerns over some of how chemistry

2686
02:03:58.865 --> 02:03:59.905
and physics are being taught.

2687
02:04:00.205 --> 02:04:01.985
And I noticed that we're actually getting rid of some

2688
02:04:01.985 --> 02:04:04.425
of our chemistry syllabus and I would be some of our books

2689
02:04:04.925 --> 02:04:08.105
and it'd be great if we would offer that to, um, students

2690
02:04:08.165 --> 02:04:09.505
and family members if they want it.

2691
02:04:09.505 --> 02:04:10.665
We just supplement what they're learning.

2692
02:04:10.975 --> 02:04:11.985
They could do it on their own,

2693
02:04:12.045 --> 02:04:14.545
but it would be, if we have the books, I sort

2694
02:04:14.545 --> 02:04:16.225
of wish we wouldn't just get rid of them,

2695
02:04:16.225 --> 02:04:17.225
that we would offer it to the

2696
02:04:17.225 --> 02:04:18.265
committee first before we did that.

2697
02:04:18.265 --> 02:04:19.985
So that was my only ask is if we could do that,

2698
02:04:22.265 --> 02:04:24.725
Uh, we could have a, a very short window

2699
02:04:24.795 --> 02:04:27.765
because I don't want to keep that, those books, um,

2700
02:04:27.905 --> 02:04:32.105
in storage, um, before we de uh, dispose of them.

2701
02:04:32.135 --> 02:04:33.135
Sure.

2702
02:04:34.005 --> 02:04:37.245
That'd be great. So I would just amend the, um, motion

2703
02:04:37.625 --> 02:04:41.665
to include, what would you say, one month request.

2704
02:04:42.505 --> 02:04:43.665
I don't think there needs to be a motion.

2705
02:04:43.685 --> 02:04:45.585
You're just asking if we could have a window.

2706
02:04:45.725 --> 02:04:47.905
It doesn't need to actually be in this motion. Perfect.

2707
02:04:47.905 --> 02:04:49.665
Thank you. 'cause we could do it now. Okay, great.

2708
02:04:49.685 --> 02:04:51.025
Um, we could done it in the past.

2709
02:04:51.275 --> 02:04:53.785
Great. Thank you so much. Um, so

2710
02:04:53.785 --> 02:04:54.905
that was my only comment on that.

2711
02:04:56.165 --> 02:04:57.945
All right. Should we take a, let's vote on that one then.

2712
02:05:01.075 --> 02:05:02.155
I guess we need a motion to vote on,

2713
02:05:02.505 --> 02:05:03.675
Well, haven't we already skipped

2714
02:05:03.735 --> 02:05:04.835
two that we didn't vote on?

2715
02:05:05.335 --> 02:05:07.115
Or, or are those coming back

2716
02:05:08.375 --> 02:05:09.375
Confused? No, we voted on

2717
02:05:09.375 --> 02:05:11.775
H one and we are bringing the next one back.

2718
02:05:11.775 --> 02:05:13.575
So I'll move that We approve item H two.

2719
02:05:14.365 --> 02:05:17.445
I'll second. Any other motions?

2720
02:05:19.505 --> 02:05:23.525
Uh, trustee Pesi. Aye. Everyone else? Aye aye, aye.

2721
02:05:23.755 --> 02:05:25.125
Carries unanimously. Okay.

2722
02:05:25.125 --> 02:05:27.765
Quickly on item H three, the only reason why I wanted

2723
02:05:27.765 --> 02:05:29.365
to pull this is because it's a fairy

2724
02:05:29.365 --> 02:05:30.645
and these students are young and

2725
02:05:30.645 --> 02:05:31.765
we have a three to one ratio.

2726
02:05:31.905 --> 02:05:33.525
And I just thought about all in my brain,

2727
02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:35.125
there's all the nightmares and disasters of

2728
02:05:35.125 --> 02:05:36.645
what happens when you're on affair with lots

2729
02:05:36.645 --> 02:05:39.205
of little people having to put on flotation devices

2730
02:05:39.305 --> 02:05:40.845
and you have two hands and three people.

2731
02:05:41.525 --> 02:05:42.645
I would love if our student

2732
02:05:42.785 --> 02:05:45.365
to adult ratio was better than this,

2733
02:05:45.475 --> 02:05:48.685
because I think just, I know that it's like a field trip

2734
02:05:48.685 --> 02:05:50.245
and so we think the ratios sound fine,

2735
02:05:50.625 --> 02:05:52.685
but to me, being on a ferry with a lot of little people

2736
02:05:52.785 --> 02:05:54.445
for the first time, I'm just really nervous.

2737
02:05:54.445 --> 02:05:56.685
Should anything go wrong, we don't have enough coverage

2738
02:05:56.705 --> 02:05:58.685
to assist each of those students adequately.

2739
02:05:59.525 --> 02:06:00.625
And do we know, for example,

2740
02:06:00.625 --> 02:06:02.545
that they have enough life preservers on this ferry

2741
02:06:02.545 --> 02:06:04.225
for the number of students that we're putting on it?

2742
02:06:10.875 --> 02:06:13.415
Um, I would have to look into that. Uh, I'm not sure.

2743
02:06:13.635 --> 02:06:17.775
It is a fairly time sensitive item as for approval.

2744
02:06:17.835 --> 02:06:20.055
As you can see, the field trip is on September 17th.

2745
02:06:20.195 --> 02:06:23.855
But I can, I can do some real quick digging on this one and,

2746
02:06:23.955 --> 02:06:26.735
and ensure that there are enough life s on there

2747
02:06:26.755 --> 02:06:28.655
for every student on the trip.

2748
02:06:29.735 --> 02:06:30.945
That would be great. I know in cases

2749
02:06:30.945 --> 02:06:31.945
where instance have happened,

2750
02:06:31.945 --> 02:06:33.785
they usually rely on the schools to tell them

2751
02:06:33.785 --> 02:06:35.065
that they need to put more on.

2752
02:06:35.925 --> 02:06:38.465
Um, but would it also be possible to increase the number

2753
02:06:38.465 --> 02:06:41.565
of individuals attending with those students just

2754
02:06:41.585 --> 02:06:43.845
to buffer the three to one ratio? That's

2755
02:06:43.845 --> 02:06:45.005
Gonna, I I guess I'm struggling.

2756
02:06:45.005 --> 02:06:46.285
Three to one is really small.

2757
02:06:46.285 --> 02:06:47.325
You're saying a single parent

2758
02:06:47.325 --> 02:06:49.645
with three kids shouldn't take their kids on a ferry.

2759
02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:52.805
Like three, like three kids in one adult.

2760
02:06:52.835 --> 02:06:54.805
Like that's a really small, I mean,

2761
02:06:54.805 --> 02:06:58.325
I've been at the zoo watching like 20 kindergartners run

2762
02:06:58.325 --> 02:07:00.765
away from me having to like get back.

2763
02:07:00.765 --> 02:07:02.845
Please. Like only three of 'em.

2764
02:07:03.165 --> 02:07:04.405
I mean, I know it's on a boat, but

2765
02:07:04.835 --> 02:07:06.205
Yeah, if you've never been on a

2766
02:07:06.305 --> 02:07:07.725
boat's basically gone boat.

2767
02:07:07.915 --> 02:07:08.965
I've been on a boat that's flipped.

2768
02:07:09.025 --> 02:07:10.405
And so I've actually seen what happens

2769
02:07:10.405 --> 02:07:11.565
when you'll have two hands.

2770
02:07:12.955 --> 02:07:15.875
Okay. I don't think that's gonna happen, but

2771
02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:17.235
I just wanna make a point of it

2772
02:07:17.235 --> 02:07:18.315
because if we don't do this

2773
02:07:18.315 --> 02:07:19.475
and something happens, we had

2774
02:07:19.575 --> 02:07:20.755
the opportunity to make a change.

2775
02:07:20.815 --> 02:07:21.815
So that's all.

2776
02:07:22.785 --> 02:07:25.585
I will say that the three to one ratio is, um,

2777
02:07:25.845 --> 02:07:28.825
is a much tighter ratio than most of our field trips,

2778
02:07:28.825 --> 02:07:31.105
including overnight field trips that we attend.

2779
02:07:31.165 --> 02:07:34.505
So I do believe that the three to one is a, is a fair,

2780
02:07:34.765 --> 02:07:35.925
um, ask from the site.

2781
02:07:40.005 --> 02:07:41.665
Any other comments or I'll take a motion. I'll

2782
02:07:41.665 --> 02:07:42.665
Make a motion. We approve

2783
02:07:42.665 --> 02:07:43.625
H three as written.

2784
02:07:43.935 --> 02:07:48.155
I'll second Trustee Piani. Aye. Everyone else?

2785
02:07:49.255 --> 02:07:51.585
No. Aye, aye Would No.

2786
02:07:51.855 --> 02:07:53.305
Four to one. Yeah.

2787
02:07:58.585 --> 02:08:00.685
And the last one I think was JS six.

2788
02:08:00.915 --> 02:08:03.125
Yeah. So I brought this, I wanna bring this back

2789
02:08:03.285 --> 02:08:04.605
'cause I know there were some changes that were made,

2790
02:08:04.605 --> 02:08:05.725
but I'm still very concerned

2791
02:08:05.725 --> 02:08:07.205
with the language and how this is written.

2792
02:08:07.855 --> 02:08:09.365
There are aspects of recruitment

2793
02:08:09.365 --> 02:08:11.125
and selection that have absolutely nothing to do

2794
02:08:11.125 --> 02:08:14.325
with diversity or the presumption of diversity being one

2795
02:08:14.325 --> 02:08:17.365
of the aspects of how we wanna decide as to who we picked

2796
02:08:17.365 --> 02:08:18.445
to work in the district.

2797
02:08:19.005 --> 02:08:20.205
I was very concerned with some

2798
02:08:20.205 --> 02:08:22.165
of the language in here alluding

2799
02:08:22.165 --> 02:08:23.525
to What I didn't understand is

2800
02:08:23.915 --> 02:08:26.005
what is missing in terms of our diversity?

2801
02:08:26.065 --> 02:08:28.565
And we talk about, we reflect on it in the first paragraph,

2802
02:08:28.565 --> 02:08:29.885
racial, ethnic, linguistic

2803
02:08:29.905 --> 02:08:31.365
and cultural diversity of the district.

2804
02:08:31.865 --> 02:08:34.325
So the first question I have is, is there something wrong

2805
02:08:34.325 --> 02:08:36.405
with the diversity of the staff we have currently?

2806
02:08:37.335 --> 02:08:38.675
And then that brings with a question of

2807
02:08:38.705 --> 02:08:39.755
what exactly is wrong

2808
02:08:39.755 --> 02:08:41.155
with the diversity of the staff that we have?

2809
02:08:41.155 --> 02:08:42.955
Now, I don't wanna trigger a question

2810
02:08:42.955 --> 02:08:45.155
or reaction saying that there's, we need more diversity.

2811
02:08:45.835 --> 02:08:48.595
I believe the question is, is if somebody is really well

2812
02:08:48.595 --> 02:08:50.355
qualified for the job, all

2813
02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:51.995
of these factors should never come into play

2814
02:08:51.995 --> 02:08:53.075
in terms of why we hire them.

2815
02:08:53.855 --> 02:08:56.625
So my concern is, again, is that we're setting ourselves up

2816
02:08:56.645 --> 02:08:59.065
for all it takes is one person who feels

2817
02:08:59.065 --> 02:09:00.625
that there was something about themselves

2818
02:09:00.655 --> 02:09:02.665
that doesn't fit into some idea about diversity.

2819
02:09:02.805 --> 02:09:03.905
Who doesn't get a job offer.

2820
02:09:04.565 --> 02:09:07.185
Having this word verbiage in this document

2821
02:09:07.185 --> 02:09:08.665
here puts us at risk.

2822
02:09:09.385 --> 02:09:12.065
I think we're liable for basically using a lens

2823
02:09:12.065 --> 02:09:13.825
that we should not include in hiring.

2824
02:09:14.585 --> 02:09:16.425
I understand why you wanna do it,

2825
02:09:16.805 --> 02:09:18.585
but I don't think you can actually go out there

2826
02:09:18.585 --> 02:09:19.945
and actually act on it.

2827
02:09:20.325 --> 02:09:21.505
If you wanna recruit

2828
02:09:21.505 --> 02:09:23.905
and you have two people to choose from, you might decide

2829
02:09:23.905 --> 02:09:25.065
for a variety of different factors,

2830
02:09:25.205 --> 02:09:27.505
but it shouldn't be the reason why you define a

2831
02:09:27.505 --> 02:09:28.745
recruitment and selection policy.

2832
02:09:29.325 --> 02:09:31.825
It should always be the most highly qualified individual.

2833
02:09:32.055 --> 02:09:34.985
Full stop. The other concern I have is when we start

2834
02:09:35.225 --> 02:09:36.665
changing our parameters for how we go

2835
02:09:36.725 --> 02:09:39.785
and actually recruit, if we start to develop parameters

2836
02:09:39.785 --> 02:09:40.865
that look extremely different

2837
02:09:40.865 --> 02:09:43.105
with extremely different results, somebody might ask, well,

2838
02:09:43.105 --> 02:09:44.305
why did you change your parameters?

2839
02:09:44.925 --> 02:09:46.945
And so if you can't prove that your parameters were just

2840
02:09:46.945 --> 02:09:49.825
to basically randomly pick whoever's most qualified,

2841
02:09:49.825 --> 02:09:53.945
but it was actually directed to target something that had

2842
02:09:53.945 --> 02:09:55.465
to do with a different view of diversity,

2843
02:09:55.975 --> 02:09:59.265
then I think you run yourself into basically a conflict

2844
02:09:59.265 --> 02:10:02.065
with, um, calling out some issue with protected class.

2845
02:10:02.115 --> 02:10:03.545
We're not actually allowed to go

2846
02:10:03.545 --> 02:10:05.825
after protected classes when we do hiring.

2847
02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:07.705
And so I can't support

2848
02:10:07.705 --> 02:10:08.865
the document the way it's written now.

2849
02:10:09.545 --> 02:10:11.545
I took an oath to the constitution, the state,

2850
02:10:11.545 --> 02:10:13.185
and the constitu, the state of California,

2851
02:10:13.685 --> 02:10:16.305
and neither one of those would actually support writing in

2852
02:10:16.585 --> 02:10:18.785
anything about cherry picking, designing,

2853
02:10:19.255 --> 02:10:22.665
essentially establishing like diversity as a goal for

2854
02:10:22.685 --> 02:10:24.905
how we select our staff and our teachers.

2855
02:10:29.155 --> 02:10:31.085
Trustee chair. Yeah.

2856
02:10:31.145 --> 02:10:35.915
Um, on this one, I would would have to, uh, uh, agree with,

2857
02:10:35.975 --> 02:10:37.235
uh, trustee Blackman.

2858
02:10:37.275 --> 02:10:41.235
I I believe that, um, protected classes,

2859
02:10:41.975 --> 02:10:43.315
um, are protected.

2860
02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:47.435
And if you have that as a factor in your decision making,

2861
02:10:47.705 --> 02:10:49.075
then you're not being equitable.

2862
02:10:49.135 --> 02:10:52.265
And it, it, it appears to me

2863
02:10:52.735 --> 02:10:57.625
that there are some unequitable, uh, parts of, uh,

2864
02:10:58.215 --> 02:11:00.265
this board policy.

2865
02:11:00.565 --> 02:11:05.265
And, and I would request that, uh, we take this back

2866
02:11:05.485 --> 02:11:06.865
to a labor attorney

2867
02:11:07.965 --> 02:11:10.505
and make sure they give it the green light

2868
02:11:10.605 --> 02:11:12.625
before we, uh, we vote on it.

2869
02:11:15.635 --> 02:11:20.255
So, um, if I, if I can understand the concern, uh,

2870
02:11:20.475 --> 02:11:23.255
in our second paragraph, we are very clear.

2871
02:11:23.715 --> 02:11:28.655
We very clearly state that we are, uh, choosing,

2872
02:11:28.995 --> 02:11:31.495
uh, candidates that demonstrate knowledge, skills,

2873
02:11:31.595 --> 02:11:35.575
and confidence and not on any bias, personal preference

2874
02:11:35.875 --> 02:11:37.415
or unlawful discrimination.

2875
02:11:37.415 --> 02:11:39.775
We also have policies on non-discrimination.

2876
02:11:40.715 --> 02:11:45.255
All we're stating in that opening paragraph is that, um,

2877
02:11:45.975 --> 02:11:49.415
ultimately we like to move towards a representation

2878
02:11:49.765 --> 02:11:52.695
that our staff represents the students

2879
02:11:52.765 --> 02:11:54.215
that they work with and teach.

2880
02:11:54.765 --> 02:11:56.615
There's no specific goals in there.

2881
02:11:56.705 --> 02:11:58.575
We're not saying we want more African

2882
02:11:59.015 --> 02:12:00.415
American, uh, teachers.

2883
02:12:00.415 --> 02:12:04.975
We're not saying we want more, uh, teachers that, um, um,

2884
02:12:05.245 --> 02:12:06.855
come from a specific country.

2885
02:12:07.315 --> 02:12:11.815
Uh, all we're saying is we are looking for staff that,

2886
02:12:12.235 --> 02:12:15.255
uh, look similar to the students that they teach.

2887
02:12:15.755 --> 02:12:17.215
So there's no goals, there's no

2888
02:12:17.455 --> 02:12:18.615
specific group we're looking at,

2889
02:12:18.865 --> 02:12:19.865
Which I understand. But

2890
02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:22.255
there was a, there's been two recent federal cases

2891
02:12:22.285 --> 02:12:25.055
that have redefined what discrimination is relative

2892
02:12:25.055 --> 02:12:26.215
to those protected classes.

2893
02:12:27.115 --> 02:12:30.375
And both the judge basically determined that by virtue

2894
02:12:30.555 --> 02:12:32.935
of setting up a direction, which doesn't discriminate,

2895
02:12:33.195 --> 02:12:36.215
but basically searches for, promotes, tries to acquire.

2896
02:12:36.475 --> 02:12:38.655
In other words, you're not pushing anybody out,

2897
02:12:38.655 --> 02:12:40.695
you're trying to attain others

2898
02:12:40.765 --> 02:12:42.175
that fit within protected classes.

2899
02:12:42.275 --> 02:12:44.415
To provide a greater balance is a form

2900
02:12:44.415 --> 02:12:46.095
of discrimination under federal law.

2901
02:12:46.595 --> 02:12:49.175
So the world has changed in the last like six months

2902
02:12:49.175 --> 02:12:51.175
with regard to how that is reviewed.

2903
02:12:51.835 --> 02:12:54.215
We cannot have statements in any of our documents

2904
02:12:54.215 --> 02:12:56.895
that talk about diversity based on any protected classes

2905
02:12:57.435 --> 02:12:58.495
and hiring based on it.

2906
02:12:58.715 --> 02:13:00.495
We need to scratch those statements out

2907
02:13:00.515 --> 02:13:02.175
and literally just not state it

2908
02:13:02.175 --> 02:13:04.415
because we put ourselves at risk

2909
02:13:05.525 --> 02:13:07.305
by actually putting out there something

2910
02:13:07.305 --> 02:13:09.425
that the federal courts have already started to redefine.

2911
02:13:09.725 --> 02:13:12.785
So in fir in that first paragraph, can you please show me

2912
02:13:12.785 --> 02:13:14.065
what is a protected class?

2913
02:13:15.105 --> 02:13:17.245
We redefine talked about racial, ethnic, linguistic

2914
02:13:17.305 --> 02:13:19.405
and cultural diversity of the district. That's

2915
02:13:19.405 --> 02:13:20.405
Not protected class.

2916
02:13:21.275 --> 02:13:23.895
All I'm saying is that you use the term racial, right?

2917
02:13:24.965 --> 02:13:26.185
That's not a protected class.

2918
02:13:26.845 --> 02:13:28.385
So race is not a protected class?

2919
02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:32.965
That's correct. Race is not a class,

2920
02:13:34.305 --> 02:13:35.645
it is not a protected class.

2921
02:13:37.475 --> 02:13:39.095
So I'm not under, I'm not understanding

2922
02:13:39.185 --> 02:13:40.535
where you're drawing that.

2923
02:13:41.575 --> 02:13:43.655
Anything in that paragraph is a protected class.

2924
02:13:46.195 --> 02:13:47.605
Okay. I guess we have different views of

2925
02:13:47.605 --> 02:13:48.725
what protected classes are.

2926
02:13:48.725 --> 02:13:49.725
Then.

2927
02:13:50.705 --> 02:13:53.855
Has our legal department, has this been run through legal?

2928
02:13:54.635 --> 02:13:55.635
Do we run all of these?

2929
02:13:57.035 --> 02:13:58.835
I regularly meet with legal counsel

2930
02:13:58.935 --> 02:14:00.235
and review board policies

2931
02:14:00.255 --> 02:14:02.155
and ars in addition to, um,

2932
02:14:02.765 --> 02:14:05.235
using CSBA language as a recommendation.

2933
02:14:07.845 --> 02:14:11.745
Was the attorney a specific labor attorney

2934
02:14:12.715 --> 02:14:13.755
specializing in

2935
02:14:13.755 --> 02:14:14.755
Labor? The attorney that I

2936
02:14:14.755 --> 02:14:16.035
meet with regularly, yes.

2937
02:14:16.035 --> 02:14:19.155
Is our primary labor attorney from Lozano Smith.

2938
02:14:19.495 --> 02:14:20.555
That's my main contact.

2939
02:14:27.195 --> 02:14:28.135
All right. Does someone wanna make

2940
02:14:28.135 --> 02:14:29.215
a motion on this at this point?

2941
02:14:35.055 --> 02:14:36.055
Anyone?

2942
02:14:38.215 --> 02:14:41.365
Which one? You, we will,

2943
02:14:41.705 --> 02:14:42.705
We will bring it back.

2944
02:14:43.025 --> 02:14:44.205
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I move.

2945
02:14:44.205 --> 02:14:48.025
We approve PP

2946
02:14:48.025 --> 02:14:50.945
4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1.

2947
02:14:51.285 --> 02:14:52.285
As it is written,

2948
02:14:54.655 --> 02:14:55.345
I'll second. And,

2949
02:14:55.605 --> 02:14:59.505
And, and if I could just point out the protected classes

2950
02:14:59.845 --> 02:15:04.345
or race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity,

2951
02:15:04.365 --> 02:15:08.505
sexual orientation, marital status, medical conditions,

2952
02:15:08.985 --> 02:15:13.065
national origin, ancestry, disability, genetic information.

2953
02:15:14.365 --> 02:15:15.465
And so race.

2954
02:15:16.175 --> 02:15:19.495
When you say racial is a protected class,

2955
02:15:19.835 --> 02:15:21.295
and I'm gonna have to vote now on this,

2956
02:15:23.275 --> 02:15:25.415
Uh, can I ask a question?

2957
02:15:26.395 --> 02:15:30.055
Was this policy, uh, pattern after CSBA?

2958
02:15:31.585 --> 02:15:34.205
Absolutely. Majority. Okay. Thank you.

2959
02:15:35.465 --> 02:15:36.525
All righty. Trustee,

2960
02:15:36.665 --> 02:15:38.005
I'm gonna call for a vote unless we have another motion.

2961
02:15:38.895 --> 02:15:43.185
Trustee Pesi. Aye. Everyone else? Aye.

2962
02:15:43.565 --> 02:15:47.825
No, no. Aye, aye. Carries three to two.

2963
02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:51.455
I think that was all

2964
02:15:51.455 --> 02:15:52.935
of consent that got pulled, is that correct?

2965
02:15:54.165 --> 02:15:57.295
Okay. There are no written reports.

2966
02:15:58.075 --> 02:16:01.535
Um, is there anything for future agendas,

2967
02:16:03.375 --> 02:16:04.425
trustee Blackman?

2968
02:16:05.725 --> 02:16:07.825
Um, so we heard today from one

2969
02:16:07.825 --> 02:16:10.145
of the public comments about safety in our school district.

2970
02:16:10.185 --> 02:16:11.545
I know we have a policy, but it'd be nice

2971
02:16:11.545 --> 02:16:13.625
to have an update in terms of how our communication system

2972
02:16:13.645 --> 02:16:15.265
is going out relative to incidents.

2973
02:16:15.685 --> 02:16:16.755
Um, that was the first.

2974
02:16:17.175 --> 02:16:19.675
The next one is the, um, syllabus

2975
02:16:19.855 --> 02:16:23.275
or all over the map in terms of both our grading

2976
02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:25.675
and other policies from teacher to teacher

2977
02:16:25.815 --> 02:16:27.915
and I believe from also site to site.

2978
02:16:27.975 --> 02:16:31.765
So it'd be great if we could have some sort of action

2979
02:16:32.025 --> 02:16:34.845
by staff to try to remedy the problems

2980
02:16:34.845 --> 02:16:36.205
that are have occurred in the last couple

2981
02:16:36.205 --> 02:16:37.285
weeks across all sites.

2982
02:16:38.385 --> 02:16:40.205
The last one is, I believe we need

2983
02:16:40.205 --> 02:16:42.565
to have the athletic department come back to present

2984
02:16:42.665 --> 02:16:43.965
how they're addressing athletic

2985
02:16:43.965 --> 02:16:45.325
needs for each of the groups.

2986
02:16:46.115 --> 02:16:48.965
Also, because I've received questions about certain groups,

2987
02:16:49.095 --> 02:16:51.605
teams at certain schools are not being treated the same

2988
02:16:51.705 --> 02:16:54.045
as other teams with regard to support and funding.

2989
02:16:54.585 --> 02:16:56.005
And I wanna clear the air on that.

2990
02:16:56.065 --> 02:16:58.285
And so it'd be great if you could bring back a presentation

2991
02:16:58.285 --> 02:17:00.565
on athletics across, especially at the high school level,

2992
02:17:00.985 --> 02:17:03.525
uh, across those, our high school sites to ensure

2993
02:17:03.525 --> 02:17:05.845
that in fact, it's not a comparison between the sites.

2994
02:17:05.925 --> 02:17:07.005
I just wanna make sure that all

2995
02:17:07.005 --> 02:17:08.005
of the teams everywhere are getting

2996
02:17:08.005 --> 02:17:09.805
what they need and we're supporting them.

2997
02:17:09.805 --> 02:17:10.805
Thank you very much.

2998
02:17:15.885 --> 02:17:18.955
Are there any other things that we can,

2999
02:17:19.305 --> 02:17:20.795
I'll follow up with you on some things.

3000
02:17:20.795 --> 02:17:24.795
We can figure out what would be an agenda item

3001
02:17:24.815 --> 02:17:26.115
and what would be something that would be more of a

3002
02:17:27.015 --> 02:17:28.085
discussion with staff.

3003
02:17:29.905 --> 02:17:33.135
Um, next up.

3004
02:17:34.355 --> 02:17:36.135
Um, and I don't think there's any changes

3005
02:17:36.155 --> 02:17:39.775
to the governance calendar from last time we reviewed.

3006
02:17:41.115 --> 02:17:45.635
Um, and then trustee reports. Trustee Speck.

3007
02:17:46.815 --> 02:17:50.355
Um, yes. Uh, we had a safety committee meeting, um,

3008
02:17:51.435 --> 02:17:52.595
I don't know, a week and a half ago.

3009
02:17:53.135 --> 02:17:54.755
And, um, we spent a fair amount

3010
02:17:54.755 --> 02:17:56.475
of time talking about the workplace

3011
02:17:56.715 --> 02:17:57.755
violence prevention plan.

3012
02:17:58.015 --> 02:17:59.275
Um, so thank you to Heather.

3013
02:17:59.735 --> 02:18:01.795
Um, a lot of work from her and her staff.

3014
02:18:01.825 --> 02:18:05.915
This is specifically for our employees in a legal, um, thing

3015
02:18:05.915 --> 02:18:09.875
that, um, those of us in the work force have probably seen

3016
02:18:09.875 --> 02:18:13.715
as well because, um, it's not just an education thing,

3017
02:18:13.775 --> 02:18:16.555
but, um, something that, uh, we've,

3018
02:18:16.555 --> 02:18:18.555
at least I know I've taken training at work, um,

3019
02:18:19.055 --> 02:18:21.515
for workplace violence, um, mandated by the state.

3020
02:18:22.015 --> 02:18:24.155
Um, also talked about, um,

3021
02:18:24.155 --> 02:18:25.875
night lock window coverings have been

3022
02:18:25.875 --> 02:18:27.275
completed on all the facilities.

3023
02:18:27.655 --> 02:18:29.515
Um, the, the cameras at Wells

3024
02:18:29.515 --> 02:18:31.155
and Fallon are up and operational.

3025
02:18:31.535 --> 02:18:33.115
Um, and then we spent some time talking about

3026
02:18:33.115 --> 02:18:34.475
traffic and parking issues.

3027
02:18:34.775 --> 02:18:36.275
Um, which, uh, those of you

3028
02:18:36.275 --> 02:18:38.435
that read the Friday email, um, from Mr.

3029
02:18:38.545 --> 02:18:41.075
Funk, he addressed, um, based off of, um, some

3030
02:18:41.075 --> 02:18:43.595
of the discussions that we had, um, in the,

3031
02:18:44.095 --> 02:18:45.275
um, safety committee meeting.

3032
02:18:45.695 --> 02:18:47.195
Um, and certainly an issue I know

3033
02:18:47.195 --> 02:18:48.875
that we've all experienced across

3034
02:18:48.875 --> 02:18:50.275
pretty much all of our sites.

3035
02:18:50.455 --> 02:18:52.355
Um, and just continue to ask parents

3036
02:18:52.495 --> 02:18:53.955
to please drive respectfully.

3037
02:18:54.415 --> 02:18:55.475
Um, it is your kids

3038
02:18:55.495 --> 02:18:57.515
and all of our kids at these schools, um,

3039
02:18:57.535 --> 02:18:59.595
and we just don't want anything happening to them.

3040
02:19:00.295 --> 02:19:01.995
Um, and then last week I went

3041
02:19:01.995 --> 02:19:03.435
to the Dublin High back to school night.

3042
02:19:03.435 --> 02:19:06.315
So it was great to see so many parents there, um,

3043
02:19:06.735 --> 02:19:10.275
and to see, um, all the great things our teachers are doing

3044
02:19:10.655 --> 02:19:12.595
and, um, excited for the school year.

3045
02:19:12.765 --> 02:19:13.765
Thank you.

3046
02:19:14.835 --> 02:19:16.515
I thank you. And make this as brief as I can.

3047
02:19:16.615 --> 02:19:18.635
So, um, attended the budget committee meeting

3048
02:19:18.635 --> 02:19:20.155
as our first committee meeting of the year.

3049
02:19:20.175 --> 02:19:21.795
So I appreciate the work of, um,

3050
02:19:21.795 --> 02:19:24.235
assistant superintendent Chris Hobbs and kicking that off

3051
02:19:24.235 --> 02:19:26.115
and providing information, uh, for,

3052
02:19:26.235 --> 02:19:27.325
I know it was at the same time

3053
02:19:27.385 --> 02:19:29.485
as I think DHS is back to school nights.

3054
02:19:29.485 --> 02:19:31.405
So I hope that if you are on the committee,

3055
02:19:31.425 --> 02:19:33.365
you will please get in touch with Mr. Hobbs

3056
02:19:33.365 --> 02:19:35.365
and, um, request some of the information.

3057
02:19:35.525 --> 02:19:36.965
'cause it is really important to have your feedback

3058
02:19:36.965 --> 02:19:39.405
before the next, or some effort of your feedback

3059
02:19:39.405 --> 02:19:40.805
before the next meeting in October.

3060
02:19:41.225 --> 02:19:44.485
Um, I also attended Emerald, um, highs back to school night,

3061
02:19:44.485 --> 02:19:45.725
which was really informative,

3062
02:19:45.725 --> 02:19:47.765
but obviously lots of issues with regard to syllabus.

3063
02:19:48.725 --> 02:19:50.045
I also attended their grand opening,

3064
02:19:50.055 --> 02:19:52.005
which was smashingly huge success.

3065
02:19:52.125 --> 02:19:54.685
I wanna thank both Superintendent Rojas,

3066
02:19:54.685 --> 02:19:57.805
assistant superintendent, Veles, as well as the PFSO

3067
02:19:57.805 --> 02:19:59.765
and all the volunteers, student

3068
02:19:59.785 --> 02:20:02.325
and parent who actually helped make it a huge success.

3069
02:20:02.345 --> 02:20:04.125
It was incredibly well intended.

3070
02:20:04.555 --> 02:20:05.925
Lots of activities, food

3071
02:20:06.025 --> 02:20:07.885
and all the clubs had a great way to showcase

3072
02:20:07.915 --> 02:20:09.525
what they were gonna offer students for the year.

3073
02:20:09.865 --> 02:20:13.285
So that was wonderful. And um, I'm just mentioning that, um,

3074
02:20:13.295 --> 02:20:16.245
after attending the Alam County Fair, that I intend

3075
02:20:16.245 --> 02:20:18.405
to reach out to all the students who placed

3076
02:20:18.425 --> 02:20:19.645
and were received awards.

3077
02:20:19.985 --> 02:20:21.005
Uh, just basically,

3078
02:20:21.085 --> 02:20:23.765
I understand our school district doesn't always provide

3079
02:20:23.765 --> 02:20:26.565
recognition, but I think it would be behoove us on the board

3080
02:20:26.565 --> 02:20:29.365
to actually reach out any event, whether it's softball team

3081
02:20:29.365 --> 02:20:31.365
or otherwise, that when we have our students placed,

3082
02:20:31.365 --> 02:20:34.005
whether the county or state level that we acknowledge them.

3083
02:20:34.145 --> 02:20:36.165
So if we're not gonna do it through the district,

3084
02:20:36.165 --> 02:20:37.925
then I intend to do it individually to each of the students

3085
02:20:37.925 --> 02:20:39.525
who participated and we're awarded.

3086
02:20:39.525 --> 02:20:40.525
Thank you very much.

3087
02:20:44.985 --> 02:20:48.925
No report. Okay.

3088
02:20:49.065 --> 02:20:50.685
Uh, attendance, a budget committee meeting.

3089
02:20:50.705 --> 02:20:53.205
And I just wanna welcome a new group of parents,

3090
02:20:53.355 --> 02:20:56.285
student representatives to that committee.

3091
02:20:56.585 --> 02:21:00.365
And they get, uh, to start the hard work of, uh,

3092
02:21:00.365 --> 02:21:03.605
discussing next year's budget and how to balance it.

3093
02:21:03.945 --> 02:21:06.885
And I also had a zoom call for the tech committee.

3094
02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:11.405
And on top of the AI policy, we are

3095
02:21:12.285 --> 02:21:14.605
bringing forth the cell phone use policy,

3096
02:21:14.655 --> 02:21:17.085
which has been in the news recently where

3097
02:21:18.505 --> 02:21:22.535
the governor is encouraging schools to, uh,

3098
02:21:22.885 --> 02:21:25.775
address cell phone use during, during class time.

3099
02:21:26.315 --> 02:21:29.615
So it'll be interesting to see what we come forth with.

3100
02:21:30.395 --> 02:21:32.095
Um, I have an idea what they are,

3101
02:21:32.115 --> 02:21:35.095
but we'll let, uh, we'll let the policy work as itself out

3102
02:21:35.115 --> 02:21:39.495
and get sent to DTA for, uh, feedback

3103
02:21:39.875 --> 02:21:42.095
and the teachers before we bring it forth.

3104
02:21:42.955 --> 02:21:44.915
And that's all I have.

3105
02:21:44.915 --> 02:21:47.355
All I could not make, I could not make the EHS back

3106
02:21:47.355 --> 02:21:51.235
to school night 'cause dropping my son off at college.

3107
02:21:51.245 --> 02:21:52.245
Thank you.

3108
02:21:52.855 --> 02:21:55.115
Yes, we were both, both gone last week.

3109
02:21:55.655 --> 02:21:58.795
Um, I forgot to mention last time over the summer

3110
02:21:58.825 --> 02:22:01.995
that I attended the, um, graduation for our students

3111
02:22:02.095 --> 02:22:04.035
who finished their diploma over summer

3112
02:22:04.035 --> 02:22:05.155
school and made up their credits.

3113
02:22:05.155 --> 02:22:07.915
And I just wanna give a congratulations to them.

3114
02:22:07.915 --> 02:22:10.115
And a shout out to our staff at the high school

3115
02:22:10.175 --> 02:22:11.875
during summer school who really worked

3116
02:22:11.875 --> 02:22:13.795
to help get those kids over the line, um,

3117
02:22:13.795 --> 02:22:16.395
and get that, that high school diploma, um,

3118
02:22:16.575 --> 02:22:17.715
and, and recognize them.

3119
02:22:17.775 --> 02:22:20.555
And we, we, we played pomp and circumstance on the phone

3120
02:22:20.615 --> 02:22:21.715
and, and, you know,

3121
02:22:21.715 --> 02:22:23.275
had a whole ceremony for 'em and it was really nice.

3122
02:22:23.375 --> 02:22:25.970
Um, and I really appreciate the effort that went into that.

3123
02:22:26.745 --> 02:22:28.845
Um, and not just like, oh, you're, you know,

3124
02:22:28.875 --> 02:22:30.765
five credits away, but we're gonna

3125
02:22:30.765 --> 02:22:31.805
get you gonna get you there.

3126
02:22:32.485 --> 02:22:33.785
So really appreciate that. Um,

3127
02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:36.745
I did just barely make it back in time for a double

3128
02:22:36.745 --> 02:22:37.745
and high back to school night.

3129
02:22:37.805 --> 02:22:40.905
Um, I would say I was actually noticing quite a consistency

3130
02:22:40.965 --> 02:22:44.425
in, in the syllabus I saw across my daughter's classes.

3131
02:22:45.405 --> 02:22:48.065
Um, and, and really noticed, you know,

3132
02:22:48.065 --> 02:22:49.105
very specific policies.

3133
02:22:49.185 --> 02:22:51.385
I, I think I look at them all a little differently now.

3134
02:22:52.085 --> 02:22:55.625
Um, and so just, um, compliments to the,

3135
02:22:55.625 --> 02:22:57.825
the Dublin High students who were all helping me.

3136
02:22:57.905 --> 02:23:01.665
I she had a period off 'cause the teacher was still on leave

3137
02:23:01.785 --> 02:23:04.385
and so everyone kept wanting to help me get

3138
02:23:04.385 --> 02:23:05.505
to class and I'm like, I'm good.

3139
02:23:05.785 --> 02:23:07.425
I know where I'm going. But they, there was a lot

3140
02:23:07.425 --> 02:23:09.785
of leadership and FMP kiddos out there helping

3141
02:23:10.385 --> 02:23:12.065
everyone, um, get there.

3142
02:23:12.405 --> 02:23:14.585
Um, and so that was a great night. A lot of good energy.

3143
02:23:14.805 --> 02:23:15.905
Um, it's always nice to,

3144
02:23:15.965 --> 02:23:17.265
to get into the classrooms and see that.

3145
02:23:17.405 --> 02:23:21.825
So, um, and that is, it's, um, for me tonight.

3146
02:23:21.925 --> 02:23:22.925
Superintendent.

3147
02:23:25.015 --> 02:23:26.345
Yeah, at the last board meeting,

3148
02:23:26.345 --> 02:23:30.025
there were two public comments, uh, with concerns around,

3149
02:23:30.445 --> 02:23:33.785
uh, traffic, uh, issues, pedestrian issues,

3150
02:23:33.895 --> 02:23:36.065
bike rack issues, and lighting issues at

3151
02:23:36.305 --> 02:23:37.745
Emerald High School.

3152
02:23:38.455 --> 02:23:40.225
That board meeting was on a Tuesday.

3153
02:23:40.465 --> 02:23:41.825
I met with staff on a Friday.

3154
02:23:42.525 --> 02:23:47.465
Um, obviously we can't control poor driving, uh, in the

3155
02:23:47.815 --> 02:23:49.665
outside of the school parking lot.

3156
02:23:49.665 --> 02:23:52.545
That's why we did an update in our Friday update

3157
02:23:52.565 --> 02:23:54.305
to reminding people of how important it's

3158
02:23:54.305 --> 02:23:57.905
to follow proper traffic, uh, rules and procedures.

3159
02:23:58.565 --> 02:24:01.745
Um, we are adjusting the signs, uh, so that people

3160
02:24:01.745 --> 02:24:04.665
that are crossing the street directly into Emerald will know

3161
02:24:04.665 --> 02:24:07.105
exactly where the crosswalk is in the parking lot.

3162
02:24:07.215 --> 02:24:11.345
That crosswalk is gonna be elevated with a new, uh, instead

3163
02:24:11.345 --> 02:24:13.425
of it being painted white, it's gonna be painted yellow.

3164
02:24:13.805 --> 02:24:16.705
It also will have reflectors on those so

3165
02:24:16.705 --> 02:24:18.465
that it stands out at night.

3166
02:24:19.125 --> 02:24:21.745
Um, they've added several bike

3167
02:24:21.905 --> 02:24:23.185
racks to the front of the school.

3168
02:24:23.215 --> 02:24:24.545
When the school is complete.

3169
02:24:24.655 --> 02:24:27.705
They will have nine different locations for bike racks

3170
02:24:27.935 --> 02:24:30.225
that will accommodate over 300 bicycles.

3171
02:24:30.645 --> 02:24:32.945
Um, but they're gonna add more immediately

3172
02:24:32.945 --> 02:24:35.345
because some of those areas are under construction.

3173
02:24:35.965 --> 02:24:39.225
Um, and then when it comes to the lighting, uh,

3174
02:24:39.365 --> 02:24:40.545
we are adjusting the lighting.

3175
02:24:40.645 --> 02:24:44.025
So they go off, uh, at a certain hour between 11

3176
02:24:44.045 --> 02:24:45.905
and 12 when the last custodian leaves

3177
02:24:46.005 --> 02:24:49.545
and then coming, uh, back on an hour before school starts.

3178
02:24:49.805 --> 02:24:50.865
Uh, or an hour,

3179
02:24:51.455 --> 02:24:54.585
approximately six o'clock when we have staff that come on campus.

3180
02:24:55.165 --> 02:24:57.305
Uh, so they'll no longer be on all night long.

3181
02:24:57.425 --> 02:25:01.705
I did attempt to return, um, the two phone calls to provide

3182
02:25:01.705 --> 02:25:04.025
that update and both those numbers were disconnected,

3183
02:25:04.125 --> 02:25:06.225
so I was not able to to reach them.

3184
02:25:06.245 --> 02:25:07.865
So that's why I'm making this public statement.

3185
02:25:08.525 --> 02:25:12.505
Um, and anything else?

3186
02:25:13.285 --> 02:25:15.745
Oh, uh, in the month of September, uh,

3187
02:25:15.745 --> 02:25:18.025
assistant superintendent, uh, Chris Hobbs

3188
02:25:18.025 --> 02:25:20.425
and I will be, uh, making the rounds.

3189
02:25:20.885 --> 02:25:24.285
Uh, we'll be having two public, um, uh,

3190
02:25:24.355 --> 02:25:26.165
conversations around our budget.

3191
02:25:26.505 --> 02:25:28.885
One at Dublin High, one at Emerald High,

3192
02:25:29.185 --> 02:25:30.805
and then we'll also do one virtually.

3193
02:25:30.905 --> 02:25:34.605
So there'll be three sessions to get, uh, feedback, uh, on

3194
02:25:34.605 --> 02:25:36.165
how to address our structural deficit.

3195
02:25:36.865 --> 02:25:41.485
Uh, also this fall I will be, uh, putting together, um,

3196
02:25:42.385 --> 02:25:43.725
uh, community conversations

3197
02:25:43.725 --> 02:25:45.605
around developing a graduate profile.

3198
02:25:46.025 --> 02:25:49.925
Uh, and that will be done at all the secondary, uh, schools,

3199
02:25:50.035 --> 02:25:53.085
with the feeder schools invited, uh, to begin

3200
02:25:53.085 --> 02:25:54.245
that conversation also.

3201
02:25:54.305 --> 02:25:57.445
So a lot of community engagement, uh, in the coming months.

3202
02:25:57.585 --> 02:25:58.605
That's all I have for tonight.

3203
02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:03.145
All righty. Um, any

3204
02:26:03.705 --> 02:26:06.225
comments on board meeting, evaluation?

3205
02:26:06.225 --> 02:26:10.465
Otherwise, I will go ahead and adjourn the meeting.

3206
02:26:10.565 --> 02:26:13.015
The, the, um, date

3207
02:26:13.115 --> 02:26:15.255
for their next meeting is not correct on here it is

3208
02:26:15.455 --> 02:26:16.935
September 10th, 2024.

3209
02:26:17.675 --> 02:26:20.255
So just in case anyone is wondering what that is,

3210
02:26:20.395 --> 02:26:21.815
um, we'll do that.

3211
02:26:21.815 --> 02:26:24.135
Otherwise I'll take a motion to Yeah, I'll move that.

3212
02:26:24.135 --> 02:26:28.815
We adjourn the meeting. I'll second Ani. Aye.

3213
02:26:29.135 --> 02:26:31.055
Everyone else? Aye, aye, aye.

We are adjourned until September 10th. See you then.

3215
02:26:35.415 --> 02:26:35.735
Thank you.
